[1926, the beginning of the reign of King Rama VII]

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.660
Damn!

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.950
Shit!

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.520
Get up! Get up quickly!

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.090
Damn.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.580
Arrest them!

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.560
Damn!

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.260
Freeze!

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.840
Fuck!

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.730
Shit, the police are all over us!

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.740
Quick, block the door with something!

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.140
Thanu! Come here!

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.380
Hold up!

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.140
I don't want to die yet.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.540
Go upstairs.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.060
I'll give you cover fire!

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.580
Stay safe, alright?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.420
Go!

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.310
Go!

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.510
Hey!

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.550
Chai Khun!

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.230
You can't die now.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.890
Thanu.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.610
Don't pass out.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.740
I...

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.020
I...

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.960
I...

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.020
No.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.260
No.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.280
Chai Khun.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.550
Keep your eyes open.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.500
Are you hearing me!?

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.680
Leave me here.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.300
Don't worry about me.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.340
Get out of here.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.340
How can I leave you?

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.500
If we're gonna survive,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.060
you and I

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.620
have to survive together.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.180
Do you want to stay in prison for the rest of your life?

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.340
No.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.000
Chai Khun!

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.660
Chai Khun!

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.630
Leave,

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.780
now!

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.780
Run!

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.660
Chai Khun!

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.650
I told you to stay awake!

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.460
Chai Khun!

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.790
Chai Khun!

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.340
How am I going to survive here?

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.060
Damn it!

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.470
I beg you.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.570
Either way,

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.440
I beg you to let me survive!

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.880
Are you scared?

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.620
Who are you?

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.020
Humans have fucking terrible memories.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.190
You were the one begging me to come here.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.320
Have you forgotten?

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.900
Me?

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.980
When did I beg you?

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.570
It doesn't matter when you beg me.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.280
But now I'm here.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.950
If you want to survive,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.620
sign this.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:07.930
Hurry up and sign

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.300
before time runs out.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.960
Oh.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.430
I forgot to tell you one thing.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.810
Do you believe it's over just by signing?

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.060
There has to be a price to pay.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.040
What do you want?

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.270
Blood.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.960
You know what it means, right?

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.260
Are you sure?

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.040
Your wish will come true.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.620
You will survive.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:13.190
[1959, the beginning of the reign of King Rama IX]

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.320
Hello.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.140
I'm a journalist named Khansorn.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:18.340
I'm here to investigate the blood moon phenomenon
for an in-depth feature article.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:20.880
Thanu...

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:24.100
Uh...

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.100
Sir?

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.500
Excuse me.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:33.420
Sir?

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.350
Oh.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.300
Yes.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.860
I'd like to book a room, please.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.370
How long will you be staying?

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.020
One night, please.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.670
Please wait a moment.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.210
This is your room key.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.040
Thank you.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.340
Hey.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.380
See that?

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.860
We almost got busted.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.700
Mark my words.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.900
Jail's not for us!

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.760
Yeah.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.700
But if they corner me with no way out,

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.010
I'd rather die.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:03.460
Here.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.140
Are you close to dying yet?

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.950
Why the hell are you touching me?

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.220
You and I have to survive.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.910
We'll survive this together.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.520
Wow.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.250
The food looks very delicious.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.930
Did you make it yourself?

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:15.650
Yes.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.760
It's just a simple dish that I can make.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.340
I grow vegetables for cooking.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.360
It's tough to find any meat in this area.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.440
Wow.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.050
This is already really good.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.220
Eh?

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.520
You even have acacia leaves.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.000
They're pretty rare to get.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.460
You'd better eat

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.170
before the food gets cold.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.260
It won't taste good if it gets cold.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.740
Try tasting the wild mushroom curry.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.000
Sure.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.840
Thank you.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.340
Wow.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.220
Is it delicious?

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:04.580
Yes.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.260
Eat a lot.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.040
By the way,

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.500
have you been here long?

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.340
How long has this hotel been operating?

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.930
It's been quite a while.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.570
So...

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.120
have you ever heard the story about the blood moon?

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.580
I just heard it from the villagers.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.810
But I don't know that much detail.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.580
But I think it would be very beautiful.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.030
As far as I know...

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.310
It happens every 33 years.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.170
Have you ever seen a blood moon?

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.080
No.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.820
I'm still young.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:12.880
Oh.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.360
So how do you know it's so beautiful?

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.300
Just imagine,

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.180
if the red light from the moon

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.300
shines down from the sky

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.310
onto the house.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.380
I think

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.180
it would be more beautiful than candlelight, don't you think?

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.190
Have you ever heard other stories?

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.510
Such as mystical stories,

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.660
supernatural things.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.380
Getting to see you again...

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.410
I think it's supernatural.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.260
But I asked the villagers around here,

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.520
and there's a story they've been passing down by word of mouth

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.280
about the night of the blood moon.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.890
They say that on that night,

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:16.940
one will die,

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.290
and another will gain eternal life.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.700
Have you ever heard these stories?

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.860
What is this?

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.350
Blood?

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.180
Hey.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.250
Your nose bleeds.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.490
Thank you.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.020
How strange.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.340
Why did I suddenly have a nosebleed?

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.530
But speaking of which,

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.170
when it comes to the blood moon,

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.630
I can hardly wait.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.900
I would like to see it with my own eyes once.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.620
Would you like to see the moon in my room tonight?

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.570
I think the view from my room window is clear.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.270
Let's continue eating.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.360
Try the mushroom chili paste

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.660
and see if you like it.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.400
Is it okay?

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.020
I think this rice is not enough.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.780
Eat a lot.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.740
So this is the blood moon they were talking about.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:22.520
Who will be the dead or the immortal as in the legends tonight?

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:43.430
Hey!

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.860
Hurry, come see it with me.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.060
It's so stunning.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.330
Hey!

00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:59.320
Thanu!

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:14.490
Thanu!

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.460
Thanu!

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:19.940
Thanu!

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:24.640
No.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.580
No way.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:32.960
No way!

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.609
[1992, during the reign of King Rama IX]

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.280
Hurry up and drink it, so we can check out.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.150
Hey, honey.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:49.100
I heard there will be a blood moon phenomenon tonight.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.560
The villagers around here say that
there will be one person who is immortal and one who dies.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.210
I wonder who is immortal and who is dead.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:02.840
It will probably be on the news tomorrow.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.100
You really are talking nonsense.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.630
I think, should we stay another night?

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.180
Hurry up and drink it, so we can hurry back.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.540
Thanu.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.310
Hello.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.340
Is this a hotel where we can see the blood moon phenomenon?

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.060
It's really you.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:45.970
Uh...

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:49.600
Hey.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.850
Hello?

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.520
Hey.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.060
Excuse me.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:59.120
Yes.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.790
Is this a hotel where we can see the blood moon phenomenon?

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:04.590
Yes.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.960
Great.

00:25:05.961 --> 00:25:07.030
I'd like to book a room, please.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.140
Thank you.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:55.890
Thanu.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.310
You're back now.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.280
Who's back?

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.130
Nothing.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.420
Have you finished your work?

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:15.860
Yes.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:17.710
If you've finished your work, just go home.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.560
There's only one guest.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.220
I can take care of him myself.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.060
Thank you, bro.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.030
Oh!

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.980
Do you wanna go to the temple fair together tonight?

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:30.580
There are many girls there.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.620
Wanna go?

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:34.660
No.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.750
Seriously,

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.440
you work at the hotel every day.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.060
Don't you get bored?

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.710
I'm so bored even after working for a few hours.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:55.000
I think you should go outside and meet other people.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.640
I told you

00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:59.730
I can't leave here.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:01.650
Why?

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.450
Don't tell me someone locked you up here?

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.140
Well.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.090
If you don't want to go outside,

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.600
then would you like me to introduce you to a beautiful girl?

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.450
In case you find someone you like

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.810
and don't have to stay at the hotel alone.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.540
Mind your business.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.100
No one can stay with me for long.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.330
Okay.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.900
Then do as you please.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.460
I'll go first.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:34.730
Bye.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.940
Wait.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.990
Mot.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:39.690
Why?

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.340
- Hey, bro.
- You don't have to come to work tomorrow.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.750
Bro, I'm a hard-working person. Bro.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:55.260
Shouldn't you check it first?

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.180
Yes.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.100
I'm giving you one day off tomorrow.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.150
Salary...

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.820
So...

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.200
Stop asking.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.710
This is an order.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.900
Oh, okay.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.290
Then, I'll excuse myself.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:14.460
Thank you.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.780
A book about the blood moon?

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.870
Has someone written about the blood moon?

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:39.920
You can't read this book.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.020
I just want to read it a little.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.840
No one is allowed to enter this zone without permission.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:47.650
Guest, please go that way.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.710
My hotel has rules.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.470
Guests here must follow my rules.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.110
What's wrong with him?

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.700
He's such a complainer.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.330
Even though I only asked to read a little bit.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.820
Why is he so possessive of it?

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.450
Let me see.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.460
There's something stuck to my hand.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.500
Let me read

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.560
what he wrote down.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.120
Wow!

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.230
Someone died on the night of the blood moon?

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.910
I'll get to see the blood moon with my own eyes tomorrow night.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:49.760
Wow!

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.960
The food looks very delicious.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.100
Did you make it yourself?

00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:59.060
Eat it.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.240
Before you die.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.210
Does he really have to speak so harshly?

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.930
Can the hotel owner to say things like that?

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:11.780
Eat it.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.020
What kind of vegetable is this?

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:19.230
I don't usually eat unfamiliar stuff.

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:23.360
Just ordinary vegetables grown next to the hotel.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.440
It's tough to find any meat in this area.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:27.380
Huh?

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.460
Why don't you buy it at the market?

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.990
If you still want to eat, then eat.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:34.830
If not, I'll clean it.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.100
I'll eat.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.960
Eat.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:38.900
Eat. Eat.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:34.750
Hey!

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:38.510
What the hell?

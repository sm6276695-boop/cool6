00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.280
Keep up!

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.120

Quick!

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.000
Yunhao, let go of all this.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.360
I've always believed

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.760
you're the best brother in the world.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.880
Could it be that in your heart,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.280
power and status
matter more than family?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.880
Enough! Look at your pitying gaze.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600
What I despise most

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.040
is others' mercy.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.280
And you, dear brother,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.480
everything you've given me
was mere charity.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.920
I've never thought that way.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.400
After our parents passed,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.440
Grandfather and you were all I had left.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.760
I considered you my closest family.

00:03:17.248 --> 00:03:19.840
I wanted to share everything with you.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.040
Stop pretending.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.880
Mu Yunqing.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.720
You've never truly seen
me as your brother.

00:03:27.264 --> 00:03:28.560
Since childhood,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.880
all the best things have gone to you.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.760
Nobody ever cared about my feelings.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.760
Yunhao.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.480
Do you remember when we were young,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.840
you took me exploring the city

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.360
and bought me my favorite candies?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.520
Whenever someone bullied me,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.720
you'd always defend me first.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.000
Yunhao.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.080
I miss those days of ours so much.

00:04:06.336 --> 00:04:07.000
Yunhao.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:12.800
There are things more vital
than power and status.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.840
Can you understand, Yunhao?

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.640
Yunqing.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.600
This is

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.800
all too late now.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.520
Yunhao!

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.320
Yunhao!

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.680
Yunhao!

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.400
Yunhao.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.160
Yunhao.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.992
(City Lord's Mansion)

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.080
Yunqing.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.800
Wan, what's wrong?

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.920
No time to explain.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.520
Come with me.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.160
Hold on, honey.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.600
Our turn is coming soon.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.280
How could this happen?

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.080
I've investigated it.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.920
They're all poisoned
by the Lingxiang Herb.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.800
But this batch's toxicity

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.280
is stronger than mine last time.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.640
Our priority now

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.680
is to find everyone

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.400
in the city growing the Lingxiang Herbs

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.120
and make them stop the cultivation.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.000
Of course.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.400
Qiming, are you there?

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.480
Qiming.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.520
(Mother, I can't fulfill my duty
as your son anymore.)

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.760
(I'll avenge my father myself.)

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.560
Qiming. Qiming!

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.640
Wan.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.240
Godmother.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.280
Qiming left.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.000
He went to Mobei alone.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.400
That foolish boy

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.760
went to Mobei without a word.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.520
If anything happens to him,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.040
what... what will I do?

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.600
Godmother, don't worry.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.240
Mr. Song will be fine.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.080
It's all my fault.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.600
I shouldn't have let him carry

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.720
this grudge against Mobei with me.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.600
If he returns safely this time,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.600
I'll make sure

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.400
he lives according to his own wishes

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.760
without drowning in hatred.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.680
Godmother, he'll be glad

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.760
that you think this way.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.360
That he went to Mobei for you

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.680
shows his deep love.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.160
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.960
I pray it's so.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.320
Godmother.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.800
Godmother!

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.680
Godmother.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.240
Wan.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.240
Godmother.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.040
My daughter.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.200
Godmother.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.440
My daughter.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.760
Godmother.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.760
Godmother.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.040
My lady, are you fine?

00:10:58.336 --> 00:11:00.080
You're Madam Hong's son?

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.360
Yes.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.520
How could such a formidable woman

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.520
give birth to such a spineless son?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.520
Say it. Why are you here?

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.760
This is the Lingxiang Herb Poison
my mother made.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.320
Unlike your toxins,

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.720
one drop is lethal.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.120
Prove it.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.560
Good.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.240
Mu Yunhao warned me
how dangerous you two were.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:43.960
I doubted him.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.640
But seeing you now? Remarkable.

00:11:46.848 --> 00:11:49.080
Seat our guest Mr. Song.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.320
The Mu family killed my father.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.720
Mu Yunqing is my sworn enemy.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.400
Thanks to your help,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.360
I finally have my chance for revenge.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.768
You Central Plains folk say,

00:12:04.768 --> 00:12:06.480
"My enemy's enemy is my friend."

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.360
Since we're friends,

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.560
we should help each other.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.480
Naturally.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.720
But you people are pathetic.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.560
My men barely broke a sweat,

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.920
and many city lords already surrendered.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.520
Only Mu Yunqing still resists.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.480
His defiance won't last long.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.680
Your warriors are invincible.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.760
Mu Yunqing will fall.

00:12:26.176 --> 00:12:28.320
Our troops are stationed
outside Jin City.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.760
After we conquer it,

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.200
you'll be our greatest hero.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.680
Jewelry, women...

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.560
Tell me what you want,

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.600
and it'll be yours.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.440
A toast to everyone.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.440
To our wise general!

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.080
After yesterday's victory,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.520
we'll conquer all soon.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.080
Exactly!

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.880
You will conquer the Central Plains.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.160
I share your anticipation.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.000
Good.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.040
Wait.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.240
Is this wine you poured poisoned?

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.880
You question me?

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.960
And our alliance?

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.200
No offense meant, Mr. Song.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.760
I must verify your loyalty.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.720
Fine. I'll drink first.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.056
Welcome, Mr. Song!

00:14:01.056 --> 00:14:02.720
May victory come swiftly!

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.920
Buddies, bottoms up!

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.080
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.600
The wine's poisoned!

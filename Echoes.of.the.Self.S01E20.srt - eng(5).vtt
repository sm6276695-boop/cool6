[Echoes of the Self]

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.330
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.780
How has

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.750
Your Highness been these days?

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.620
He's been very obedient.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.420
Good.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.260
Your Highness,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.370
it's time for your medicine.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.300
Your Highness,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.550
where is the military token

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.570
of the Red-armored Army now?

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.100
If you don't hand it over,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.300
don't blame me

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.500
for showing no mercy.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.120
Tell me where it is.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.940
Where is it?

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.740
Father.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.570
Leave it to me.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.130
Your Highness.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.570
Your Highness.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.180
Why fight to the bitter end?

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.300
Being kind to others

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.390
is also being kind to yourself.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.660
Isn't that right?

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.020
Take good care of His Highness

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.780
and make sure

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.340
nothing goes wrong.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.220
Yes.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.280
Xi is quite capable indeed.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.040
You convinced the Crown Prince

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.450
with just a few words.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.390
I'm not capable.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.810
It's because you

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.610
intentionally gave the Crown Prince
a way out.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.600
How do you know

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.730
I wouldn't kill him?

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.880
You have been planning for years.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.820
You are determined to marry
Ruoyao to Crown Prince Shu.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.900
I believe

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.140
your ambition

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.480
must be more than

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.630
rebelling.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.990
The Li family

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.500
has held imperial power for many years.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.190
It's not something that can be

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.940
overthrown overnight.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.280
So, you

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.560
want an emperor whom you can control.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.510
Then, you can replace him completely

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.980
without striking a blow.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.280
Why didn't I notice before

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.860
that you are so smart?

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.370
I was so immature before

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.089
that I couldn't help you.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.510
But in the Zhou family,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.650
I'm the one who resembles you the most.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.260
And I'm the only one who can help

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.380
you achieve your grand ambitions.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.400
However,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.130
although you can
control the Red-armored Army now,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.730
with just a few thousand men,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.780
how can we resist vast enemy forces?

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.040
Moreover,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.350
the princes' troops are stationed

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.190
around the Imperial City.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.610
If there's any disturbance
in the Imperial City,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.430
I'm afraid...

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.290
Don't worry about that.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.180
I have my own arrangements.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.000
Besides the Red-armored Army,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.220
I've also prepared arms and ordnance.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.030
Arms and ordnance?

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.520
Why are you shouting?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.420
When the time comes,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.450
they will be delivered
to the Imperial City.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.170
By then,

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.230
Qingzhou

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.700
will be impenetrable.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.810
No matter how powerful their troops are,

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.810
they won't be able to break through.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.360
But

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.690
His Majesty has already placed

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.430
heavy guards on Military Supply Route.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.410
Father,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.640
how will you manage this?

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.760
You don't need to worry about this.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.200
I have it all figured out.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.120
By the way,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.520
for the next few days,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.650
I'll be staying here

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.690
to prevent

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.600
any further incidents.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.110
I

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.130
will make arrangements right away.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.780
Your Highnesses,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.780
new information.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.920
In Liangzhou,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.980
there are indeed two merchant caravans

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.409
that set off simultaneously for Qingzhou.

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:59.510
But one took the land route

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.830
while the other took the water route.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.230
I truly don't know

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.480
which caravan is transporting

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.800
the arms and ordnance.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.270
Should I

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.930
intercept both of them

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.610
and inspect their cargo?

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.710
That won't work.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.800
Zhou Kui arranged for two caravans to
depart simultaneously

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.560
to prevent any incidents.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.280
If we intercept both caravans,

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.290
I'm afraid

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.840
it will alert Zhou Kui.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.340
Besides,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.600
Shu is still in his hands.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.590
The guards near the Imperial City

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.790
will take at least three days to arrive.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.020
If we alert our enemies,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.380
I'm afraid that Zhou Kui

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.720
might become desperate and reckless.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.810
Our current plan

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.440
depends on news from the other side.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.050
Your Highness.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.160
Why aren't you resting in your room?

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.100
Why did you come to the study?

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.940
The weather has turned cold.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.060
I've brought you a coat.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.500
Mind your own business.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.010

[Liangzhou, Wansheng Trading Company]

[Businessmen are afraid of
trade obstruction.]

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.720
These official documents you're reading

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.570
are my father's.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.250
[Zhou Yan, Market Supervisor,
Ministry of Rites]

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.260
Your Highness.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.800
Since when have you become interested

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.950
in the Minister of Rites' documents?

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.960
These days, I've been helping my father
with official matters.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.220
I realized

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.120
that being the Minister of Rites

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.480
isn't easy.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.289
Not only must one
handle diplomatic affairs,

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.929
but also one has to oversee

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.020
merchant activities.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.140
For instance, a few days ago,

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.670
the silks and porcelains sent from
Daliang to the Imperial City

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.510
could have all been transported by water.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.870
But my father was worried that

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.540
due to the recent bad weather,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.650
ships might encounter storms.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.020
So he deliberately split the shipment
into two batches.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.970
You should return to your room to rest.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.480
Otherwise, when my father comes,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.200
he'll criticize me for not taking
good care of you.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:15.660
Come on.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.850
This handkerchief

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.500
was just sent from
the Crown Prince's Mansion.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.960
Horses are printed on it.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.400
Arms and ordnance

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.610
must be transported by land.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.850
Using handkerchiefs to send messages

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.510
is an arrangement between you
and His Highness.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.410
His Highness must have
verified the information

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.410
before sending this handkerchief.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.610
Security has been tight lately

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.340
in the Crown Prince's Mansion.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.520
The people around Shu

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.760
have been replaced again and again.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.090
And Zhou Kui frequently visits
the Crown Prince's Mansion.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.030
I don't know if Shu

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.310
is safe.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.480
Don't worry.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.430
Since the Crown Prince
can send messages out,

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:11.990
he must be safe for now.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.390
We should

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.040
quickly devise a strategy

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.160
and get prepared in advance,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.560
so that we can rescue him.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.290
Liang Feng.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.710
Give the order

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.970
to intercept that shipment
coming by the land route.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:32.730
Be quick

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.620
and thorough.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.160
Yes.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.130
Wait.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.140
Your Highness.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.250
Rather than alerting them,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.740
we should switch the goods

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.710
to avoid Zhou Kui's suspicion.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.400
I've endured humiliation
for so many years.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.520
Finally, this day has come.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.120
When I put on this imperial robe,

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.060
I will reclaim my dynasty

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.480
and receive the homage of all subjects.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.880
Zhou Kui!

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.080
You...

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.400
You won't succeed.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.040
Then, let's

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.800
just wait and see.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.800
Master,

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.900
the goods have arrived at
the Imperial City gate.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.000
Excellent.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.970
Let the Red-armored Army

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.030
stand by at the Imperial City gate.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.840
Yes.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.400
Your Highness,

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.370
I'll have to trouble you

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.080
to come with me.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.450
Guards!

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:18.960
Yes!

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.300
You don't need to come with us today.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.140
You have other matters to do.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.120
Ruoyao

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.190
came back.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.670
[The country prospers
and the people live in peace]

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.570
Your Highness.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.860
Hold on a little longer.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.720
Once the Red-armored Army arrives,

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.120
we'll storm the palace.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.170
The emperor's throne

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.950
will soon be yours.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.160
You are a traitor

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.540
who deserves death!

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.120
Traitor?

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.620
Where does

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.210
that accusation come from?

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.860
I

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.690
might as well tell you the truth.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.320
I was never a subject of Yunrui
from the very beginning.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.130
How can you say I am a traitor?

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.400
Lord.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.330
Terrible news!

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.030
The weapons we transported into the city
have been replaced!

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.960
What did you say?

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.600
[The country prospers
and the people live in peace]

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.260
Protect His Highness!

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.590
Capture Zhou Kui alive!

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.710
Lord Zhou.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.350
You have nowhere to run.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.760
How did you know

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.830
the route of transporting
arms and ordnance

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.550
and act ahead of time?

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.210
Lord Zhou, you've planned for so long.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.090
But sadly,

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.910
you've failed at the final step.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.580
With just these dozen royal guards,

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.140
you think you can ruin my grand ambition?

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.880
Let me tell you.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.400
The Red-armored Army

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.730
will be here any moment.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.550
Why don't you beg me?

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:38.910
Beg me

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.330
to leave your body intact.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.140
The Red-armored Army?

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.690
The Red-armored Army won't come either.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.130
Lord Zhou.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.170
The real military token

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.810
is in my possession.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.240
You... You're...

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:01.920
Guards!

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.690
Arrest Zhou Kui, the traitor!

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.520
Who dares do so?

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:06.490
Stop!

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.050
Who dares touch my father?

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.690
Ruoyao?

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.000
Your Highness.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.100
Miss Ruoyao.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.400
Why did you come back?

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.180
Father's birthday is coming soon.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.040
I came back to celebrate with him.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.340
Where is Father?

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.490
You've come back

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.030
just in time.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.540
Your Highness.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.550
If you want her to live,

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.200
let us go.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.380
Your Highness.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.140
Please prepare a carriage for us,
Your Highness.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.720
Shu.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.760
Ruoyao.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.490
Prepare a carriage.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:00.530
Shu.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.690
Prepare a carriage!

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.820
Liang Feng.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:05.620
Yes.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:31.790
Send out the order.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.820
Arrest Zhou Kui,

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:34.650
the traitor!

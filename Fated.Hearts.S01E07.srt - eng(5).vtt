00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.009
[Episode 7]

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.590
Awake, huh?

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.070
This is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.810
very rude of you.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.790
Wouldn't it be even ruder
if someone else saw this?

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.450
I might as well kill you first.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.750
If I silence you, no one will ever know.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.400
Then you should have

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.000
done it while I was sleeping.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.750
I don't like taking advantage of people.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.560
Besides,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.520
it would be such a pity

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.850
if I didn't get to see you
begging for mercy

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.870
before you die.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.030
What a pity indeedâ€”

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.280
I've never learned

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.600
how to beg anyone for mercy
in my whole life.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.290
Everything can be learned.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.440
You could give it a try today.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.660
Your Highness!

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.620
Make him leave.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.070
Hurry up.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.000
Yes, Your Highness!

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.800
As long as you don't tell anyone about
what happened last night,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.260
we can still be partners.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.100
What are you thinking?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.020
Nothing happened last night.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.610
I saw you were drunk senseless,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.470
so I just brought you back to rest.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.710
Your looks aren't nearly enough

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.150
to catch my eye.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.380
That's for the best.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.710
But whether I kill you or not

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.210
depends solely on my mood.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.960
It has nothing to do with what did
or did not happen last night.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.030
Fine.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.310
But could you please

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.910
change your position first?

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.590
You're making my legs go numb.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.180
How's that?

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.250
Holding a knife to someone

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.600
feels rather rude, doesn't it?

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.960
What's with these lousy clothes?

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.220
Messing with my moves.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.520
What are you looking at?

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.760
Didn't you leave?

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.240
W-Which young lady

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.700
is talking to me right now?

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.920
When I woke up today,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.720
my vision was all blurry.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.040
I...

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.130
I couldn't see a thing.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.690
Then let me fix that for you.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.310
Oh...

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.850
What...

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.480
What was that just now?

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.280
I can't hear anything, either.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.170
You'd better be deaf and mute.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.659
My lips are sealed.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.659
Your Highness.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.480
I...

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.380
Get to the point.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.360
Get to the point.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.070
Xia Jingshi has come to Yujing,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.800
saying it's regarding
the marriage alliance.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.930
He'll arrive today.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.780
Your Highness,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.920
are you letting her go just like that?

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.310
How about I keep an eye on her for you?

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.390
She'll be back.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.390
Is it true that
Prince of Zhennan will arrive

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.320
in Yujing today?

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.950
This news

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.480
came from the morning court session,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.190
so it must be true.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.920
His Majesty has arranged for

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.000
the Minister of Rites, Shen Wu,
to receive him.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.860
But I heard that

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.680
Prince of Zhennan
isn't bringing many attendants with him.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.310
Does my brother know about this?

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.210
What did he say?

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.630
I haven't heard

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.360
any news from the First Prince.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.390
Your Highness. His Highness
the Second Prince is here.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.170
Sister.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.560
Guess what gift

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.850
I've prepared for you?

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.800
Well, well.
You're not focusing on your studies

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.560
and instead spending time
preparing gifts for me.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.310
Be careful, Father might punish you
if he finds out.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.440
If Father finds out,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.000
he might even praise me
for being thoughtful.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.130
Come on, bring it up.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.370
Be careful. Slowly.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.110
Sister, come check this out.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.310
This is what I specially prepared for you:

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.040
a hundred-year-old walnut tree.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.120
It symbolizes a harmonious marriage
lasting 100 years,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.720
specially chosen to wish you
a joyful wedding.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.270
I'll take it then.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.820
Thank you, Chengyang.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.040
What wonderful gift

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.600
did Brother prepare for you?

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.160
Brother has always adored you the most.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.240
He must have given you

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.770
all sorts of
strange little trinkets, right?

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.070
Sister,

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.980
where did you put his gifts?

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.390
Brother...

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.450
He didn't forget to you a gift, did he?

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.659
He doesn't approve of your marriage?

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.630
Nothing gets past you, does it?

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.080
Oh no.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.000
Brother didn't give you any wedding gift,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.750
and here I am,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.120
as your little brother
making such a grand gesture.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.630
Sister,

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.630
as for this walnut tree...

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.050
I'll just pretend I never saw
or heard of it.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.000
I appreciate the thought, though.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.710
You can take the gift back.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.600
Don't worry.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.890
I won't mind.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.190
But what if Brother

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.270
just won't agree?

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.750
What then?

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.280
I will marry Xia Jingshi.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.870
Sister,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.360
I just remembered

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.950
I still have homework to do today.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.830
I'll take my leave now.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.800
Come on. Move it away.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.070
Yes.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.600
Hurry up.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.100
I take my leave.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.040
Let me out!

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.720
Let me out of here!

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.550
Xueying!

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.040
Sister!

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.530
Don't come closer! Go away!

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.590
What's happening?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.310
Yesterday,

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.950
right after I brought the kids here,

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:04.510
these

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.290
unreasonable bastards

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.270
sealed off the residence

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.000
and wouldn't let anyone leave.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.640
I know who's behind this.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.680
Don't be afraid.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.010
Wait for me to come back.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.510
Sister!

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.059
What's your intention?

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.750
If you want to eat, have a seat.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.950
If not, keep quiet.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.150
I hate being disturbed

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.610
while I'm eating the most.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.159
So you knew about this all along.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.510
Knew what?

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:44.600
Don't play dumb.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.030
Xueying's residence

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.270
is being closely watched,

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.790
allowing people in but not out.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.030
I was wondering which bastard

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.910
did it.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.920
Turns out it really was you.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.250
Miss Yixiao, you're in quite a temper.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.630
It seems none of the dishes on this table

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.750
are to your taste.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.960
But whether they suit your taste or not
doesn't matter.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.750
As long as they suit mine,
that's what counts.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.720
Yesterday, you said it yourself

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.670
that you'd let me go,

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.630
but now you've gone back on your word

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.600
and broken your promise.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.360
What exactly are you playing at?

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.220
I'm protecting you guys.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.910
Why can't you appreciate
my good intentions?

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.720
Protecting?

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.520
This is clearly imprisonment!

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.330
Imprisonment?

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.290
The entire Yujing City

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.290
is my territory,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.720
all under my control.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.120
And you're someone I brought back myself.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.980
Would I even need to imprison you?

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.270
Can you possibly escape from my grasp?

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.950
As my defeated opponent,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.340
you sure have quite the attitude.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.100
Looks like

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.240
you don't want to cooperate after all.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240
Of course I do.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.870
But it has to be me

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.550
who sets the ground rules.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.360
You have your rules,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.290
and I have mine.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.870
It's not solely up to you.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.820
Your Highness.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.270
All our men in the Feng Battalion know

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.960
that Susha is to form a marriage alliance
with Jinxiu.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.630
Somehow a rumor has spread,

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.480
saying that Your Highness

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.910
opposes the marriage alliance,

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.240
and that His Majesty is going to
strip you of your military command.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.880
Our men are furious

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.320
and threaten to confront the court.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.360
I fear a mutiny may break out
in the ranks.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.290
Utter nonsense!

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.800
Order all Military Commanders
and Deputy Generals

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.330
to come see me immediately.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.360
Yes, Your Highness.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.320
Go find out

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.600
exactly who's trying to
undermine army morale.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.020
Those deliberately spreading rumors

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.290
must not be spared.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.640
Yes, Your Highness.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.030
The Feng Battalion
has always had iron discipline

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.910
and stands as the model
for all the armies.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.200
Every soldier faithfully
fulfills their duties

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.290
and obeys orders.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.080
Now it's said the army

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.360
is restless with signs of mutiny,

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.270
but I don't believe it.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.120
If you ask me,

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.840
it must be you

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.370
leading officers
whose hearts are wavering.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.670
Everyone here

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.670
has been through

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.710
life and death alongside me.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.130
There are no outsiders here today.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.000
If you have any complaints,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.530
please speak up freely
and hold nothing back.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.610
Your Highness,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.120
there's one thing I don't understand.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.150
Susha and Jinxiu

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200
have such deep-seated hatred,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.080
and now, all of a sudden, we are to form
a marriage alliance to seek peace.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.880
Could it be...

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.600
Could it be because

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.790
we lost the battle at Pingling City

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.050
that we must humble ourselves for peace?

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.200
I believe this is the very question

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.980
on all of your minds.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.240
That battle at Pingling City was fought
by us.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.510
If this marriage alliance
is because we lost,

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.400
then how can I

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.870
face all my brothers in arms?

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.240
Utter nonsense!

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.030
A marriage alliance between two kingdoms
is such a momentous matter,

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.510
affecting the major affairs
of both kingdoms.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.390
How could it be determined

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.450
by a single battle?

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.960
Besides, let's be clearâ€”

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.720
it was Jinxiu that proposed
this marriage alliance.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.310
Why?

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.720
Because they chickened out.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.360
They don't dare fight us anymore.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.720
They want to use the Battle of Pingling

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.480
as a graceful exit,

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.480
and that's why they came to us
with this marriage alliance proposal.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.670
It was Emperor of Jinxiu
who proposed the marriage alliance,

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.840
yet you're all

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.790
sulking and feeling resentful here.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.000
What are you trying to do?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.510
Are you trying to force His Highness
to rebel?

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.080
Enough!

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.300
You only need to remember two things.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.330
First,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.670
the defeat of Battle of Pingling
was my fault.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.630
None of our soldiers in the Feng Battalion
are to blame.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.750
Your Highness, how could it be your fault?

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.390
Second,

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.960
regarding the marriage alliance,

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.450
I have agreed to it.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.790
I understand

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.030
any grievances our soldiers may have,

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.760
and I'll take responsibility.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.670
Any resentment our soldiers feel,

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.270
let it be counted against me.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.510
But you must tell everyone

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.480
that His Majesty has not stripped me
of my military power,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.260
and no one at court
is plotting against me.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.050
The weapons of our Feng Battalion

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.510
will only ever be pointed at our enemies,

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.840
never at our own people,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.870
and mutiny will never be tolerated!

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.130
Yes, Your Highness!

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.030
Your Highness,
I have urgent news to report.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.660
Speak.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.780
Yun Qing's dagger?

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.460
This is the dagger
you previously awarded to Yun Qing.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.360
He values it more than his life

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.690
and never parts with it.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.120
How did it end up with you?

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.870
Your Highness,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:32.510
Yun Qing quietly left

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.080
the camp early this morning.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.200
He left this dagger

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.080
with a message for Your Highness,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.910
that he intends to kill someone
on Your Highness's behalf,

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.410
and that he's failed you in this life

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.240
and wasted your cultivation.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.100
Is he leaving the Feng Battalion?

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.400
You may leave.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.320
Yes.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:51.670
What does he mean?

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.960
Who does he want to kill?

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.160
You said this morning

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.520
that Xia Jingshi is arriving in Yujing?

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.500
Yes, he's arriving today.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.910
[Yujing Border]

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.210
He intends to kill Xia Jingshi?

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.270
Xia Jingshi is coming for
the marriage alliance.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.600
If he dies in Yujing,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.980
Susha will be accused

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.440
of betrayal and dishonor,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.400
and Yun Qing's crime will be unforgivable.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.150
Please, Your Highness, save Yun Qing.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.720
Yun Qing is completely loyal
to Your Highness.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.390
He knows that Your Highness

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.910
cannot kill Xia Jingshi yourself,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.570
so he wants to kill him for you.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.980
How can he be so foolish?

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.030
If he does this,

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.720
isn't he just giving up

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.790
all his hard-earned military achievements

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.250
and his promising future?

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.370
Yun Qing is your sworn brother,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.790
but he's also like a little brother to me.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.520
Don't worry.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.040
I'll definitely find a way to stop him.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.720
But...

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.060
Your Highness,

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.530
Yun Qing is the best archer

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.620
in our battalion,

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.990
and he knows the terrain well.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.520
If he wants to kill Xia Jingshi,
I'm afraid...

00:14:59.200 --> 00:14:59.730
Besides,

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.110
where would we even find him?

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.070
Why should I help you?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.630
As long as you help me find him,

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.960
you can name your price.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.670
I have no price to name,

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.330
and I don't have that ability.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.080
Although you've lost

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.540
the strength to draw a bow,

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.360
you still have an archer's keen eyes

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.660
and experience.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.870
Well, I'm flattered.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.000
Yun Qing doesn't know

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.790
Xia Jingshi's exact time of arrival
in Yujing,

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.030
so he can only lie in wait

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.520
for Xia Jingshi to appear.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.170
The most secure position to strike

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.700
would be near the city gate.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.120
The terrain outside the city gate
is too open,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.630
leaving Yun Qing nowhere to hide,

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.560
so he can only stay inside the gate.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.550
What you need to do is simple:

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.480
just tell me

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.580
if you were to assassinate Xia Jingshi,

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.380
what position would you choose?

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.790
If it's really as simple as you say,

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.390
then why bother coming to me?

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.360
I'm sure there are

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.720
plenty of skilled archers

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.270
in your army as well.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.550
You probably don't know that

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.510
Yun Qing is considered Susha's

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.840
most formidable archer.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.080
Ordinary archers can't even imagine

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.610
how formidable he truly is.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:03.600
Miss Yixiao,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.720
you are

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.840
the greatest archer in the world.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.910
Right now, only you can guess

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.710
what Yun Qing might be thinking.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.630
I'm not nearly as skilled as you say.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.160
It's not worth mentioning.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.800
See how good he is with words?

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.970
When asking for help,
one should act like it.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.020
Tell me, what are your conditions?

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.650
I can agree to three of them.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.280
That's not what you said just now.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.210
Fine.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.010
Five it is.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.620
"The entire Yujing City

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.390
is my territory.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.240
Everything's under my control."

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.750
First Prince,
you're truly impressive, huh?

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:51.690
If you're really that impressive,

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.690
how come you can't even find someone

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.090
when you want to?

Are you suggesting

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.940
Yun Qing would choose a closer position?

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:27.920
He knew you would

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.960
try to stop him,

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.240
so he deliberately took

a two-picul bow.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.270
But have you considered that

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.170
a two-picul bow is so large,

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.000
and bringing it to a crowded area

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.240
would make him too conspicuous?

to deceive us,

he left his personal token.

This shows that after the assassination,

he doesn't want to implicate
the Feng Battalion,

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.200

[Nan]

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.630
From this day on, join the Zhennan Army

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.410
and swear loyalty unto death
to His Highness!

Those who kill the people of Jinxiu,

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.440
I shall devour their flesh
and drink their blood!

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.750
Those who slay even one soldier
of the Zhennan Army,

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:31.960
I shall execute without mercy!

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.920

I vow to stay by your side till death.

Would you be willing

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.490
to marry me in your bridal finery?

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.520
What's wrong?

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.720
I will share life and death
with Your Highness!

This is a military order!

Prince of Zhennan, you've come from afar.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.440
The journey must have been tiring.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.080
Minister Shen, no need for
such formalities.

please follow me to the carriage.

Loosen your grip,

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.350
will you?

Alright?

Simple folk customs indeed.

I have come to Susha

to marry Princess Xiyang.

Our Emperor

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.090
sincerely wishes

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.160
for lasting friendship
between our two kingdoms

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.290
and for the people to enjoy
a life of peace and stability.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.490
In times of war,

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:26.120
it's always the common people who suffer.

I,

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.490
like the Emperor of Jinxiu,

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.070
wish for peace throughout the land.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.160
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.890
Princess Xiyang and I

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.510
will do everything to maintain peace
between our two kingdoms.

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:42.350
I was worried

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:44.480
about Xiyang marrying into a foreign land,

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.460
but today,

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.350
seeing your fine character,
Prince of Zhennan,

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.890
I feel much more at ease.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.970
In the future,

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.850
I hope you will treat each other

Your Majesty,

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.200
I've obtained permission from our Emperor

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.110
to return all Susha warriors

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.850

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.400
in the Battle of Pingling,

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.510
hoping our kingdoms will maintain
friendly relations for centuries

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.770
and lasting peace throughout the world.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.400
It's thoughtful of you, Prince of Zhennan.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.530
When the time comes,

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.500
all Jinxiu prisoners

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.240
will be handed over to you

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.490
and return with you to Jinxiu.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.880
Now that the two kingdoms
have ceased hostilities and made peace,

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.520
Prince of Zhennan and Xiyang

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.920
deserve much credit.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.030
This way please, Prince of Zhennan.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.750
Your Majesty.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:03.450
Please sit.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.550
Bring some wine.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.070
Your Majesty,

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.590
it's not yet noon,
not suitable for drinking.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.590
I'm meeting my future son-in-law.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:18.730
Doesn't that deserve a drink?

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.630
As you command.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.780
Neither sitting nor bowing.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.000
If you marry my daughter,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.199
you'll be my junior.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.230
You're a prince, and I'm an emperor.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.360
There's a distinction
between ruler and subject.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.159
Shouldn't you

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.530
bow to me?

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.390
Your Majesty,

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.320
let tea serve as my drink.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.750
Are you trying to treat me as your equal?

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.050
When I marry the princess,

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.320
I'll observe the proper etiquette
between father and son-in-law.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.980
Why not wait until the wine's served?

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.590
To express my sincerity,

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:37.510
whether it's tea or wine,

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.420
what difference does it make?

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.180
Try this.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.110
How is it?

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.920
Princess Xiyang has a sweet tooth.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.630
How do you know

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.910
these are Xiyang's favorite pastries?

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.190
Your Majesty is a man of great talent
and broad vision,

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.670
with the world in your heart.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:15.320
Recommending such sweet pastries to me

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.740
certainly isn't because

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.380
you like them yourself.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.670
I suppose

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.670
Your Majesty wants to test

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.000
if Princess Xiyang and I

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.360
have compatible tastes,

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:24.910
right?

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.320
Prince of Zhennan,
you're quite perceptive.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.570
The pastries you just had

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.440
were created by Xiyang herself

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.370
when she was only seven years old.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.000
Her mother said that as a princess,

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.360
she shouldn't be cooking herself

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.040
and should let the royal chefs handle it.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.230
But Xiyang insisted

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.280
that these pastries

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.490
were meant for her family,

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.880
and she couldn't entrust them to others.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.580
Therefore,

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.040
in this entire world,

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.960
only she and her two brothers,

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.400
myself, and the Empress have tasted them.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.050
And now, you're the sixth.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.710
It's truly enviable

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.420
to hear Your Majesty speak

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.110
so fondly of family matters.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.170
I know that

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.320
although you and the Emperor of Jinxiu

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.320
are brothers, you're not close.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.030
My children are different.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.970
Though they were not born
of the same mother,

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.440
their bond as siblings

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.540
is deep and strong,

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:19.480
second to none.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.460
That's wonderful.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:22.840
And?

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.840
The marriage between you and Xiyang

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.630
was Xiyang's own choice.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.530
I know that

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:34.510
others say Susha was defeated

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.660
and could only buy a few years of peace

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.930
by marrying off a princess.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.510
They are wrong.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.800
If it weren't for
Xiyang's affection for you,

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.630
I would never

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.070
trade my beloved daughter's
lifelong happiness

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.880
for a few years of peace in Susha.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.780
What I mean is

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:58.800
I

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:01.710
will absolutely not allow Jinxiu
to fail Xiyang.

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:02.710
In this marriage,

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.190
what I want is my daughter's

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:05.710
happiness and well-being.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.110
I

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.280
will not give you

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.140
any chance to disappoint Xiyang.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.230
Your Majesty speaks wisely.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.190
Kingdom affairs are kingdom affairs,

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.390
and family matters are family matters.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.760
I won't confuse the two.

I'm looking for Feng Suige.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.800
Who do you think you are,

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.200
daring to call the First Prince
by his name?

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.950
Ning Fei from Jinxiu.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.760
Get lost!

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:01.840
Is Fu Yixiao

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.680
here with you?

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.820
Get lost, get lost.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.920
You...

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.110
Feng Suige!

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.960
Feng Suige, come out here!

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.400
[Wutong Mansion]

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.130
Feng Suige!

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.540
I know you're in there.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.800
Why are you making so much noise?

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.810
Yixiao needs to rest.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:15.850
Miss Ling,

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.110
it's me,

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:18.910
Ning Fei from Jinxiu.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:20.190
I don't care who you are.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.760
Stop making such a racket here.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.700
Yixiao is ill and needs rest.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.060
What's wrong with her?

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.280
If you're smart, you won't persist.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.030
Her affairs are none of your business.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.710
Just leave.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.320
Yixiao isn't seeing anyone.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.380
Take me to see her.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.550
I'll just take a look at her
from a distance,

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:37.480
without disturbing her any further.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.030
[Wutong Mansion]

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.890
-Take your hands off me.
-Who's being so noisy here?

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.110
Please step aside, Miss.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.740
I don't want to hurt you.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.070
Hand Yixiao over to me.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.150
Do you want to die?

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.990
I'm talking to you!

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.700
[Wutong Mansion]

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.060
So this is Jinxiu's greatest warrior?

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.570
I haven't even said it was on.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.520
[Wutong Mansion]

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.540
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.800
Mr. Ma,

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.950
I'd like a word with Prince of Zhennan.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.290
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.510
Do you still remember me?

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.000
We've never met before,

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.850
so how could I remember you?

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.020
So you really don't remember.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.840
Three years ago,

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:08.490
at the border between Jinxiu and Susha,

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.400
on the desert.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.840
Prince of Zhennan, you should know that

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.590
my father is a warrior emperor

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.590
who founded our kingdom
through military might,

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.650
and my brother is the commander of
Susha's three armies,

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:19.670
so I can be considered
coming from a military family.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.030
Given my background,

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.480
I also thought about achieving glory

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.630
on the battlefield

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.840
like my father and brother did.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.590
It's not that I enjoy war.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:29.190
I just believe

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:30.710
that as a princess,

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.550
I should do something
to serve our kingdom.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.890
You don't have to go to war
to serve your kingdom.

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.020
You have your own duties as a princess.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.260
What you just said

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.630
is exactly the same as

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:43.360
what my brother said back then.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.630
Three years ago,

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.920
I wanted to follow my brother to battle,

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.150
but he wouldn't allow it.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:49.800
But I was young and impetuous then,

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.280
and somehow found the courage

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.070
to secretly acquire a suit of armor.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:53.840
I pulled some strings,

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.030
snuck into the army,

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.150
and followed the troops into battle.

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:58.400
My brother

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.330
started from the bottom level

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.630
and made military achievements
step by step

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.110
until he became commander.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:05.600
I wanted to be like him.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.960
But on the second day of the campaign,

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.510
I ran into trouble.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.230
I had heard from my brother

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:12.480
that there was a shortcut

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.290
in the desert.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.380
To catch up with my brother,

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.360
I slipped away from my attendants,

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.190
intending to take that shortcut.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.280
Little did I know

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:23.080
I would be completely lost.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:28.000
What was even more desperate
than my dire situation was

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.930
that I was discovered by the enemy.

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:04.480
It's a woman.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:28.690
I don't kill women.

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.560
Let's go.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.570
â™ª Flying alone â™ª

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:02.640
â™ª With no need for direction â™ª

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.380
â™ª Flying up to the clouds â™ª

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.340
â™ª Yet the sun is hiding â™ª

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:11.940
That water pouch saved my life.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.190
â™ª Roaming freely â™ª

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:14.260
I survived for two more days,

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:15.030
â™ª Unafraid of wind or frost â™ª

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.070
until my brother

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.070
came to my rescue.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.510
There was a name
carved on that water pouch:

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:20.960
â™ª The wet wings â™ª

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.830
Xia Jingshi.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:24.320
â™ª Will carry me far away â™ª

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.380
Prince of Zhennan.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.090
It was you who saved me that day,

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.710
and it was also you who spared my life.

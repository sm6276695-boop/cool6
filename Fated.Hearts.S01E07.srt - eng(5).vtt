00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.009
[Episode 7]

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.590
Awake, huh?

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.070
This is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.810
very rude of you.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.790
Wouldn't it be even ruder
if someone else saw this?

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.450
I might as well kill you first.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.750
If I silence you, no one will ever know.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.400
Then you should have

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.000
done it while I was sleeping.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.750
I don't like taking advantage of people.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.560
Besides,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.520
it would be such a pity

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.850
if I didn't get to see you
begging for mercy

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.870
before you die.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.030
What a pity indeed—

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.280
I've never learned

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.600
how to beg anyone for mercy
in my whole life.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.290
Everything can be learned.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.440
You could give it a try today.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.660
Your Highness!

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.620
Make him leave.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.070
Hurry up.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.000
Yes, Your Highness!

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.800
As long as you don't tell anyone about
what happened last night,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.260
we can still be partners.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.100
What are you thinking?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.020
Nothing happened last night.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.610
I saw you were drunk senseless,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.470
so I just brought you back to rest.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.710
Your looks aren't nearly enough

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.150
to catch my eye.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.380
That's for the best.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.710
But whether I kill you or not

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.210
depends solely on my mood.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.960
It has nothing to do with what did
or did not happen last night.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.030
Fine.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.310
But could you please

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.910
change your position first?

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.590
You're making my legs go numb.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.180
How's that?

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.250
Holding a knife to someone

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.600
feels rather rude, doesn't it?

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.960
What's with these lousy clothes?

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.220
Messing with my moves.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.520
What are you looking at?

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.760
Didn't you leave?

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.240
W-Which young lady

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.700
is talking to me right now?

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.920
When I woke up today,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.720
my vision was all blurry.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.040
I...

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.130
I couldn't see a thing.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.690
Then let me fix that for you.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.310
Oh...

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.850
What...

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.480
What was that just now?

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.280
I can't hear anything, either.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.170
You'd better be deaf and mute.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.659
My lips are sealed.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.659
Your Highness.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.480
I...

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.380
Get to the point.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.360
Get to the point.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.070
Xia Jingshi has come to Yujing,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.800
saying it's regarding
the marriage alliance.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.930
He'll arrive today.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.780
Your Highness,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.920
are you letting her go just like that?

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.310
How about I keep an eye on her for you?

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.390
She'll be back.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.390
Is it true that
Prince of Zhennan will arrive

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.320
in Yujing today?

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.950
This news

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.480
came from the morning court session,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.190
so it must be true.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.920
His Majesty has arranged for

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.000
the Minister of Rites, Shen Wu,
to receive him.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.860
But I heard that

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.680
Prince of Zhennan
isn't bringing many attendants with him.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.310
Does my brother know about this?

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.210
What did he say?

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.630
I haven't heard

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.360
any news from the First Prince.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.390
Your Highness. His Highness
the Second Prince is here.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.170
Sister.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.560
Guess what gift

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.850
I've prepared for you?

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.800
Well, well.
You're not focusing on your studies

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.560
and instead spending time
preparing gifts for me.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.310
Be careful, Father might punish you
if he finds out.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.440
If Father finds out,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.000
he might even praise me
for being thoughtful.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.130
Come on, bring it up.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.370
Be careful. Slowly.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.110
Sister, come check this out.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.310
This is what I specially prepared for you:

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.040
a hundred-year-old walnut tree.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.120
It symbolizes a harmonious marriage
lasting 100 years,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.720
specially chosen to wish you
a joyful wedding.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.270
I'll take it then.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.820
Thank you, Chengyang.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.040
What wonderful gift

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.600
did Brother prepare for you?

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.160
Brother has always adored you the most.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.240
He must have given you

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.770
all sorts of
strange little trinkets, right?

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.070
Sister,

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.980
where did you put his gifts?

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.390
Brother...

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.450
He didn't forget to you a gift, did he?

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.659
He doesn't approve of your marriage?

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.630
Nothing gets past you, does it?

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.080
Oh no.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.000
Brother didn't give you any wedding gift,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.750
and here I am,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.120
as your little brother
making such a grand gesture.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.630
Sister,

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.630
as for this walnut tree...

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.050
I'll just pretend I never saw
or heard of it.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.000
I appreciate the thought, though.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.710
You can take the gift back.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.600
Don't worry.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.890
I won't mind.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.190
But what if Brother

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.270
just won't agree?

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.750
What then?

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.280
I will marry Xia Jingshi.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.870
Sister,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.360
I just remembered

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.950
I still have homework to do today.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.830
I'll take my leave now.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.800
Come on. Move it away.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.070
Yes.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.600
Hurry up.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.100
I take my leave.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.040
Let me out!

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.720
Let me out of here!

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.550
Xueying!

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.040
Sister!

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.530
Don't come closer! Go away!

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.590
What's happening?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.310
Yesterday,

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.950
right after I brought the kids here,

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:04.510
these

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.290
unreasonable bastards

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.270
sealed off the residence

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.000
and wouldn't let anyone leave.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.640
I know who's behind this.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.680
Don't be afraid.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.010
Wait for me to come back.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.510
Sister!

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.059
What's your intention?

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.750
If you want to eat, have a seat.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.950
If not, keep quiet.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.150
I hate being disturbed

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.610
while I'm eating the most.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.159
So you knew about this all along.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.510
Knew what?

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:44.600
Don't play dumb.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.030
Xueying's residence

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.270
is being closely watched,

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.790
allowing people in but not out.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.030
I was wondering which bastard

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.910
did it.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.920
Turns out it really was you.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.250
Miss Yixiao, you're in quite a temper.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.630
It seems none of the dishes on this table

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.750
are to your taste.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.960
But whether they suit your taste or not
doesn't matter.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.750
As long as they suit mine,
that's what counts.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.720
Yesterday, you said it yourself

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.670
that you'd let me go,

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.630
but now you've gone back on your word

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.600
and broken your promise.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.360
What exactly are you playing at?

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.220
I'm protecting you guys.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.910
Why can't you appreciate
my good intentions?

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.720
Protecting?

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.520
This is clearly imprisonment!

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.330
Imprisonment?

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.290
The entire Yujing City

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.290
is my territory,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.720
all under my control.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.120
And you're someone I brought back myself.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.980
Would I even need to imprison you?

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.270
Can you possibly escape from my grasp?

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.950
As my defeated opponent,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.340
you sure have quite the attitude.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.100
Looks like

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.240
you don't want to cooperate after all.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240
Of course I do.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.870
But it has to be me

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.550
who sets the ground rules.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.360
You have your rules,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.290
and I have mine.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.870
It's not solely up to you.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.820
Your Highness.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.270
All our men in the Feng Battalion know

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.960
that Susha is to form a marriage alliance
with Jinxiu.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.630
Somehow a rumor has spread,

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.480
saying that Your Highness

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.910
opposes the marriage alliance,

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.240
and that His Majesty is going to
strip you of your military command.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.880
Our men are furious

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.320
and threaten to confront the court.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.360
I fear a mutiny may break out
in the ranks.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.290
Utter nonsense!

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.800
Order all Military Commanders
and Deputy Generals

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.330
to come see me immediately.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.360
Yes, Your Highness.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.320
Go find out

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.600
exactly who's trying to
undermine army morale.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.020
Those deliberately spreading rumors

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.290
must not be spared.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.640
Yes, Your Highness.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.030
The Feng Battalion
has always had iron discipline

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.910
and stands as the model
for all the armies.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.200
Every soldier faithfully
fulfills their duties

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.290
and obeys orders.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.080
Now it's said the army

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.360
is restless with signs of mutiny,

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.270
but I don't believe it.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.120
If you ask me,

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.840
it must be you

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.370
leading officers
whose hearts are wavering.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.670
Everyone here

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.670
has been through

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.710
life and death alongside me.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.130
There are no outsiders here today.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.000
If you have any complaints,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.530
please speak up freely
and hold nothing back.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.610
Your Highness,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.120
there's one thing I don't understand.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.150
Susha and Jinxiu

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200
have such deep-seated hatred,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.080
and now, all of a sudden, we are to form
a marriage alliance to seek peace.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.880
Could it be...

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.600
Could it be because

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.790
we lost the battle at Pingling City

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.050
that we must humble ourselves for peace?

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.200
I believe this is the very question

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.980
on all of your minds.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.240
That battle at Pingling City was fought
by us.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.510
If this marriage alliance
is because we lost,

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.400
then how can I

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.870
face all my brothers in arms?

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.240
Utter nonsense!

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.030
A marriage alliance between two kingdoms
is such a momentous matter,

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.510
affecting the major affairs
of both kingdoms.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.390
How could it be determined

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.450
by a single battle?

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.960
Besides, let's be clear—

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.720
it was Jinxiu that proposed
this marriage alliance.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.310
Why?

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.720
Because they chickened out.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.360
They don't dare fight us anymore.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.720
They want to use the Battle of Pingling

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.480
as a graceful exit,

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.480
and that's why they came to us
with this marriage alliance proposal.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.670
It was Emperor of Jinxiu
who proposed the marriage alliance,

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.840
yet you're all

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.790
sulking and feeling resentful here.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.000
What are you trying to do?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.510
Are you trying to force His Highness
to rebel?

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.080
Enough!

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.300
You only need to remember two things.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.330
First,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.670
the defeat of Battle of Pingling
was my fault.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.630
None of our soldiers in the Feng Battalion
are to blame.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.750
Your Highness, how could it be your fault?

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.390
Second,

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.960
regarding the marriage alliance,

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.450
I have agreed to it.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.790
I understand

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.030
any grievances our soldiers may have,

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.760
and I'll take responsibility.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.670
Any resentment our soldiers feel,

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.270
let it be counted against me.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.510
But you must tell everyone

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.480
that His Majesty has not stripped me
of my military power,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.260
and no one at court
is plotting against me.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.050
The weapons of our Feng Battalion

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.510
will only ever be pointed at our enemies,

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.840
never at our own people,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.870
and mutiny will never be tolerated!

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.130
Yes, Your Highness!

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.030
Your Highness,
I have urgent news to report.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.660
Speak.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.780
Yun Qing's dagger?

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.460
This is the dagger
you previously awarded to Yun Qing.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.360
He values it more than his life

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.690
and never parts with it.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.120
How did it end up with you?

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.870
Your Highness,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:32.510
Yun Qing quietly left

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.080
the camp early this morning.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.200
He left this dagger

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.080
with a message for Your Highness,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.910
that he intends to kill someone
on Your Highness's behalf,

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.410
and that he's failed you in this life

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.240
and wasted your cultivation.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.100
Is he leaving the Feng Battalion?

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.400
You may leave.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.320
Yes.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:51.670
What does he mean?

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.960
Who does he want to kill?

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.160
You said this morning

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.520
that Xia Jingshi is arriving in Yujing?

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.500
Yes, he's arriving today.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.910
[Yujing Border]

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.210
He intends to kill Xia Jingshi?

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.270
Xia Jingshi is coming for
the marriage alliance.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.600
If he dies in Yujing,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.980
Susha will be accused

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.440
of betrayal and dishonor,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.400
and Yun Qing's crime will be unforgivable.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.150
Please, Your Highness, save Yun Qing.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.720
Yun Qing is completely loyal
to Your Highness.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.390
He knows that Your Highness

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.910
cannot kill Xia Jingshi yourself,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.570
so he wants to kill him for you.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.980
How can he be so foolish?

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.030
If he does this,

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.720
isn't he just giving up

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.790
all his hard-earned military achievements

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.250
and his promising future?

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.370
Yun Qing is your sworn brother,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.790
but he's also like a little brother to me.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.520
Don't worry.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.040
I'll definitely find a way to stop him.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.720
But...

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.060
Your Highness,

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.530
Yun Qing is the best archer

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.620
in our battalion,

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.990
and he knows the terrain well.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.520
If he wants to kill Xia Jingshi,
I'm afraid...

00:14:59.200 --> 00:14:59.730
Besides,

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.110
where would we even find him?

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.070
Why should I help you?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.630
As long as you help me find him,

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.960
you can name your price.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.670
I have no price to name,

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.330
and I don't have that ability.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.080
Although you've lost

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.540
the strength to draw a bow,

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.360
you still have an archer's keen eyes

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.660
and experience.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.870
Well, I'm flattered.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.000
Yun Qing doesn't know

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.790
Xia Jingshi's exact time of arrival
in Yujing,

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.030
so he can only lie in wait

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.520
for Xia Jingshi to appear.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.170
The most secure position to strike

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.700
would be near the city gate.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.120
The terrain outside the city gate
is too open,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.630
leaving Yun Qing nowhere to hide,

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.560
so he can only stay inside the gate.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.550
What you need to do is simple:

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.480
just tell me

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.580
if you were to assassinate Xia Jingshi,

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.380
what position would you choose?

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.790
If it's really as simple as you say,

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.390
then why bother coming to me?

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.360
I'm sure there are

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.720
plenty of skilled archers

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.270
in your army as well.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.550
You probably don't know that

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.510
Yun Qing is considered Susha's

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.840
most formidable archer.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.080
Ordinary archers can't even imagine

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.610
how formidable he truly is.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:03.600
Miss Yixiao,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.720
you are

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.840
the greatest archer in the world.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.910
Right now, only you can guess

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.710
what Yun Qing might be thinking.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.630
I'm not nearly as skilled as you say.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.160
It's not worth mentioning.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.800
See how good he is with words?

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.970
When asking for help,
one should act like it.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.020
Tell me, what are your conditions?

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.650
I can agree to three of them.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.280
That's not what you said just now.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.210
Fine.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.010
Five it is.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.620
"The entire Yujing City

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.390
is my territory.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.240
Everything's under my control."

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.750
First Prince,
you're truly impressive, huh?

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:51.690
If you're really that impressive,

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.690
how come you can't even find someone

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.090
when you want to?

Just over 50 paces.

That's enough.

Are you suggesting

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.940
Yun Qing would choose a closer position?

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:27.920
He knew you would

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.960
try to stop him,

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.240
so he deliberately took

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.340
a two-picul bow.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.270
But have you considered that

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.170
a two-picul bow is so large,

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.000
and bringing it to a crowded area

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.240
would make him too conspicuous?

to deceive us,

he left his personal token.

This shows that after the assassination,

he doesn't want to implicate
the Feng Battalion,

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.200

he can make a lethal shot.

[Nan]

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.630
From this day on, join the Zhennan Army

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.410
and swear loyalty unto death
to His Highness!

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.150
Those who kill the people of Jinxiu,

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.440
I shall devour their flesh
and drink their blood!

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.750
Those who slay even one soldier
of the Zhennan Army,

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:31.960
I shall execute without mercy!

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.920

With this as my betrothal gift,

Heaven and earth as witness,
mountains and rivers as matchmakers,

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:42.000
I vow to stay by your side till death.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.200
Would you be willing

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.490
to marry me in your bridal finery?

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.520
What's wrong?

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.720
I will share life and death
with Your Highness!

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.120
This is a military order!

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:03.640
Protect His Highness!

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.900

I am Shen Wu, Minister of Rites.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.510
Prince of Zhennan, you've come from afar.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.440
The journey must have been tiring.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.080
Minister Shen, no need for
such formalities.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.480
Prince of Zhennan,
please follow me to the carriage.

please follow the ceremonial officer

to the post station to rest.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.240

Stop thinking about it.

Loosen your grip,

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.350
will you?

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.570
Alright?

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.220
No one here will hurt you.

Loosen your grip first.

Do you remember who I am?

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:20.600
Half a smile,

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:23.170
half a sneer—

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:24.950
just like you.

Simple folk customs indeed.

May you die a terrible death!

By order of our Emperor,

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.990
I have come to Susha

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.490
to marry Princess Xiyang.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:14.690
Our Emperor

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.090
sincerely wishes

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.160
for lasting friendship
between our two kingdoms

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.290
and for the people to enjoy
a life of peace and stability.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.490
In times of war,

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:26.120
it's always the common people who suffer.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:26.720
I,

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.490
like the Emperor of Jinxiu,

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.070
wish for peace throughout the land.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.160
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.890
Princess Xiyang and I

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.510
will do everything to maintain peace
between our two kingdoms.

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:42.350
I was worried

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:44.480
about Xiyang marrying into a foreign land,

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.460
but today,

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.350
seeing your fine character,
Prince of Zhennan,

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.890
I feel much more at ease.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.970
In the future,

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.850
I hope you will treat each other
with respect

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:54.440
and live in harmony.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.680
Your Majesty,

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.200
I've obtained permission from our Emperor

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.110
to return all Susha warriors

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.850
we captured

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.400
in the Battle of Pingling,

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.510
hoping our kingdoms will maintain
friendly relations for centuries

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.770
and lasting peace throughout the world.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.400
It's thoughtful of you, Prince of Zhennan.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.530
When the time comes,

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.500
all Jinxiu prisoners

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.240
will be handed over to you

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.490
and return with you to Jinxiu.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.880
Now that the two kingdoms
have ceased hostilities and made peace,

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.520
Prince of Zhennan and Xiyang

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.920
deserve much credit.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.030
This way please, Prince of Zhennan.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.750
Your Majesty.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:03.450
Please sit.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.550
Bring some wine.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.070
Your Majesty,

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.590
it's not yet noon,
not suitable for drinking.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.590
I'm meeting my future son-in-law.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:18.730
Doesn't that deserve a drink?

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.630
As you command.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.780
Neither sitting nor bowing.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.000
If you marry my daughter,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.199
you'll be my junior.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.230
You're a prince, and I'm an emperor.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.360
There's a distinction
between ruler and subject.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.159
Shouldn't you

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.530
bow to me?

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.390
Your Majesty,

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.320
let tea serve as my drink.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.750
Are you trying to treat me as your equal?

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.050
When I marry the princess,

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.320
I'll observe the proper etiquette
between father and son-in-law.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.980
Why not wait until the wine's served?

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.590
To express my sincerity,

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:37.510
whether it's tea or wine,

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.420
what difference does it make?

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.180
Try this.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.110
How is it?

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.920
Princess Xiyang has a sweet tooth.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.630
How do you know

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.910
these are Xiyang's favorite pastries?

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.190
Your Majesty is a man of great talent
and broad vision,

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.670
with the world in your heart.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:15.320
Recommending such sweet pastries to me

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.740
certainly isn't because

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.380
you like them yourself.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.670
I suppose

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.670
Your Majesty wants to test

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.000
if Princess Xiyang and I

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.360
have compatible tastes,

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:24.910
right?

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.320
Prince of Zhennan,
you're quite perceptive.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.570
The pastries you just had

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.440
were created by Xiyang herself

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.370
when she was only seven years old.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.000
Her mother said that as a princess,

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.360
she shouldn't be cooking herself

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.040
and should let the royal chefs handle it.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.230
But Xiyang insisted

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.280
that these pastries

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.490
were meant for her family,

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.880
and she couldn't entrust them to others.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.580
Therefore,

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.040
in this entire world,

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.960
only she and her two brothers,

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.400
myself, and the Empress have tasted them.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.050
And now, you're the sixth.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.710
It's truly enviable

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.420
to hear Your Majesty speak

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.110
so fondly of family matters.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.170
I know that

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.320
although you and the Emperor of Jinxiu

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.320
are brothers, you're not close.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.030
My children are different.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.970
Though they were not born
of the same mother,

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.440
their bond as siblings

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.540
is deep and strong,

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:19.480
second to none.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.460
That's wonderful.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:22.840
And?

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.840
The marriage between you and Xiyang

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.630
was Xiyang's own choice.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.530
I know that

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:34.510
others say Susha was defeated

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.660
and could only buy a few years of peace

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.930
by marrying off a princess.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.510
They are wrong.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.800
If it weren't for
Xiyang's affection for you,

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.630
I would never

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.070
trade my beloved daughter's
lifelong happiness

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.880
for a few years of peace in Susha.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.780
What I mean is

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:58.800
I

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:01.710
will absolutely not allow Jinxiu
to fail Xiyang.

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:02.710
In this marriage,

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.190
what I want is my daughter's

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:05.710
happiness and well-being.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.110
I

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.280
will not give you

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.140
any chance to disappoint Xiyang.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.230
Your Majesty speaks wisely.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.190
Kingdom affairs are kingdom affairs,

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.390
and family matters are family matters.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.760
I won't confuse the two.

I'm looking for Feng Suige.

Who do you think you are,

daring to call the First Prince
by his name?

Ning Fei from Jinxiu.

Get lost!

Is Fu Yixiao

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.680
here with you?

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.820
Get lost, get lost.

Feng Suige!

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.540
I know you're in there.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.800
Why are you making so much noise?

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.810
Yixiao needs to rest.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:15.850
Miss Ling,

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.110
it's me,

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:18.910
Ning Fei from Jinxiu.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:20.190
I don't care who you are.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.760
Stop making such a racket here.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.700
Yixiao is ill and needs rest.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.060
What's wrong with her?

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.280
If you're smart, you won't persist.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.030
Her affairs are none of your business.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.710
Just leave.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.320
Yixiao isn't seeing anyone.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.380
Take me to see her.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.550
I'll just take a look at her
from a distance,

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:37.480

Please step aside, Miss.

I don't want to hurt you.

Hand Yixiao over to me.

Greetings, Your Highness.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.800
Mr. Ma,

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.950
I'd like a word with Prince of Zhennan.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.290
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.510
Do you still remember me?

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.000
We've never met before,

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.850
so how could I remember you?

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.020
So you really don't remember.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.840
Three years ago,

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:08.490
at the border between Jinxiu and Susha,

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.400
on the desert.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.840
Prince of Zhennan, you should know that

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.590
my father is a warrior emperor

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.590
who founded our kingdom
through military might,

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.650
and my brother is the commander of
Susha's three armies,

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:19.670
so I can be considered
coming from a military family.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.030
Given my background,

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.480
I also thought about achieving glory

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.630
on the battlefield

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.840
like my father and brother did.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.590
It's not that I enjoy war.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:29.190
I just believe

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:30.710
that as a princess,

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.550
I should do something
to serve our kingdom.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.890
You don't have to go to war
to serve your kingdom.

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.020
You have your own duties as a princess.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.260
What you just said

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.630
is exactly the same as

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:43.360
what my brother said back then.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.630
Three years ago,

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.920
I wanted to follow my brother to battle,

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.150
but he wouldn't allow it.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:49.800
But I was young and impetuous then,

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.280
and somehow found the courage

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.070
to secretly acquire a suit of armor.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:53.840
I pulled some strings,

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.030
snuck into the army,

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.150
and followed the troops into battle.

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:58.400
My brother

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.330
started from the bottom level

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.630
and made military achievements
step by step

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.110
until he became commander.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:05.600
I wanted to be like him.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.960
But on the second day of the campaign,

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.510
I ran into trouble.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.230
I had heard from my brother

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:12.480
that there was a shortcut

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.290
in the desert.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.380
To catch up with my brother,

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.360
I slipped away from my attendants,

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.190
intending to take that shortcut.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.280
Little did I know

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:23.080
I would be completely lost.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:28.000
What was even more desperate
than my dire situation was

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.930
that I was discovered by the enemy.

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:04.480
It's a woman.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:28.690
I don't kill women.

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.560

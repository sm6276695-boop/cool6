[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.000
[Episode 8]

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:45.850
Prince of Zhennan?

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.600
It was you who saved me that day,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.320
and you had also let me go.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.350
Princess Xiyang.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.640
I truly don't remember.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.039
I am your captive.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.310
Please be careful with your words.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.910
You are a precious princess,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.920
never my captive.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.530
But you've stolen my heart.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.710
From that day on, I finally
understood that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.310
women were never meant
for the battlefield.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.240
I cannot follow my Brother's path.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.710
From that day on,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.840
my heart

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.360
has been tied to yours.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.800
No,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.800
you're wrong.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.810
There was a woman

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.910
who not only went into battle,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.170
but became a hero far surpassing any man.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.280
Don't cry, don't cry

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.050
I've shared so much with you,

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.079
I'll remember the way home

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.170
yet you thinking of another woman.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.550
Do you know that

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.710
in order to marry you,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.460
I even offended my Brother?

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.400
Don't cry

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.730
I just wanted to say that

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.120
women can also go to war.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.590
I'll find my way home

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.850
What is her name?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.200
General of Jinxiu,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.850
Fu Yixiao.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.240
Princess Xiyang,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.970
I'll take my leave.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.720
Fu Yixiao?

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.800
It's the Prince of Zhennan from Jinxiu

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.110
and our First Prince.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.290
Yes.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.220
These two are sworn enemies.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.590
Prince of Zhennan.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.870
We meet again.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.910
Yes.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.890
We've met at

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.410
the Battle of Pingling.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.000
We were so close to success.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.860
If Pingling City had fallen then,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.850
you would now be

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.290
my prisoner.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.600
What a pity.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.310
Indeed a pity.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.480
A pity that arrow

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.110
lacked just a bit more force.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.040
Otherwise, Yujing City today

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.580
wouldn't be celebrating,

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.350
but mourning instead.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.130
You see,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.070
in this world, disappointments

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.180
are aplenty.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.760
Do you have Yixiao?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.870
Yixiao?

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.040
I happen to have a concubine

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.030
named Yixiao.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.110
Could she be the one you speak of?

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.550
Concubine?

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.620
I found her by the roadside

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.680
and took her in out of pity.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.840
She was deeply grateful

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.680
and wants to repay me with her life.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.280
So, I graciously accepted her
as my concubine.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.890
If you are still holding

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.070
a grudge for that arrow shot

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.720
during the Battle of Pingling,

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.060
just blame it on me.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.730
I ordered her to shoot you.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.350
None of this is her fault.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.760
The score between her and me,

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.850
you want me to settle it with you?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.190
On what grounds?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.360
I once swore

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.790
to protect her for life.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.800
You claim to be protecting her.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.600
But when her life was hanging by a thread,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.160
where were you?

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.000
When she was severely wounded
and being hunted,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.300
where were you then?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.010
None of your business.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.800
You've already forgotten what I just said.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.070
She belongs to my household,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.480
so of course it concerns me.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.970
Yixiao is one of

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.120
the Three Heroes of Jinxiu under my command,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.390
my right-hand woman,

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:44.870
someone I cannot afford to lose.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.920
I ask you, the First Prince,
to do me this favor

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.050
and return her to me.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.500
If she's that important,

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.300
then it seems

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.960
I definitely can't give you what you want.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.600
Then what would it take for you

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.880
to give her back to me?

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.200
Xia Jingshi,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.920
have you forgotten that

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.420
Fu Yixiao is a person,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.420
not some stray cat or dog?

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.190
If she wishes to leave,
I don't need to return her,

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.110
nor do I need to release her.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.750
She'll leave of her own accord.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.940
Does she know I've come to Susha?

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.620
Of course.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.650
She knows you're here

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.770
to marry my sister.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.280
Let's go back.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.740
Oh, by the way,

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.830
I can return the other one of

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.720
your Three Heroes of Jinxiu.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.120
He is...

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.600
What was his name again?

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.290
Ning Fei.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.630
The one named Ning Fei.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.800
You can take him back.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.480
I've already sent him to your inn

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.830
with just... three broken ribs.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.130
No need to thank me.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.000
Let's go back!

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.960
Slow down. Don't move.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.390
I'm fine,

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.240
don't worry.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.870
How many fingers am I holding up?

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.770
I can see clearly.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.130
No, let me check again.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.740
I told you I'm fine.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.860
Yes, you are.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.560
You have no idea

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.630
how terrifying you were just now,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.230
swinging your sword wildly.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.570
I just had a nightmare.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.920
I dreamt that I was
surrounded by many people.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.159
I fought desperately,

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:40.690
fighting with all my might,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.680
but I couldn't eliminate all my enemies.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.080
What happened back then?

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.720
How did you end up like this?

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.440
I saw them.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.790
Who?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.390
Those people from Jinxiu.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.850
[Nan]

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.130
Kill!

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:54.010
Kill!

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.159
-Kill!
-Kill!

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.270
Do you know someone

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.190
named Ning Fei?

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.770
I've heard the name,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.060
but I don't remember anyone.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.660
He claims to be your brother.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.040
He came looking for you earlier,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.770
but was beaten up by Feng Suige.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.190
His injuries are serious.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.450
With those injuries,

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.190
if treated by an incompetent doctor,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:11.870
he might suffer from

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.140
permanent damage.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.240
Xueying.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.720
Then please go

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.850
check on his wounds.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.650
You're recalling him?

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.000
I don't know yet if he's friend or foe.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.970
Regardless, help me

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.100
treat his injuries.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:24.970
What if...

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.120
he really is my good friend from before?

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.760
Alright.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.070
I'll do as you say.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.480
[Inn]

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.490
I'm done.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.770
Thank you, Miss Ling,

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.080
for coming to treat me personally.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.120
Appreciate the trouble.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.030
I couldn't care less about your affairs.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.650
I'm just doing someone a favor

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.850
and couldn't refuse.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.530
Doing someone a favor?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.000
Is it Yixiao?

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.870
Miss Ling.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.270
How is Yixiao doing?

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.150
Miss Ling!

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.150
You've broken three ribs.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.810
Although I've treated the wound
and applied medicine,

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.200
it's best you do not move around
for the next three days.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.670
Be careful not to let bone fragments
pierce your lungs or heart,

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.270
or there'll be no saving you.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.730
I'm fine.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.390
Miss Ling.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.350
Is Yixiao doing well?

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:34.740
No.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.990
Miss Ling.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.310
How is Yixiao doing now?

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.030
I hope you will tell me.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.410
She's lost her memory.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.150
Her left hand is injured too.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.120
She doesn't remember Jinxiu,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.520
or the Prince of Zhennan.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.120
Nor does she remember
the Three Heroes of Jinxiu.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.600
Lost her memory?

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.480
She remembers nothing?

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.320
What's wrong with you people?

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.100
Can't you even protect

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.160
your own comrade?

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.450
Miss Ling,

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.470
does Zhengnian Villa have any way

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.400
to treat Yixiao?

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.300
Whatever you need,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.200
Prince Zhennan's Mansion
will do our best to help.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.240
She is no longer

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.040
the Red-Clad General of Jinxiu.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.930
The prescription.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.630
Thank you.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:40.860
How are you?

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.320
Are you alright?

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:45.870
Fu Yixiao!

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.630
What happened on the city wall...

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:15.240
Thank you.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.990
I'm glad you're well.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:20.690
I heard...

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.120
you attacked my former comrade?

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.320
Yes.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.870
Why did you act

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.330
without any explanation?

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.750
I spared his miserable life

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.110
only because of you.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.400
If I don't punish him,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.120
wouldn't that mean

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.960
any Tom, Dick, or Harry

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.390
will dare to cause trouble
at my residence?

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.050
Besides, you belong to me now.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.030
Let's make things clear.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.230
I have never belonged to you.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.650
Still sharp-tongued as ever.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.730
You must be fine.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960
Didn't you spare my life and

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.320
seek my cooperation back then

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.120
precisely to help me

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.240
recover my memories quickly,

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.080
so I could uncover

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.600
who in Susha is
collaborating with the enemy?

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.240
So why did you stop me today?

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.770
I can wait while you slowly recall.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.840
I have plenty of patience.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.390
You may have patience,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.790
but I don't have time.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.550
After all, you're not the one
who lost your memory.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.870
You have no idea how I feel.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.550
I'm in a lot of agony now.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.960
My thoughts are completely chaotic.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.670
I need someone

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.120
to help me sort things out.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.150
I cannot let you see Xia Jingshi.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.150
I'm not asking for your permission.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.790
I'm not asking for it either.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.480
With Yixiao's strong-willed personality,

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.240
now that

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.630
she's lost

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.430
her most prized archery skills,

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.590
how agonizing must it be for her?

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:51.810
Your Highness,

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.230
please give the order.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.750
Even if we have to
turn Yujing City upside down,

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.200
we must rescue Yixiao.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.520
Your wounds haven't healed,
but you've forgotten the pain.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.150
Is this the time to be impulsive?

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.970
Don't forget

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.150
what we're here for.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.000
Is Yixiao more important than
the marriage alliance?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.790
If something goes wrong with
the marriage alliance,

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:06.770
the Emperor of Shengjing City,

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.150
will immediately strip
His Highness of military power.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.950
Don't you understand even that?

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.540
Then...

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.760
what do you suggest we do?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.000
When I think about Yixiao

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.360
being in the tiger's den,

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.000
I'm practically on pins and needles.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.270
Enough.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.870
How can I possibly stay calm?

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.040
I'm considering...

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.000
bringing the matter of rescuing Yixiao

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.970
to the public.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.720
Your Highness, you mean...

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.150
you want to make the Emperor of Susha
order her release?

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.790
Yes.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.270
If the two states enter
the marriage alliance,

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.840
it's only right they release our people.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.640
But we've just arrived in Susha.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.600
Making demands for her release now

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.030
will inevitably invite speculation around

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.960
Your Highness's true intentions

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.390
behind your early arrival.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.080
Your Highness's early arrival

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.870
can be for the marriage alliance,

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.600
or for peace between our nations,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.720
or to demonstrate Jinxiu's sincerity,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.380
but it absolutely

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.110
cannot be for a female general.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.430
That's right.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.030
We mustn't rush this matter.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.550
I will find an opportunity

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.480
to request her release from Susha.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.530
Now that Yixiao

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.990
has lost all her memories,

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.200
why would she stay

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.400
by Feng Suige's side?

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.630
She must have her reasons.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:14.970
We need to find a way

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.110
to see her.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.600
There was a woman

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.840
who not only went into battle,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.970
but became a hero surpassing many men.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.480
What is her name?

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.640
General of Jinxiu,

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.000
Fu Yixiao.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.950
Try this.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.670
I had someone prepare it.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.360
We've finally

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.890
put aside our differences,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.220
and agreed to work together

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.420
to uncover the truth.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.140
Nothing and no one

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.360
should ever

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.780
come between us.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.490
I know you want to see Xia Jingshi

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.240
because you're hoping his account

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:28.750
might help you

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.350
recover your memory faster.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.110
But you need to understand

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.200
that any memory someone shares with you

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.540
may not be the truth.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.920
I didn't want you to see them

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:39.880
for no other reason than

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.160
I was afraid you might be manipulated.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.810
I can judge for myself.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.210
I won't be easily manipulated.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.840
I understand how you feel right now.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.360
How could you possibly understand?

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.320
You're not the one who lost your memory.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.030
I just want you

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.230
to respect my wishes.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.810
At the Zhennan Pass of Jinxiu,

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:58.600
those who have both

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.670
the ability and opportunity to harm you

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:00.590
are very few.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.930
This includes Xia Jingshi,

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:03.790
as well as

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:04.720
your two brothers from

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.240
the Three Heroes of Jinxiu.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:06.960
I don't want

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.000
you to trust anyone blindly.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.660
So I should trust you instead?

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.860
When I agreed to work with you,

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.150
you promised me

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.240
I could leave anytime I wanted.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.320
But now I simply want

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.790
to meet with Xia Jingshi

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.360
in order to understand my circumstances,

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.320
yet you're doing everything to stop me.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.380
How can I trust you?

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.210
Since we're partners,

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.720
we share the same goal.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.390
How could I possibly hurt you?

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:30.510
If we're partners,

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.930
then we're equals.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.820
I'm not your subordinate,

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.140
and you have no right to decide for me.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.670
Are you worried that

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:38.870
if I meet Xia Jingshi,

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:39.720
I'll recall past events

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.600
and be so eager to return him

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.510
that I'll eventually

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.910
stop cooperating with you?

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:43.960
If I go back,

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.960
your efforts will be in vain.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.750
So that's what you think of me.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.200
What else could it be?

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.160
No matter what you say,

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.550
I won't allow you

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.630
to see Xia Jingshi.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.800
Why do you think

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.000
His Highness won't let Miss Yixiao

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
meet Xia Jingshi?

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.440
Why should she meet him?

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:16.160
Why shouldn't she?

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.200
How would her meeting him

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.460
benefit His Highness?

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:21.079
What's the harm?

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.880
Do you know what it means

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.280
if she meets Xia Jingshi,

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:24.240
remembers something,

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.160
and regains her memory?

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.220
Do you understand the implications?

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:31.750
It means...

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.120
she'll recover her memory.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.590
Then wouldn't she remember

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.160
that His Highness

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.200
is her enemy?

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.790
What are you talking about?

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:40.880
Whether she recovers or not,

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.740
aren't we all her enemies anyway?

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.830
Have you ever seen His Highness

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:45.480
be this merciful

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.910
to any enemy before?

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.310
Well, no.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.210
Exactly.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.030
You've seen how His Highness's attitude

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:51.640
toward her

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.790
has changed these past few days.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.720
If at first

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.960
His Highness simply wanted to use her,

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.480
then

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.480
things just aren't that simple now.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.980
I'm afraid His Highness

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.640
wants her to recover her memory quickly,

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.960
yet fears she might remember everything.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.860
Why?

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.720
Because if she

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.110
truly remembers everything,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.910
she'll no longer be Miss Yixiao,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.730
but Fu Yixiao,
one of the Three Heroes of Jinxiu.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:11.830
She'll become the female general

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.090
who must fight His Highness to the death.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.110
You're overthinking.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.000
His Highness has always

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.880
prioritized the bigger picture.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.750
When will he ever

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:20.750
be caught up in these

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.810
romantic affairs?

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.440
I...

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.900
Even if this time,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.720
His Highness has indeed

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.200
been swept up by his feelings,

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.860
I don't think it's a bad thing.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.930
In my opinion,

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.950
Miss Yixiao is quite nice.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.510
Miss Yixiao?

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.480
Since when are you so polite?

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.640
Am I being polite?

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.370
Fu Yixiao.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.030
Yixiao.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:47.790
Miss Yixiao.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.610
It rolls off the tongue nicely.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:01.880
This waist token was

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.160
found on the corpse.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.350
This...

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.460
This is the undercover guards'
waist token.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.780
In Jinxiu,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.030
who can mobilize
the undercover guards?

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.610
His Highness can.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.390
Besides him,

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.080
who else can mobilize them?

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.160
Only Military Advisor Xiao.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.630
She actually revealed all this?

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.240
Today, as Prince of Zhennan
was entering the court,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.110
Princess Xiyang deliberately
went to see him.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.350
But when they spoke,

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.680
I didn't dare approach.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.940
I just heard

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.070
the Princess mentioned

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.830
that the Prince of Zhennan

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:55.960
once saved her life.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.760
I never expected

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.720
they had such a history.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.920
I also heard from

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.620
the prisoner from Jinxiu that

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.200
the female general from Jinxiu
staying at First Prince's Residence

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.030
was saved by
the Prince of Zhennan years ago

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.400
and then recruited into his army.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.790
The two have faced
life and death together many times,

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.590
sharing an extraordinary bond.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.920
There are even rumors saying that

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:19.020
they are... secretly engaged.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.350
Nonsense!

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.400
Is the Princess aware of this?

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.490
I dare not say.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.790
When the Princess met
the Prince of Zhennan today,

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:28.550
it seems that he

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.110
had mentioned a female general.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.400
After returning to the palace,

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.960
the Princess became troubled,

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.750
and she hasn't been eating

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.110
for the entire day.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.350
Has she shown any signs of backing down?

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.110
Has she ever mentioned she's unwilling to
marry for alliance?

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.960
Not at all.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.510
The Princess is actually

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.830
rather excited about
the marriage alliance.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:44.790
She also has deep feelings

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.250
for the Prince of Zhennan.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.870
I understand.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:48.960
You may leave.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:49.960
Yes.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.100
Your Highness.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.130
Your Highness.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.510
The ceremonial procession from Jinxiu

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.240
is about to enter

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.180
Susha territory.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.000
In just a few days,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.330
they will reach Yujing.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.790
How many people have come?

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.000
Not counting the escorts,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.960
over a hundred people and
more than thirty carriages.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.240
He didn't dispatch troops from
Zhennan Pass to accompany him?

00:21:59.240 --> 00:21:59.990
No.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.560
I heard that the escorts

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.310
are all from

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.790
Prince Zhennan's Mansion in Pingling City.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.200
The Emperor of Jinxiu has also decreed

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.240
that on the day of the marriage alliance,

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.590
the main camp at Zhennan Pass
must retreat 30 miles.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.240
From every angle,

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.200
I think Jinxiu

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.350
is showing genuine sincerity

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.210
towards this marriage alliance.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.480
Before the procession enters the city,

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.290
ask them to hand in

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.200
a detailed list of all attendants.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.240
We must not be careless.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:21.680
Yes.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.200
Your left hand has only just

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.730
begun to show improvement.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.830
If you keep this up,

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.560
you'll truly become crippled.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.200
If it weren't for my left hand
being this weak,

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.160
do you really think you could have
trapped me here?

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.480
Are you that desperate to see him?

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:49.950
Yes.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.030
Have you ever considered

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.560
whether he wants to see you?

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.500
To be honest,

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.310
I actually hoped Xia Jingshi

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:57.960
would storm

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.350
the First Prince's Residence
for your sake.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.550
Then I could take the opportunity to end

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.720
his thoughts of marrying my sister.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.720
But he didn't.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.070
He's more composed than I imagined.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.680
What do you mean?

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:10.550
You aren't

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.810
that important to him.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.410
In other words,

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.160
if a general I had carefully trained,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.240
my good brother,

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.560
fell into enemy hands,

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:19.920
I'm afraid I could hardly match

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.760
his profound sense of duty.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.770
You're trying to sow discord.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.540
He doesn't deserve it.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.720
[Zhengnian Hall]

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.400
Headache?

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:43.760
Let's go inside.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:46.750
All's good.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.550
You'll be fine after taking the medicine.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:48.960
Thank you.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.490
Okay.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:50.590
Go back and have a good rest.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.650
Thank you, Doctor.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.300
Hold still.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.260
If you dare spit it out,

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.270
I'll make you drink

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.930
this entire bowl of medicine.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:10.710
She's doing it on purpose.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.590
She's definitely doing it on purpose.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.240
What did he say?

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:13.680
What did he say?

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.510
Who's doing what on purpose?

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.480
Young Mistress Ling,

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.740
please don't mind him.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.440
Bear with it.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.400
Hang in there.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.870
It'll be over soon.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.240
Hang in there.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:42.840
Done.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.830
Change the dressing every three days.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.750
Don't move around while
you're on bed rest.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.480
Bone and tendon injuries

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.780
aren't easy to heal.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:49.670
If you

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:50.830
don't follow my instructions,

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.000
don't come looking for me again.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.730
Understood.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.570
We'll strictly follow your medical advice.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.940
Alright,

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.060
you may go now.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.960
Pay for the medicine at the front hall.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.350
As for the consultation fee...

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.550
I'll waive it for you.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.510
This way.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.120
Young Mistress Ling.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:11.750
May I have a word with you?

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.660
You want to see Yixiao?

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.270
No way.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.350
Although I can enter

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:20.350
Feng Suige's residence,

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.030
I can't just

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.350
bring you in as I please.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.400
We just want to see her—

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.000
No need for all that trouble.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.350
This bamboo whistle

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.350
was the token we used to contact Yixiao

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.210
back in the day.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.530
But now that she had lost
all her memories,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.200
this method probably

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.370
won't work anymore.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.810
But no matter what danger she is in,

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.830
as long as she blows this bamboo whistle,

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.640
we brothers will come without hesitation,

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.790
even if it means walking through

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.850
mountains of knives and seas of fire.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.170
Please, Young Mistress Ling.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.530
Alright.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.070
I'll pass this bamboo whistle

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.110
to her for you.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.270
Why don't you just

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.400
bring her here then?

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.110
We really want to see her again.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.640
His Highness

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.480
also wants to see her as soon as possible.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.720
We truly are her brothers.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.480
I swear,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.880
if I'm not her brother...

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.520
This is Yujing City in Susha.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.680
This is Feng Suige's territory.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:15.160
Young Mistress Ling's willingness
to help us

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.760
is already a great kindness.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:18.030
Please.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:18.830
Please.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:21.400
Brother Ning Fei!

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.680
Brother Weiran!

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.400
Brother!

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.920
How come it's you guys?

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.050
Shunzi, Fang, Nine.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.310
-What brings you here?
-Brother Ning Fei.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:31.690
I brought them here.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.130
When they came to Zhengnian Villa

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:34.510
looking for Yixiao,

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.360
I saw how pitiful

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.620
the three of them were.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.210
Anyway, it's

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.340
a long story.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.090
Brother Weiran,

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.310
we've found our Master.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.440
We'll listen to you.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:45.920
Do you know how dangerous

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.800
it is here?

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.910
If anything happened to you,

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.000
how would I explain to your Master?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.750
Alright.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.110
-Let me have a look.
-Shunzi.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.880
-Brother Ning Fei.
-Nine.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.480
Brother Weiran.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.480
Brother Ning Fei.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.310
As long as you guys are okay.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.680
All's good now.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.830
You've grown taller.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.630
Were you good to Sister Xueying?

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:06.350
When they came to Zhengnian Villa

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.280
looking for you,

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:08.880
you were in the medical pool
at the back mountain.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.750
I didn't tell them

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:10.680
your whereabouts

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.740
because you were wounded by an arrow,

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.510
and anyone who could hurt you
within five paces

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.170
must be someone you knew well.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.450
They claimed to be your brothers,

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.840
so I...

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.600
You did the right thing,

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.050
Don't blame yourself.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.470
Do you remember them now?

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.010
I can't say I remember,

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.890
just some fragments of memory.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:29.720
When those images appear,

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:31.830
I feel as if I'm just

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.160
a spectator,

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.470
detached from it all.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.560
You speak with such sincerity,

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:37.550
but I only feel

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.210
a slight emotional response.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.510
I understand that

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.590
I seem to have

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.170
a very close bond with them.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.600
But this feeling is like

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:46.450
flowers in a mirror

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:47.950
and moon in the water.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:50.550
What about the Prince of Zhennan,
Xia Jingshi?

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.310
You said when you met him
at the city gate,

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.640
it seemed as though a flood of emotions

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.350
welled up from the depths of your memory.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.750
Then why don't you go see him?

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.160
Perhaps he is the key

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.800
to unlocking your memories.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:01.040
I thought so too.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.200
But Feng Suige

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.910
wouldn't let me see him.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.590
Just because he wouldn't let you go,
so you won't go?

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.060
That's not like you.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:10.310
This is a great opportunity

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.580
for you to slip away.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:12.720
Don't tell me you really plan

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.270
to continue working

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.310
with Feng Suige?

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.200
I feel that

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.960
whether or not you want to
return to Jinxiu,

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.070
you should take this chance

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.600
to get away from Feng Suige.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.610
This place of his

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.980
isn't exactly a good place after all.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.030
Although he's not exactly a good person,

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:26.810
and he doesn't really

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.350
have good intentions toward me,

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.640
when I was in trouble,

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.980
he did protect me.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.650
Besides,

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.550
I agreed to cooperate with him.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.130
If I go back on my word now,

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.440
it would seem somewhat dishonorable.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.550
You're talking about honor with him?

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.880
At a time like this?

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.070
I've always kept my affairs separate.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.310
I always repay my debts,

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.030
and I always collect what's owed to me.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.690
I need to help him at least once

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.070
before I can leave with
a clear conscience.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.070
What should we do then?

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.820
If Feng Suige

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.880
refuses to let you see him,

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.610
wouldn't you be

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:55.870
trapped here forever?

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.040
Here's the plan.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.940
Ask Ning Fei to send a message
to Xia Jingshi.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.480
You guys want to meet at my place?

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.700
Just say I'm going to see the kids.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.720
Feng Suige's people will definitely be watching,

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.480
but they'll only guard the front entrance.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.160
At that time,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.830
have Xia Jingshi come in
through the back door.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.310
I must see him as soon as possible

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.970
and get all the answers I need.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.490
When?

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.510
No time like the present,

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.770
so let's make it today.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.030
Did Yixiao really send a message

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.030
wanting to see us?

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:27.830
That's right.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.550
Thankfully we have
Young Mistress Ling's help,

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.720
otherwise we'd have no idea

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.120
when we could see Yixiao.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.050
I knew Yixiao

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:34.530
wouldn't forget about us.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:36.880
We are so thrilled

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.480
we forgot her Moon-Shooting Bow.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.880
Didn't I just tell you we must

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.350
avoid making a spectacle out of
meeting Yixiao?

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.480
So why bring the Moon-Shooting Bow?

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.110
What if Yixiao wants to see it?

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.750
Enough.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:46.550
When we meet Yixiao later,

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.160
both of you

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.640
absolutely must not tell her

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.970
too much about the past.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.750
Miss Ling specifically instructed that

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:52.960
she shouldn't be upset.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.690
Understood?

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:54.200
Yes.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:54.920
Yes.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:56.560
Let's go.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.510
This servant greets Your Highness.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.160
The Empress

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.750
is hosting a banquet in the
Imperial Garden today

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.160
and wishes to have a chat
with Your Highness.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.890
She sent me to escort you there.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.410
Today?

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.610
Is Your Highness unavailable?

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:21.350
No.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.260
I'll accept the order.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:31.480
I...

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:33.440
Wait for me here.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:34.920
Yes.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.350
[Zhengnian Hall]

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.950
I still feel a little unwell.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.030
Be careful.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:30:59.790
Master,

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.300
let me pour you some tea.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:02.350
I'll do it myself.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.350
We agreed to meet here

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.420
after two hours.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.620
Why haven't they shown up yet

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.950
after all this waiting?

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.260
Here, Shunzi.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.730
Thank you.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.750
Sister, I want some too.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.110
Here.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.910
Here, Fang.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:29.340
Sister.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:30.400
Don't worry.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.720
How about I send someone

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.720
to the inn to ask?

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:33.900
It's fine,

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:35.400
let's wait a bit longer.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.800
They're here.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:41.080
Brother Ning Fei.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.960
-Brother Ning Fei!
-Brother Ning Fei!

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.090
-Brother Ning Fei!
-Brother Ning Fei!

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.380
This courtyard is nice.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.000
Full of birdsong and flowers,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.310
and quite secluded.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:13.750
Where is he?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.460
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:20.290
No, Your Highness.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.030
He...

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.700
For your father's sake,

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.550
just this once.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:29.690
It was my idea,

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:30.830
she had nothing to do with it.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.090
Direct any anger at me.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:33.200
Xueying,

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.310
take the children inside quickly.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.440
Shunzi, Fang, Nine.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.130
Let's go.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:38.590
Let's go.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.510
Since we're working together,

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:44.830
we are partners.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.790
It's perfectly normal for you
to get temperamental.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.720
But since you're so eager to see him,

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.400
it would make me seem petty

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.230
if I keep trying to stop you.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.610
So go ahead and meet,

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.210
but in my presence,

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.400
where both you can speak freely.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.960
Xiyang lost her birth mother
at a young age,

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.840
so I raised her myself.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.960
Though she's not my biological daughter,

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.020
I've always treated her as my own.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.440
Throughout her life,

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.590
I've never let her suffer
the slightest injustice.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.990
Just thinking about her marrying far away,

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:22.050
my heart just feels...

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:23.100
indescribable.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.310
I feel empty somewhere.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.350
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.890
When Princess Xiya marries into Jinxiu,

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:30.750
she will not suffer

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:31.680
any grievances whatsoever.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.510
That's good.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.720
Then I can entrust my daughter

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.120
to you with peace of mind.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.720
I may be saying all of this to you,

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.030
but Prince of Zhennan,

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.560
please don't take offense.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.410
I wouldn't dare.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:46.570
By the way,

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.020
I heard that there's a female general

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.880
in your army.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:58.640
Yes,

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:00.790
her name is Fu Yixiao.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.400
Is she that lady staying as a guest

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.460
at the residence of our First Prince?

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.030
Battlefields

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.040
have always been the domain of men.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.480
How did you come to have

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.610
a woman in your army?

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.710
It's a long story.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.800
She was an orphan from childhood,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.000
so she suffered a lot.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.679
Later she came to my army,

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.730
and over time,

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.679
she developed

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.570
remarkable battlefield skills.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.330
It seems like

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:26.699
there must be a profound bond

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:28.030
between you two.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.280
I am the Commander-in-Chief
of Zhennan Pass,

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.480
and she is my general.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.040
In our army,

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.280
even the common soldiers

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.760
share a bond forged in life and death.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.840
Without such loyalty,

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.710
how could anyone dare to

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.310
turn their back to a comrade?

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.120
I wonder if Your Majesty...

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.090
is referring to this kind of bond?

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.980
Is there anything else?

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.710
Beyond this?

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.040
Absolutely nothing.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.230
Perhaps I was just overthinking it.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.510
You should know that

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.120
Xiyang is His Majesty's precious jewel

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.460
and Susha's only princess.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.580
She also shares the same mother

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.110
with the First Prince of Susha.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.070
Even though this marriage alliance
is a matter of great importance

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.230
and concerns the welfare of
both countries,

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.010
if Xiyang herself refuses,

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.000
no one

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.510
can force her to comply.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.030
She has lived sheltered in the palace,

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.320
knowing little of the outside world.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.400
I've protected her too well
since childhood.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.930
Even the slightest trigger

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.100
might cause her to change her mind.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.990
Thank you for your guidance, Your Majesty.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.610
This is hardly guidance.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.070
I simply wanted to meet

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.670
my future son-in-law today.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.410
A good match is hard to find.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:43.750
Prince of Zhennan,

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.090
you must treasure this opportunity.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.080
It was you who interfered, wasn't it?

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.190
Such underhanded tactics

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.380
are exactly what I'd expect from you.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:17.580
Feng Suige.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.400
Only now do I see clearly that

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.630
your definition of cooperation

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:21.730
is just a different way

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:23.260
to imprison me by your side.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.350
Not only do you want to

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:25.360
uncover the truth from me,

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.920
you want me to submit to you.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.920
Otherwise you wouldn't
repeatedly stand in my way.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.110
You show me kindness on one hand

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:32.510
to make me feel indebted,

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:34.000
yet you control me on the other

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.630
and claim it's for my own good.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.550
But in reality, they're all at
your disposal.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:38.240
I'm nothing more than

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.370
a pawn in your game.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:41.360
But you seem to have forgotten that

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.490
I, Fu Yixiao, have never been

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:43.880
someone who submits to others.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.590
I didn't want to

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:45.280
fall out with you before

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.000
because I was mindful of

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
what you've done for me.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.070
For every kindness shown to me,

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:49.320
I will repay it a hundredfold.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.290
You must have figured

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:51.750
I wouldn't resist, right?

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.480
How foolish I was to have actually
thought for a moment

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.410
that you genuinely cared about me.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.630
I thought you were my friend.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.190
Looking back now, it's laughable.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.960
Fu Yixiao, you—

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.880
I'm going to see Xia Jingshi now.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.960
I'll kill anyone

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:18.280
who tries to stop me.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.880
How did this turn into an argument now?

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.320
Move!

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:28.160
Alright.

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.590
Go and have a look.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:33.480
Miss Yixiao.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.960
Your Highness, what's wrong?

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.190
S-Such a temper,

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.410
like she's gone mad.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.220
Your Highness.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.280
Where did she go?

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:46.960
Miss Yixiao

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.800
is going to the inn alone.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.800
Should we send someone to watch her?

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.470
Let her die.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.820
Your Highness.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:58.320
Yun Fang.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.120
Go watch her.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.030
Got it.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:11.450
Boss,

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:12.710
two more bowls of porridge, please.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.640
Coming right up!

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.520
[Inn]

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:25.710
Hurry up. Hurry up.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:26.880
Where is he?

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.580
Over there.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.860
Yixiao!

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.740
Yixiao!

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.800
Yixiao!

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:40.960
Yixiao!

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.610
You really are okay.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:46.460
I knew it.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.460
Yixiao.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.280
When we heard you wanted to see us,

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.990
Your Highness was so excited.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.960
But just as we were about to leave,

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.190
he was summoned to the palace
by Empress Zhuang.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.920
So...

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:56.210
Yixiao.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.860
I can't believe you actually

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.590
came to find us yourself.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:38:59.030
Yixiao,

00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.670
are you eating well and

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.880
sleeping well over there?

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.140
Don't get too excited.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.680
Yixiao is still injured.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:05.750
My bad,

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.000
I'm being too abrupt.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.050
Yixiao,

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:09.280
how's your injury?

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.510
I heard you were badly hurt.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.760
Let me see. Is it your arm?

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.480
Yixiao,

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.740
do you still recognize us?

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.450
I'm Ning Fei,

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.440
do you remember me?

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.070
You're Ning Fei.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:30.750
Then you must be Xiao Weiran.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.390
See?

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:34.590
You were overthinking it.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:35.230
How could Yixiao

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.160
not remember us?

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.920
Yixiao.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.630
Has Feng Suige given you a hard time?

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:39.320
A few days ago,

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.550
he was doing everything to keep us away.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:41.230
Today is the day

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.490
of our joyous reunion.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:43.970
Let's not mention him.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:47.670
Yixiao.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.800
If that Feng Suige bullies you,

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:51.430
just tell us

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.310
and I'll settle the score for you.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:54.190
Remember,

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.520
now that we're here,

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:57.080
you have someone to rely on.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.180
Thank you, Ning Fei.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.800
Why are you thanking me?

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.360
-Yeah.
-She…

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.690
Why be so polite with us?

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.220
Your Highness is back.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:13.450

Let's go.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.510

Yixiao.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.230
Yixiao.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:41.280
I had planned to go and meet you,

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.510
but something came up.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:43.150
I know.

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.430
They told me everything.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.430
Why didn't you come back?

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.800
I...

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.810
I knew you weren't dead.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.190
I believed you would find

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.990
your way home.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.960
But why wouldn't you return?

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:57.360
Yixiao, do you know?

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.510
I've been looking for you all along.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:00.970
I've been waiting for you.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.800
I was afraid you'd never return.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.840
I...

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.290
I don't remember anything.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.290
You don't even remember me?

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.300
Then what do you remember?

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:15.200
Ning Fei?

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.210
Xiao Weiran?

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.570
Everything about Pingling City,

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.170
you don't remember any of it?

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.800
Fang and Shunzi told me

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:24.960
a bit about the past.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.590
Feng Suige told me some stories

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:27.920
about the battlefield.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:29.320
Other than that...

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.850
You don't remember anything else?

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:35.190
Nothing at all?

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.920
What about everything

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.800
between us?

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.530
All that we've shared

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:41.240
through thick and thin,

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.840
you don't remember any of it?

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:46.800
Yixiao.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.760
Look at me.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.000
Look at my face.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.800
Tell me honestly,

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.110
do you remember?

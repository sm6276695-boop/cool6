CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.174
She's a deposed queen now.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:52.552
Say that again.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:53.636
What?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.138
Say it clearly.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.560
Oh, you mean, Deposed Queen Cha?

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.772
It's true though.

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.316
She's divorced and kicked out.
That's a deposed queen.

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.110
Are you okay, though?

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.321
What if you get kicked out too?

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:15.658
You better side with your dad.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.202
If you side with your mom,

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.163
you'll go down with her.

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.003
What? What do you want?

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:30.715
Follow me.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:31.716
Let go.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.384
I said, follow me.

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:34.803
Are you crazy?

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:44.771
Stop!

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.447
Stop!

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.865
Stop it!

00:01:58.451 --> 00:01:59.285
Stop!

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:02.205
Let me go.

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:03.832
Let me go!

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.303
What are you guys doing?

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.276
He's bleeding a lot.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:35.446
You must be prepared to let the world
know about all your private life.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:41.411
Everything about you
and your daughter will be exposed.

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.011
I'm sorry.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.350
Do you think just an apology will cut it?

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.814
Is that all you have to say
after doing this to my child's face?

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.609
You all saw it was a one-sided beating.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.611
This is school violence.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.697
I'll report it to the school board
as well as the police.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.365
Ma'am, please calm down.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.702
How can I,
after what happened to my child?

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.622
I see.

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:30.460
Apparently, she thought she could do this
because her dad became president.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:34.088
I'll put her behind bars.
I'll make her pay for this at all costs.

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:35.757
I mean, in this day and age?

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:39.594
If you could trust us
and let us handle it, ma'am…

00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:43.014
This violence happened in the classroom
in broad daylight.

00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:45.141
How can I trust the school?

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.227
We'll form a disciplinary committee
right away.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.436
That's the procedure--

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.689
We have the video as proof.
What procedure do we need?

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.733
We don't need a disciplinary committee.

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:55.401
I want her expelled right away.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.363
Or I'll post this video online.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:06.579
Director.

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:18.132
Are you Seo-a's mother?

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.092
Yes.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:20.843
Can we have a talk?

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.111
LETTER OF APPRECIATION
CHA JEONG-YEON, CHA JIN-TAEK

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.530
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT
HASEONG CITY

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.386
It's my personal life!

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.096
It's my personal life!

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.988
GOODBYE, FIRST LADY

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:26.826
What are you doing? Have a seat.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.287
Is Longjing tea okay?

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:45.136
That's a lot of books in stock.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.558
Would you like to buy one?
I can sign the book too.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.561
I'm getting a little tired of it.

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:57.065
I deserve that much
after losing my seat in the Assembly.

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.528
I know.

00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:04.655
But I'm tired of it.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.994
I didn't just lose it.
It was taken away because of you.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.497
And because of that, my father…

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.254
Right, I killed him.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:39.023
Seo-a's mother will stop complaining.

00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:47.532
I promised her a position
on the parent committee.

00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:52.537
Why would you do that?

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.372
I'm her uncle.

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.458
I should look after my only niece.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.168
After all, we're family.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:04.382
I'm curious, though.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.093
I always try my best,

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:11.055
but it just won't taste
as good as when you make it.

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:15.309
Thanks.

00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:18.521
Seo-a's mother can't push you around
too much anyway.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.357
Who would make an enemy of the President?

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.401
She can only raise her voice at you

00:07:23.484 --> 00:07:25.445
because your husband
no longer has your back.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.786
I've been curious too.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.583
All the press started tearing me apart,

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:43.129
so I thought you'd show up
on all sorts of shows as a panelist.

00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:45.256
But you were too quiet.

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:51.012
I actually got quite a few calls
from Reporter Son.

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:52.638
But I didn't want to.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.433
I don't mind attacking you myself,

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.728
but seeing others attack you
made me feel bad.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.356
The power of blood, I guess.

00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:08.154
SECRETARY LEE BEOM-SEOK

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.996
It's him, right?

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:18.581
What?

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.625
The phone call just now.

00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:21.834
Wasn't it him?

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.252
Geez.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.090
You have good eyesight.
Even I didn't see it.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.515
What did you agree to get

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.642
in return for covering this up?

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.645
I'm not getting anything.

00:08:40.728 --> 00:08:44.023
Just like the position
you promised to Seo-a's mother.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.485
What did he promise to give you in return?

00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:48.778
Does that matter?

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:52.031
What matters is that
I'm on your side right now.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:56.327
So all you need to do is to settle it.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.245
What?

00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:00.081
I'm talking about the divorce.
Just settle it.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:04.335
If it ends up in court,
Seo-a's mother might bring this up again.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:13.427
Is this what he wants?

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:20.059
Did he ask you to use Ji-yu as a hostage
and make me surrender quietly?

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.478
Are you threatening me?

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.022
What? Do you have to put it that way?

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:26.941
What is this, then?

00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:28.568
What's wrong with keeping the peace?

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:31.237
Your only daughter's future
is on the line.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.782
School violence is
a serious issue these days.

00:09:34.865 --> 00:09:36.325
People who graduated a decade ago

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.744
come back with bribes
to change their records.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.913
A school violence record

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.498
can ruin one's life.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.590
I hear Ji-yu's going abroad?

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.971
You didn't know?

00:09:57.054 --> 00:09:59.849
She consulted with her homeroom teacher
as soon as school started.

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:05.354
Goodness. She's a smart kid,
just like her mom.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:08.107
Just like you when we adopted you
after your mom's death.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:10.359
My mom was shocked,

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:13.279
saying that you weren't
like a child. Remember?

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.745
Her study abroad hasn't been decided.

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:23.039
Hey, just divorce him and let her.

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:25.958
If you go with her to support her,
it'll look good too.

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.461
You can just forget
about the election and politics.

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.590
It looks like
you got something big in return.

00:10:32.673 --> 00:10:34.800
Watch your mouth.

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.886
And what's wrong with getting something?

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:40.765
Let's be honest.

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:43.017
Who do you think made Min-cheol president?

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.979
It all started with me getting him
that seat as an assemblyman for Haseong.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.105
"Min-cheol?"

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.023
Am I wrong?

00:10:49.106 --> 00:10:50.608
Maybe not as much as you,

00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:53.778
but I had quite a share
in him becoming president, too.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.490
Look.

00:10:57.573 --> 00:11:01.285
I can't keep sucking up
to these parents forever, you know.

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:05.748
I'm so done with these fools
who fuss over their kids.

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:15.800
Are you leaving already?

00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:18.219
We haven't had tea time like this
in a while. Stay longer.

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.890
I won't see you out.

00:11:22.973 --> 00:11:24.433
Say hi to Min-cheol for me.

00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:34.443
Parents are always worried sick
about their children.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:42.701
Hello?

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:44.328
Please wait a second.

00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:46.789
I'll put the president-elect on the phone.

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.127
How did it go?

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.628
How do you think?

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:54.463
I told you I got this.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:57.967
I'm sorry for asking for this favor.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.468
Don't say that.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.847
I'm the one bothering you
when you're busy with state matters.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.807
I'm sorry.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:11.355
I was just worried that
Ji-yu's mom might get her in trouble,

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.232
for trying to pull a few strings.

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.901
I asked for your help

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.154
to settle it amicably.

00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:21.782
I handled it quietly, so don't worry.

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:23.284
By the way,

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.287
how's the divorce going?

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.164
Oh, sorry.

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:31.542
It's a bit rude
to ask if it's going well, isn't it?

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:35.337
If the talk with Su-yeon doesn't go well,
I can step in.

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:37.923
Do you want my help?

00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:40.676
No.

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:42.803
You don't need to worry.

00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:47.349
Please just take good care
of Ji-yu's matter.

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.018
Ask me anytime.

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:50.478
That's what family is for.

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:52.229
We help each other out.

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:53.230
I've got to go.

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:02.531
You sure have bossed people around.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.951
When you were desperate,
you kept calling and calling,

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:08.913
but now that you're done,
you cut me off just like that.

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.917
Is it because you're president now?

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.961
The title really changed the man.

00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:30.601
Come in.

00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:41.737
Have a seat.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:58.462
A-ram.

00:13:59.046 --> 00:14:00.756
You should be a film director.

00:14:04.843 --> 00:14:07.304
That video you filmed with your phone,

00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:09.974
it was incredible.

00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:11.141
It's like an action movie.

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:13.936
Thank you.

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:16.772
Did you get your phone back?

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:18.482
Yes.

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.234
Did you delete the video?

00:14:20.317 --> 00:14:22.403
Yes, while my teacher was watching.

00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:24.029
Was it backed up to the cloud?

00:14:25.823 --> 00:14:27.199
That too…

00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:29.785
Be honest with me.

00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:34.832
Ji-yu.

00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:36.125
Hyun Ji-yu!

00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:39.336
Look at me.

00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:41.338
Are you okay?

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:42.756
Let's go see a doctor.

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:44.508
I'm good.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.218
Stop worrying about me.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:48.220
I can't.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.930
I can't when you're like this.

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:52.391
You didn't tell me
why you did that to Dad, either.

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:56.478
I'll stay out of your business,
so stay out of mine.

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:58.939
It'll be all over once I move abroad.

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:00.983
I'll quit this school anyway.

00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:09.241
Fine.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.743
You can go study abroad.

00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:12.328
If you leave this week,

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.496
you'll be there in time
for the new semester.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.334
You might as well go as soon as possible
and start adjusting.

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.543
Why?

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.838
So you can get rid of me
as soon as possible?

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.340
You go with the butler and--

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:27.051
Why am I the one to run
when you're the one who did wrong?

00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:29.386
You're the one
who brought up studying abroad.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.389
And you said
you'd do whatever you want after election.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.642
You even told the school about it.

00:15:40.564 --> 00:15:43.025
I'm just keeping my promise.

00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:45.110
And in return,

00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:47.488
I want you to promise me one thing.

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.449
You can make mistakes.

00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:54.662
But don't make the same mistake.

00:15:57.498 --> 00:15:58.540
Just promise me that.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:15:59.917
It wasn't a mistake.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.086
If it happens again, I'll fight her again.

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:04.338
What?

00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:05.589
I said I'll fight her.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:27.277
I wanted to take you out for dinner,
and all you wanted was tteokbokki?

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.238
Didn't you know?

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:31.407
This place gets a huge line
as soon as school's out.

00:16:32.032 --> 00:16:33.283
Look at you,

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:36.495
so happy with tteokbokki
after getting a nosebleed.

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:39.248
I hope Ji-yu is all right.

00:16:44.044 --> 00:16:45.421
This isn't fair.

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:50.092
When did you get so big?

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.011
I told you not to grow up so fast.

00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:54.888
I told you to grow slowly.
This isn't fair.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:17:00.811
If you grow up so fast, I'll be sad.

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:02.896
What are you saying?

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:11.113
Soon, you'll be as tall as your dad.

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:17.327
He'll be sad to see that.

00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:23.333
Should we take away the leftovers?

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.169
Let's do that.

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:29.923
Today, I want to have
a cozy time with my son.

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.094
Actually, should we go to the movies?

00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:36.555
Let's have tteokbokki in the theater.

00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:37.765
It'll be perfect.

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:40.142
What should we do after the movie?

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:43.187
An Gang-myeong,
we're going to have a blast today.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.481
-Don't you have to go back?
-No.

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.232
Because you made trouble.

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:50.235
I didn't make trouble.

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:51.945
I was trying to stop them.

00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:54.364
Fine.

00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:57.826
Now, see if there are any movies
to watch these days.

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:03.874
Could we have the leftover tteokbokki
and seaweed rolls packed to go?

00:18:03.957 --> 00:18:05.042
Sure.

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:08.712
Are you full?

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:11.173
Do you want some too?

00:18:12.132 --> 00:18:13.550
One second.

00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:22.226
Hello?

00:18:23.685 --> 00:18:26.105
Did Assemblywoman Bae accept
the luncheon tomorrow?

00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:29.233
It's work.

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:32.402
Sorry.

00:18:35.155 --> 00:18:36.698
I'll be right there.

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:39.701
You know the common pledges
pulled from the campaign booklets.

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:42.162
I'll talk to Assemblywoman Bae myself

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:43.914
so we can avoid miscommunication.

00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:50.587
You should go.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.384
Go. It's work.

00:18:56.885 --> 00:18:59.012
Let's watch the movie another time.

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:07.521
I promise.

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:42.848
BAE YEONG-SEON, HYUN MIN-CHEOL

00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:52.482
President-elect Hyun Min-cheol

00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:56.486
met with Representative Bae Yeong-seon
over a luncheon with lunch boxes.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.655
With public interest focused on

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:02.034
whether he can use this occasion
to recover the trust lost

00:20:02.117 --> 00:20:03.744
in the wake of his divorce case…

00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:06.788
Please look over here too.

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:17.090
You surprised me.

00:20:17.674 --> 00:20:20.469
You exposed the wiretapping.
You scored an own goal.

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:25.724
Anyway, you're the one who exposed it,

00:20:25.807 --> 00:20:28.477
so our gentlemen's agreement
still holds, right?

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.811
Of course.

00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:33.774
The drinking incident
Assemblywoman Bae had back in the US,

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:38.612
which we traded for the wiretapping case,
will never come to light.

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:43.283
We agreed to not mess
with personal matters.

00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:45.160
Watch your mouth.

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:48.497
Don't you see all the reporters here?

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.916
So both parties coexist for the people's…

00:20:50.999 --> 00:20:52.334
Don't you worry.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.711
By the way,

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.797
does Assemblywoman Bae know

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:01.051
that her closest ally has
something on her?

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:05.889
Oh, for goodness' sake.
What's with you today?

00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:09.601
Are you saying,
"If you don't like this, beat me"?

00:21:10.477 --> 00:21:13.021
Oh, come on. The election is over now.

00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:16.066
By the way,

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:18.527
who was the source?

00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:21.613
I'm talking about the wiretapping.

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.993
Park Chan-do.

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:29.037
Who's that?

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.164
The man who Chairman Cha kept
by Cha Su-yeon's side

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:33.458
for over a decade as a watcher,
after adopting her.

00:21:34.876 --> 00:21:36.128
As soon as the election began,

00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:39.172
Park Chan-do wanted to meet me,
saying he knew something.

00:21:40.215 --> 00:21:43.844
He said he wiretapped Hyun Min-cheol
on Cha Su-yeon's orders.

00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:47.389
They say hatred makes you alike.

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:52.102
She had Park Chan-do,
the man who watched her,

00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:54.187
watch her husband.

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:55.605
Geez.

00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:59.693
Cha Su-yeon is just like her father.

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:04.114
Does Assemblywoman Bae know?

00:22:04.197 --> 00:22:06.366
Both you and I are shadows.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.160
Shadows have no mouths.

00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:10.787
So does she know or not?

00:22:11.955 --> 00:22:14.833
It means you don't need to know.

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:19.379
Reporters, thank you
for all your hard work day and night.

00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:21.590
Now, we'll move into a closed session

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:25.635
so the two of them can continue
their conversation comfortably over lunch.

00:22:32.893 --> 00:22:34.227
Oh, and one more thing.

00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:37.230
I'm hearing about you joining the cabinet,
but it's not over yet.

00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:41.401
I like that you're proactive,
but don't be cannon fodder.

00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:00.670
I assume you aren't here
just for some photo ops.

00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:06.176
Let me hear
about the urgent public welfare issue.

00:23:06.259 --> 00:23:09.387
Although what seems really urgent

00:23:10.013 --> 00:23:11.807
is you.

00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:14.351
You're right.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.979
I'm not the only one seeing it.
The entire country is.

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:19.231
They're watching it live.

00:23:22.025 --> 00:23:23.693
Would you be willing to help me

00:23:24.986 --> 00:23:26.279
as the prime minister?

00:23:30.033 --> 00:23:33.787
Why don't we put an end
to this five-year tug-of-war

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:34.996
that only hurts us both,

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.083
and become governing partners
beyond party lines?

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:42.379
Is this a proposal?

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:44.381
I'm liking this.

00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:48.885
Overcoming the turmoil
caused by your divorce

00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:51.346
with a political marriage?

00:23:52.305 --> 00:23:55.851
If you're thinking of using me as a pawn
to turn the tide and then discarding me,

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:56.893
I'm not interested.

00:23:58.645 --> 00:23:59.646
However,

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.191
if you can guarantee sincerity,

00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:04.985
I'll think about it.

00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:16.246
LIST OF PUBLIC INSTITUTION HEADS

00:24:16.329 --> 00:24:17.747
This is…

00:24:19.082 --> 00:24:22.419
I'm not going to make you
a puppet prime minister.

00:24:22.502 --> 00:24:25.547
I want us to fill in the blanks together.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.674
Will that be enough of a guarantee?

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:31.636
Are you suggesting
a national unity government?

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.721
That sounds good.

00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:34.222
So does grand coalition.

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.474
But let's not get hung up on the labels.

00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:39.227
I want us to be political partners

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.353
beyond that.

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:47.402
Give me some time.

00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:50.697
I'll discuss with the party.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.533
I'm not asking
Party for Peace and Freedom.

00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:54.618
I'm asking you.

00:24:56.494 --> 00:24:57.621
You're pretty rushed.

00:24:57.704 --> 00:25:00.373
I'm saying
there's no need to take a detour.

00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:08.131
Then my answer is…

00:25:10.091 --> 00:25:11.801
no.

00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:14.304
May I ask why?

00:25:14.387 --> 00:25:16.514
I'm a member of my party.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:21.519
I can't let the people
who want to be on the list

00:25:21.603 --> 00:25:23.271
and who are already on the list

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:25.106
shake up the party.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.609
If your intention is

00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:31.112
to rattle us
and divert criticism away from yourself,

00:25:32.405 --> 00:25:33.615
I'm disappointed.

00:25:34.741 --> 00:25:38.161
That's not the politics I learned.

00:25:46.628 --> 00:25:47.963
Then how about this?

00:25:52.008 --> 00:25:53.551
This is your campaign booklet.

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:58.056
Would you like to find a policy you want

00:25:58.848 --> 00:26:00.934
that we can work on together?

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.105
If there's any,
please help me as the prime minister.

00:26:05.188 --> 00:26:07.190
Only you can help me.

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:18.201
Do you mean this?

00:26:18.285 --> 00:26:19.452
Did you forget?

00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:22.038
Sincerity was my slogan.

00:26:24.124 --> 00:26:25.375
What do you

00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:29.671
want in return for all these benefits?

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.548
Is it really

00:26:32.132 --> 00:26:33.717
just me being the prime minister?

00:26:35.468 --> 00:26:37.387
I want you to pass the special act.

00:26:39.723 --> 00:26:42.225
If you back it
as your party's official stance,

00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:44.728
we can pass the bill
as early as this week.

00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:49.482
So it wasn't just a media spin.

00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:51.151
I told you.

00:26:51.234 --> 00:26:52.360
I'm sincere.

00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:56.698
There are so many politicians
tied to Chairman Yang.

00:26:56.781 --> 00:27:01.411
He's been spreading money everywhere
for the past 20 years.

00:27:01.494 --> 00:27:03.580
Which is why we need the special act.

00:27:05.623 --> 00:27:09.002
As always, you're going at it head-on.

00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:13.089
At the TV debate during the campaign,

00:27:13.923 --> 00:27:17.469
I went after you
with the allegations against your wife,

00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:20.055
and you said
you couldn't abandon your wife.

00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:24.559
You were trying to protect your wife then,

00:27:24.642 --> 00:27:27.437
and now that you're elected
as the next president,

00:27:28.229 --> 00:27:29.898
you want to divorce her.

00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:33.193
Because of the Do Tae-hun Special Act.

00:27:33.276 --> 00:27:35.570
I entered politics

00:27:35.653 --> 00:27:36.988
because of Tae-hun.

00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:40.909
If he hadn't hurt his hand at work,

00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:44.746
and if his workplace injury hadn't been
unjustly turned into personal fault,

00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:48.166
I would never have become president.

00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:58.385
Now I see
why you were such tough competition.

00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:00.637
Now I see that.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.267
The way to win an election
is actually simple.

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:09.854
You either convince people
why you should win,

00:28:09.938 --> 00:28:13.274
or why your opponent shouldn't.

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:15.568
As you know,

00:28:15.652 --> 00:28:18.321
everyone insists that they should win,

00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:20.407
so that doesn't really work well.

00:28:21.282 --> 00:28:25.745
But convincing people
why your opponent shouldn't

00:28:25.829 --> 00:28:27.205
works pretty well still.

00:28:28.748 --> 00:28:33.128
Because only two-faced people
go into politics.

00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:40.343
Throw out a hint that
something's off about someone,

00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:42.053
and it's either true

00:28:42.137 --> 00:28:45.724
or it's impossible to prove it's not.

00:28:47.183 --> 00:28:48.476
But

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.105
with someone as transparent as you,

00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:53.398
things play out differently.

00:28:53.481 --> 00:28:55.608
Competing against someone like that,

00:28:57.402 --> 00:29:01.197
you start thinking that
it might not be that bad

00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:04.033
if he gets elected.

00:29:04.117 --> 00:29:09.247
In a warlike election
where it's kill or be killed,

00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:14.294
that's the last kind of mindset you want.

00:29:15.628 --> 00:29:17.505
I was the same.

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:18.923
However,

00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:20.425
I changed my mind.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.678
Is it

00:29:23.762 --> 00:29:27.807
because I wouldn't let go
of the suspicions about Cha Su-yeon?

00:29:27.891 --> 00:29:30.560
Since you said I was transparent,
I can't lie.

00:29:32.312 --> 00:29:34.439
I won't make excuses, either.

00:29:35.982 --> 00:29:37.567
I thought that was the last card

00:29:38.318 --> 00:29:40.570
I could play to turn the tide.

00:29:40.653 --> 00:29:41.738
It's all in the past.

00:29:41.821 --> 00:29:43.573
Now, shall we?

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:58.588
Next time, I'll visit your office.

00:29:58.671 --> 00:30:01.341
About why you chose me
as the prime minister…

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:04.344
Did the fact that I'm divorced

00:30:04.427 --> 00:30:06.304
play a positive or negative role?

00:30:06.387 --> 00:30:08.097
I wonder too

00:30:08.181 --> 00:30:11.309
if the divorce
of the presidential candidate

00:30:11.392 --> 00:30:13.353
played a positive or negative role.

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:15.897
After you.

00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:26.324
Today, I received a proposal
from the president-elect

00:30:26.407 --> 00:30:30.745
to jointly draw up the roadmap
for the next administration.

00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:33.498
I answered that
I would consider it positively.

00:30:34.374 --> 00:30:38.336
Though the specifics and procedures
will need working-level consultations,

00:30:38.419 --> 00:30:39.754
we've reached

00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:43.174
a formal agreement to pass the special act

00:30:43.258 --> 00:30:46.469
for investigating
the H Chemical fire incident,

00:30:46.553 --> 00:30:49.055
better known as the Do Tae-hun Act.

00:30:51.391 --> 00:30:52.767
They reached an agreement?

00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:56.688
In order to ensure swift passage
of the bill in this session,

00:30:56.771 --> 00:30:59.566
both parties will form
a special task force

00:30:59.649 --> 00:31:02.151
and do our utmost together.

00:31:02.986 --> 00:31:07.240
I will now take questions from the press.

00:31:08.157 --> 00:31:10.243
All right. What do you think?

00:31:10.326 --> 00:31:14.038
Lausanne in Switzerland has a similar
climate to ours this time of the year.

00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:16.291
You just take
some winter and spring clothes.

00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:20.879
Then I can visit you around May
and pick some summer clothes for you.

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:22.714
Will you do that?

00:31:25.675 --> 00:31:27.468
Did you forget anything?

00:31:30.346 --> 00:31:31.389
Look at that.

00:31:32.056 --> 00:31:33.558
I can't possibly forget anything.

00:31:33.641 --> 00:31:36.102
You're making such a big deal out of this.

00:31:36.185 --> 00:31:38.479
I'm going to study abroad, not emigrate.

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:40.315
I packed the minimum.

00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:42.859
It's like I'm emigrating.

00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:46.029
Right.

00:31:46.112 --> 00:31:47.906
I picked out some accessories too.

00:31:47.989 --> 00:31:51.075
You might need these for formal occasions.

00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:52.535
Right.

00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:56.080
I didn't see the necklace that I gave you.

00:31:56.164 --> 00:31:57.332
Did you pack it?

00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:58.541
No.

00:32:01.085 --> 00:32:02.128
Here.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.632
Now, open your eyes.

00:32:05.715 --> 00:32:07.258
Here you go.

00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:09.844
Congrats on your admission, Ji-yu.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.722
I told you to keep it for my graduation.

00:32:13.973 --> 00:32:15.850
I couldn't find it anywhere.

00:32:19.896 --> 00:32:21.147
You scared me.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.149
Maybe Lee Hwa-jin stole it?

00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:27.862
She was ransacking this place
without turning the lights on.

00:32:29.238 --> 00:32:30.865
Call her in immediately.

00:32:31.866 --> 00:32:32.825
Well…

00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:33.743
Ji-yu.

00:32:37.205 --> 00:32:39.415
What? She's suspicious.

00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:42.085
Tell her to come over.

00:32:42.752 --> 00:32:43.670
Well…

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:45.964
I'm sorry.

00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:48.716
She asked for a day off out of nowhere,

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.051
so I told her no.

00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:52.595
And she just quit.

00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:55.974
She's causing me so much trouble too.

00:32:57.433 --> 00:32:59.477
Ji-yu, I'll call her and ask

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.689
if she's seen the necklace. Okay?

00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.526
I'm sorry, Ms. Cha.

00:33:06.609 --> 00:33:08.361
I mean, First Lady.

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:19.998
It's Son Min-ju. Have you seen the video?

00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:21.874
Is it your daughter in the video?

00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:25.378
We got a video tip-off
saying Hyun Ji-yu is a school bully.

00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:27.505
Ms. Cha, please make a statement.

00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:33.678
SHOCKING! PRESIDENT-ELECT'S DAUGHTER
BEATING HER CLASSMATE!

00:33:39.976 --> 00:33:41.019
What?

00:33:41.978 --> 00:33:43.104
What is it?

00:33:48.735 --> 00:33:50.236
Grenade!

00:33:52.905 --> 00:33:55.241
What are you doing? I died because of you!

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:01.873
Stop!

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:04.792
What is this? Is this real?

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.335
Can't you tell?

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.807
This is nuts.

00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:24.729
I lost all my subscribers
because of the divorce and bugging,

00:34:24.812 --> 00:34:26.981
and the view count's plummeting.

00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:28.900
They're trying to end me for good.

00:34:28.983 --> 00:34:30.359
How will I pay the rent?

00:34:30.443 --> 00:34:32.236
This is driving me insane.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.534
Gosh, Cha Su-yeon's stalker is
foaming at her mouth again.

00:34:40.703 --> 00:34:43.998
Hey, I told you to stop calling me that.

00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:46.501
Don't insult my pure
and genuine affection for her.

00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:47.919
But then,

00:34:48.002 --> 00:34:49.879
the word "pure" doesn't suit you.

00:34:49.962 --> 00:34:52.423
-What?
-Just do an eating show.

00:34:53.466 --> 00:34:54.634
Are you kidding me?

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:57.053
By the way, where's Hwa-jin?

00:34:57.136 --> 00:34:58.596
She hasn't been around.

00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:00.348
She took on a short-term job.

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:01.682
A short-term job?

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:02.600
What is it?

00:35:02.683 --> 00:35:04.102
She won't tell me.

00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:05.353
She doesn't come home.

00:35:06.562 --> 00:35:07.605
That's suspicious.

00:35:07.688 --> 00:35:09.398
Yes, it's very suspicious.

00:35:10.566 --> 00:35:11.442
Hey.

00:35:11.984 --> 00:35:13.611
Aren't you worried about her?

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:16.697
MR. BUYER

00:35:17.406 --> 00:35:18.449
It's here.

00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:20.827
Just you wait.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:23.162
I'll pay your rent for you this month.

00:35:23.246 --> 00:35:25.832
Are you getting involved
in some trouble again?

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.046
Hello, sir.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.173
I was waiting for you to call.

00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:36.300
Of course.

00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:38.886
The thing is pretty big this month,

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:42.014
and you're the only one who can handle it.

00:35:42.098 --> 00:35:43.599
So I reached out to you.

00:35:44.767 --> 00:35:45.601
Did you

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.187
get an estimate?

00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:56.237
-How could she do this?
-My gosh.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.698
The view count has gone over a million.

00:36:01.742 --> 00:36:03.494
President-elect should step down.

00:36:03.578 --> 00:36:04.495
Punish her.

00:36:04.579 --> 00:36:05.830
She's like her parents.

00:36:05.913 --> 00:36:06.873
Who voted for Hyun?

00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:08.291
Cha tried to cover it up.

00:36:08.374 --> 00:36:10.334
Everything about that family was fake.

00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:12.712
THE 23RD PRESIDENTIAL
TRANSITION COMMITTEE

00:36:13.421 --> 00:36:15.882
-If you'll wait…
-I'll check as fast as we can…

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:19.594
I'll call back once I find out
what happened.

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:21.971
Please be patient. And don't worry.

00:36:24.348 --> 00:36:25.641
Yes.

00:36:27.894 --> 00:36:30.188
It's punishable by
the Act on Special Cases

00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:31.647
Concerning Sexual Crimes.

00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:33.858
They even spread illegally-filmed video.

00:36:33.941 --> 00:36:36.611
We have clear basis
to charge them with Network Act.

00:36:37.153 --> 00:36:38.446
I'll call you back soon.

00:36:38.529 --> 00:36:40.615
Secretary Shin. Have you met her?

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:43.910
It wasn't me.

00:36:43.993 --> 00:36:46.954
I just spoke to Ko A-ram,
the student who took the video.

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:51.000
The problem is,
she didn't upload the video.

00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:56.255
She claims that someone hacked
into her cloud and spread the video.

00:36:56.339 --> 00:36:59.133
Check if she suspects anyone.
I'll call back.

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:02.428
You don't believe me, teacher!

00:37:02.511 --> 00:37:03.346
I do.

00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:05.890
I've been saying the same thing.
You won't listen.

00:37:05.973 --> 00:37:10.144
-You took it, so you must've uploaded it.
-No, I think I was hacked.

00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:12.230
The hacker must've spread it.

00:37:12.313 --> 00:37:13.981
I understand what you're saying--

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:16.776
-No, you don't.
-I do.

00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:19.737
I've been explaining myself,
but you're doubting me.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.113
It really wasn't me.

00:37:22.114 --> 00:37:24.575
We're trying to reach the video uploader,

00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:25.952
but there's no response.

00:37:26.035 --> 00:37:28.621
This video is the only one
uploaded on the channel.

00:37:28.704 --> 00:37:31.540
They must've created the channel
to spread the video.

00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:32.833
Even if we take it down,

00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:35.920
the video has spread
and is being shared everywhere.

00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:39.590
Ask Lawyer Hwang
to find a way to take it down.

00:37:39.674 --> 00:37:41.884
The media is demanding an explanation.

00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:44.178
If the attacker in the video
really is Ji-yu.

00:37:44.887 --> 00:37:46.555
Do what you can to stall for time.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:54.272
Keeping silent is
the same as acknowledging it to be true.

00:37:54.355 --> 00:37:56.399
There's already a rumor that you used

00:37:56.482 --> 00:37:59.277
your influence to dismiss
the school violence committee.

00:38:01.487 --> 00:38:03.114
Ji-yu isn't the problem.

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:06.033
The real backlash this video will bring

00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:09.370
is whether you or your wife
pulled strings to cover it up.

00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:10.997
A simple case of school violence

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.499
could turn into an abuse of power issue.

00:38:16.252 --> 00:38:17.628
Let's respond preemptively.

00:38:21.048 --> 00:38:22.675
Make a national apology.

00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:24.593
Make an apology,

00:38:24.677 --> 00:38:28.514
but explain that it was a fight
between friends, not a bullying case,

00:38:28.597 --> 00:38:31.350
and back out
saying you did not pull any strings.

00:38:31.434 --> 00:38:35.563
That's the only way
to lessen the damage on our side.

00:38:37.606 --> 00:38:39.608
Set up a press conference. I'll attend.

00:38:39.692 --> 00:38:40.609
I understand.

00:38:40.693 --> 00:38:42.987
I'll write the apology
and choose the time.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:43.988
We must hurry.

00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:46.198
It concerns Ji-yu.

00:38:46.282 --> 00:38:47.742
We're racing against time.

00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:49.285
Now could be the golden hour.

00:38:49.368 --> 00:38:51.245
I decide when to hold the conference.

00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:52.955
You may leave now.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:13.976
Hello?

00:39:15.478 --> 00:39:16.687
Secretary Shin.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:20.733
You must answer my questions honestly.

00:39:24.153 --> 00:39:26.697
Are you involved in
the leakage of Ji-yu's video?

00:39:27.448 --> 00:39:30.326
It's different from tipping off
the divorce to the media.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.995
If you were involved in any way,

00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:35.122
you'll be held responsible.

00:39:36.248 --> 00:39:38.209
My daughter's future is at stake.

00:39:42.171 --> 00:39:43.297
It wasn't me.

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:46.967
I'll ask one last time.

00:39:48.427 --> 00:39:49.512
Are you sure?

00:39:51.305 --> 00:39:52.598
I didn't do it.

00:39:54.809 --> 00:39:55.935
What about Cha Jeong-yeon?

00:39:56.519 --> 00:39:58.312
He keeps repeating himself.

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:02.650
In return for covering it up, he demands
the Minister of Education position.

00:40:04.318 --> 00:40:05.736
That's nonsense.

00:40:06.612 --> 00:40:08.030
I'd expect no less from him.

00:40:08.656 --> 00:40:10.366
I'll meet him. Tell him to wait.

00:40:10.449 --> 00:40:11.659
You can't.

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:16.372
Things might get worse
if you meet Cha Jeong-yeon now.

00:40:16.455 --> 00:40:21.168
If a rumor spreads
that you pulled strings yourself--

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:22.503
Then I'll call him.

00:40:25.047 --> 00:40:27.091
I'll find a way.

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:28.759
Give me some time.

00:40:28.843 --> 00:40:31.095
Do that, but just act as a messenger.

00:40:31.178 --> 00:40:33.055
I'll make the final decision.

00:40:33.139 --> 00:40:36.725
You can't decide and act on your own
like you have been anymore. Got it?

00:40:39.895 --> 00:40:40.855
I understand.

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:43.441
Hurry up. We're short on time.

00:41:04.503 --> 00:41:07.256
I heard there's a problem
with Ji-yu studying abroad.

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:10.676
The school canceled
the letter of recommendation

00:41:10.759 --> 00:41:14.388
and the transfer,
saying they're reviewing her punishment.

00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:15.473
You're right.

00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:18.851
Goodness.
Things got out of hand so quickly.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.145
It was you, wasn't it?

00:41:21.228 --> 00:41:22.438
I told you,

00:41:22.521 --> 00:41:24.940
school bullying is a serious matter.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:29.320
Let's talk in person.

00:41:29.403 --> 00:41:31.780
Did you see that? The view count is crazy.

00:41:31.864 --> 00:41:34.074
Class 1-2 is in a complete mess.

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:35.534
Ji-yu is the one in a mess.

00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:37.912
It's so funny.
I mean, she must've gone crazy.

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:39.997
It is shocking. Why did she do that?

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.916
-What will happen?
-What else?

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:44.460
Ji-yu and her parents
will be dragged down.

00:41:44.543 --> 00:41:46.504
-By the way, who uploaded this?
-Ko A-ram?

00:41:46.587 --> 00:41:49.340
It can't be her.
Her face was blurred so thoroughly.

00:41:49.423 --> 00:41:52.009
Right, A-ram isn't the type
to be so meticulous.

00:41:52.092 --> 00:41:53.761
-It's Cha Su-yeon.
-It really is.

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:54.762
I'll livestream it.

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:55.763
Yes.

00:41:56.597 --> 00:42:00.518
No way. This is crazy.

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:02.895
This is

00:42:02.978 --> 00:42:04.647
the Judgement of Solomon.

00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:09.568
Here's a letter of recommendation
from the foundation's chair.

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:17.159
If you want to send Ji-yu overseas,
get a divorce.

00:42:19.912 --> 00:42:21.580
If you sign the divorce papers,

00:42:22.164 --> 00:42:24.291
I'll send Ji-yu abroad with this letter.

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.293
What are you playing at?

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:31.590
It's just too frustrating to watch.

00:42:32.341 --> 00:42:34.134
The politics need to stabilize

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:36.637
so the education and country
can stabilize.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.597
It benefits everyone.

00:42:38.681 --> 00:42:42.226
So I decided to step up.

00:42:44.353 --> 00:42:45.521
Did my husband agree to this?

00:42:47.022 --> 00:42:49.441
Did he want my signature
on the divorce papers

00:42:49.525 --> 00:42:52.528
so badly that he pushed
his own daughter off the cliff?

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.072
He has nothing to do with this.

00:42:55.155 --> 00:42:56.740
You expect me to believe that?

00:43:02.162 --> 00:43:04.540
Cha Jeong-yeon, you answer.

00:43:04.623 --> 00:43:05.541
Hey.

00:43:06.208 --> 00:43:07.835
You should be the one answering.

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:10.504
Do you want to save or kill Ji-yu?

00:43:13.674 --> 00:43:15.050
I told you.

00:43:15.134 --> 00:43:16.635
It's the Judgement of Solomon.

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:19.471
You sign the papers,

00:43:20.848 --> 00:43:23.350
and you keep the promise you made.

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.395
Hold on.

00:43:26.478 --> 00:43:28.564
Is it not the Judgement of Solomon?

00:43:28.647 --> 00:43:31.692
Is it more like
"Do you like Mom or Dad more" question?

00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:33.652
Well, whatever.

00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:36.655
What, you don't want to?

00:43:54.757 --> 00:43:55.924
Hello?

00:43:57.051 --> 00:43:58.761
It's been a while, Reporter Son.

00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:01.138
Cha Jeong-yeon!

00:44:03.557 --> 00:44:06.226
I enjoy watching News Magazine.

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:09.188
I saw how you backed Su-yeon
into a corner last time.

00:44:09.855 --> 00:44:13.233
Speaking of which,
I have some information.

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:15.027
You know,

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.696
everyone's talking about
what happened in my school.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.158
Reporters are bombarding me with calls.

00:44:23.202 --> 00:44:27.790
As the chairman,
I should clean up the mess.

00:44:27.873 --> 00:44:29.416
Exactly.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.627
The public deserves to know the truth.

00:44:34.296 --> 00:44:35.339
Go on your show?

00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:46.600
If you'd have me on your show,
that would be great.

00:44:52.064 --> 00:44:53.649
Let me see.

00:44:53.732 --> 00:44:56.944
This week's schedule…

00:44:59.988 --> 00:45:01.115
Fine.

00:45:02.616 --> 00:45:03.659
I'll do it.

00:45:10.416 --> 00:45:11.834
I'll divorce him.

00:45:15.796 --> 00:45:17.131
The president-elect couple

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:20.509
will be having a consented divorce
without a lawsuit.

00:45:20.592 --> 00:45:24.012
According to an anonymous source,
Cha accepted the conciliation…

00:45:26.432 --> 00:45:28.892
MUTUAL CONSENT DIVORCE

00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:45.742
Here's the custody
and parental rights agreement.

00:45:45.826 --> 00:45:47.411
You just need to sign it.

00:45:48.328 --> 00:45:51.582
We'll take care of the rest.

00:46:11.351 --> 00:46:12.436
I'm sorry.

00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:15.272
I made you make a hard decision.

00:46:18.692 --> 00:46:19.902
Ji-yu's going to study abroad?

00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:23.864
Can we

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.450
talk in private for a moment

00:46:26.533 --> 00:46:27.618
one last time?

00:46:49.932 --> 00:46:50.933
Do as she wishes.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.703
Do you want some coffee?

00:47:13.038 --> 00:47:14.998
I need to get some.

00:47:15.082 --> 00:47:18.085
I've stayed up all night,
and I'm not exactly awake.

00:47:31.723 --> 00:47:33.642
I said I'd vote for you.

00:47:39.273 --> 00:47:40.315
Don't you remember?

00:47:44.486 --> 00:47:46.321
The day we first met.

00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:55.706
ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE FOR HASEONG CITY,
CHA JEONG-YEON

00:47:55.789 --> 00:47:59.418
YEAR 2008
ELECTION SUPPORT TEAM LAUNCH CEREMONY

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:42.961
I heard you got an earful for whining.

00:48:52.888 --> 00:48:54.681
I'll rely on you for this election.

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:57.267
Help me out like you did Father.

00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:02.564
But you chose the wrong outfit today.

00:49:02.648 --> 00:49:04.149
It makes you look like the star.

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:08.278
Wear something plain
that doesn't stand out from now on.

00:49:08.862 --> 00:49:09.863
Got it?

00:49:11.698 --> 00:49:13.367
And smile a bit.

00:49:14.493 --> 00:49:15.827
Do what you're good at.

00:49:17.245 --> 00:49:18.080
Put up a front.

00:49:19.998 --> 00:49:21.166
Why must it be you?

00:49:21.249 --> 00:49:23.460
Well, isn't it obvious?

00:49:24.419 --> 00:49:25.629
Who did you think it would be?

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.466
Don't tell me…

00:49:30.717 --> 00:49:32.302
What's with that face?

00:49:32.386 --> 00:49:33.929
Did you think it'd be you?

00:49:36.682 --> 00:49:38.100
I can't because I'm a woman?

00:49:38.684 --> 00:49:41.645
I let you take the position
of the foundation's chair.

00:49:41.728 --> 00:49:43.563
It's not because you're a woman.

00:49:45.148 --> 00:49:46.525
It's because you're you.

00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:51.196
Nothing in our family belongs to you.

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:56.284
Everything you wear,

00:49:57.244 --> 00:49:59.037
down to your underwear.

00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:00.831
Nothing belongs to you.

00:50:05.377 --> 00:50:07.587
From drunk-driving to overseas gambling.

00:50:09.297 --> 00:50:11.550
Father lost the primary voting
because of you.

00:50:11.633 --> 00:50:13.385
What if you step up?

00:50:13.885 --> 00:50:16.972
Can you stop people
from calling you an illegitimate child?

00:50:17.055 --> 00:50:20.267
You're the risk to him, not me.

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.978
Your existence itself is a risk.

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:26.898
Do you think he coddled you
because he liked you so much?

00:50:26.982 --> 00:50:30.318
No, it's because you're a time bomb
that could blow up anytime.

00:50:30.402 --> 00:50:32.237
You're the worst bomb

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.406
that would blow us all up.

00:50:35.073 --> 00:50:37.576
Know your place and stop acting up.

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:41.496
Who cleaned up your mess
when you got into trouble?

00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.123
Who managed the district?

00:50:44.499 --> 00:50:46.960
Who made kimchi until her back ached

00:50:47.043 --> 00:50:50.714
and delivered it to nursing homes,
orphanages, and slums?

00:50:50.797 --> 00:50:52.466
People even gossiped

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:56.178
that I hoarded and speculated
on napa cabbage.

00:50:57.053 --> 00:50:59.598
Who made it so that commoners
view Father to be on their side?

00:51:01.016 --> 00:51:02.392
Politics…

00:51:03.977 --> 00:51:05.395
isn't about choosing.

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:07.856
It's about being chosen.

00:51:08.648 --> 00:51:09.775
Father said this.

00:51:09.858 --> 00:51:11.860
It's fine to dream about politics,

00:51:13.153 --> 00:51:15.363
but don't mistake it
for something like a dream.

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:17.282
What?

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:20.035
It's a dream?

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:25.582
Are you saying what I've done
all this while wasn't politics?

00:51:30.504 --> 00:51:31.797
Lower your voice.

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.174
Hey, how is that politics?

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:36.843
Handing out towels and kimchi,
God damn it…

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.470
You were just a servant.

00:51:40.722 --> 00:51:42.933
CANDIDATE 3, HYUN MIN-CHEOL

00:51:48.522 --> 00:51:49.689
Forget about it

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:52.400
and just live as a woman, okay?

00:51:52.484 --> 00:51:54.736
Politics isn't for everyone.

00:52:00.534 --> 00:52:03.703
God… Hyun Min-cheol has come
to make a scene again.

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.125
Testing the mic.

00:52:11.503 --> 00:52:13.630
-What is he doing?
-What?

00:52:13.713 --> 00:52:15.799
-What's happening?
-Can People's Party come in?

00:52:17.008 --> 00:52:18.718
What is it?

00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:49.332
Please vote

00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:52.419
for a young worker Cha Jin-taek.

00:52:53.128 --> 00:52:57.215
I'll make a healthy Haseong City
with everyone.

00:52:57.299 --> 00:53:00.218
-Why is People's Party here?
-Why is he here?

00:53:00.302 --> 00:53:02.721
-He's from another party.
-He's wearing green.

00:53:02.804 --> 00:53:04.264
Twenty years ago!

00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:07.601
This was what Cha said
as he ran for the National Assembly.

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:10.312
It has been 20 years!

00:53:10.395 --> 00:53:13.857
He isn't a broken record,

00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:17.944
and he isn't bone broth
that needs to be boiled over and over.

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:20.238
For every election,

00:53:20.322 --> 00:53:22.699
Assemblyman Cha Jin-taek
says the same thing.

00:53:25.452 --> 00:53:26.912
-Why is People's Party here?
-Why…

00:53:26.995 --> 00:53:29.956
The young worker Cha
that you believed in and voted for.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.751
What has he actually done
in those 20 years?

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:37.547
"I'll make a healthy Haseong City
with everyone."

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:39.966
Everyone.

00:53:40.634 --> 00:53:43.386
How healthy has Haseong City become?

00:53:44.512 --> 00:53:46.181
What is he doing up there?

00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:50.769
Are we just going to let him talk?

00:53:52.103 --> 00:53:54.230
Haseong High-tech Industrial Complex.

00:53:54.981 --> 00:53:58.234
Building it in Haseong City
is Cha's biggest achievement,

00:53:58.318 --> 00:54:02.364
or so this book brags for 500 pages.

00:54:02.447 --> 00:54:05.200
Do you know what's truly amazing
about the Complex?

00:54:05.283 --> 00:54:08.536
Multiple factories run day and night
for more than a decade,

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.373
but there has been no industrial accident.

00:54:11.456 --> 00:54:13.458
-What is he doing?
-What is he saying?

00:54:13.541 --> 00:54:15.168
That's right, a healthy Haseong City.

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:17.921
Even God couldn't perform such a miracle.

00:54:18.004 --> 00:54:22.050
Countless factory workers' injuries are
declared as personal negligence

00:54:22.133 --> 00:54:25.512
instead of industrial accident
under Cha's blessings.

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:27.180
It's already unfair,

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:31.101
but the moment you bring up the phrase,
you're fired from the factory!

00:54:32.018 --> 00:54:34.312
Are you going to let him go on?

00:54:35.063 --> 00:54:36.648
You're leaving already?

00:54:36.731 --> 00:54:39.651
Since he's here, I should go home.

00:54:40.735 --> 00:54:42.112
It's just a meaningless event.

00:54:42.195 --> 00:54:43.279
I know.

00:54:43.905 --> 00:54:45.323
But I hate this kind of event.

00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:47.575
Sure.

00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:49.494
See you at the next sponsorship, then.

00:54:49.577 --> 00:54:51.121
Do your best.

00:54:52.038 --> 00:54:53.790
I bet on you for this election.

00:54:55.208 --> 00:54:56.251
I got it.

00:54:56.835 --> 00:54:58.378
Oh, there he is.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:02.507
Haseong Petrochemical's
Vice Chairman Yang Hoon!

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:04.217
After sponging off Haseong,

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.345
he wants to move to New Town
because the union is causing a scene.

00:55:07.429 --> 00:55:10.306
A second-generation successor
with no shame or face.

00:55:11.016 --> 00:55:13.935
He's thinking hard of ways
to take over his father's company

00:55:14.019 --> 00:55:15.478
with no inheritance tax.

00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:21.693
God damn it, you little…

00:55:25.238 --> 00:55:27.824
The money that filled
the executives' pockets

00:55:27.907 --> 00:55:30.994
is used to reelect Cha Jin-taek
as a National Assembly member!

00:55:31.077 --> 00:55:32.829
Will you just watch it happen?

00:55:34.456 --> 00:55:36.583
How much longer will you

00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:39.711
let the brothers-in-law ruin Haseong City?

00:55:40.253 --> 00:55:41.921
It's time to change. We have to change!

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:43.339
This is insane.

00:55:49.888 --> 00:55:52.515
So he finally made
the big decision to change.

00:55:52.599 --> 00:55:53.933
And it's his son, Cha Jeong-yeon!

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:56.853
Drunk-driving, assaulting a cop,

00:55:56.936 --> 00:55:58.354
and gambling overseas.

00:55:58.438 --> 00:55:59.606
He gets into trouble

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:02.067
and cries and says
he'll turn over a new leaf.

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:03.693
New politics?

00:56:03.777 --> 00:56:04.694
Before doing that,

00:56:04.778 --> 00:56:07.655
he should become a decent
human being first, shouldn't he?

00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:09.365
What are you doing? Get him!

00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:16.331
Candidate Three, Hyun Min-cheol!

00:56:16.414 --> 00:56:19.292
Believe in me and vote for me!

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:22.170
I will change Haseong City
no matter what it takes!

00:56:22.253 --> 00:56:24.214
Is there anyone who will vote

00:56:24.297 --> 00:56:26.841
for Hyun Min-cheol, your true worker?

00:56:27.425 --> 00:56:28.551
Is there?

00:56:28.635 --> 00:56:30.261
This won't do. Drag him out.

00:56:30.929 --> 00:56:34.349
If you don't change,
Haseong City won't change!

00:56:34.432 --> 00:56:36.267
The world won't ever change!

00:56:36.351 --> 00:56:37.560
Let me go!

00:56:37.644 --> 00:56:38.770
Let me go!

00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:41.272
Let go!

00:56:51.825 --> 00:56:53.368
I'll vote for you.

00:56:55.495 --> 00:56:58.873
You will become
an assemblyman for Haseong.

00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:01.376
What is she doing?

00:57:05.296 --> 00:57:06.881
Isn't that a betrayal?

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:12.387
Twenty years ago,

00:57:13.221 --> 00:57:14.681
when I said I'd vote for you

00:57:15.557 --> 00:57:18.977
and make you assemblyman,
nobody believed me.

00:57:19.894 --> 00:57:21.229
Not even you.

00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:30.155
It's what I'm good at.

00:57:30.238 --> 00:57:32.740
Making the impossible possible.

00:57:34.576 --> 00:57:36.494
You know that better than anyone.

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:40.790
But

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:44.127
you forgot one thing.

00:57:46.504 --> 00:57:49.424
That there's something
I'm even better at than that.

00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:51.718
It's

00:57:52.594 --> 00:57:54.053
ruining something.

00:57:57.265 --> 00:57:58.808
It's much easier to ruin something

00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:02.395
than make something work.

00:58:06.441 --> 00:58:08.860
Just like how I ruined Cha Jeong-yeon

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:12.697
and how I ruined my father…

00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:19.037
This time,

00:58:20.079 --> 00:58:21.915
it will be you.

00:58:43.228 --> 00:58:45.313
Don't get Ji-yu involved.

00:58:46.773 --> 00:58:48.274
She's going overseas to study.

00:58:48.983 --> 00:58:50.568
Isn't that what she wanted?

00:58:50.652 --> 00:58:53.321
You have no right to speak her name.

00:58:53.404 --> 00:58:55.990
You dare to use her to make me

00:58:56.491 --> 00:58:57.534
sign the papers?

00:58:59.244 --> 00:59:00.662
How could you do that as her dad?

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:04.290
I didn't. You're mistaken.

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:06.209
I don't care if I'm mistaken.

00:59:06.918 --> 00:59:10.421
It doesn't change that
you schemed with Cha Jeong-yeon.

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:16.427
You know how much I detest him.

00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:18.304
You know how much I hate him.

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:20.723
You dare make a deal with him
using my daughter?

00:59:24.477 --> 00:59:27.522
I was worried you might be suspected
for pulling strings.

00:59:27.605 --> 00:59:29.148
In case it would harm Ji-yu.

00:59:29.232 --> 00:59:30.525
I'll protect Ji-yu.

00:59:30.608 --> 00:59:32.986
Do you think Jeong-yeon will sit back?

00:59:33.486 --> 00:59:34.445
For Ji-yu--

00:59:34.529 --> 00:59:36.531
I said I'd protect her!

00:59:37.991 --> 00:59:39.117
I said it'd blow up.

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.243
See the view count?

00:59:40.326 --> 00:59:42.203
This is a content worth watching.

00:59:42.287 --> 00:59:44.706
Screw you. It was filmed well, that's why.

00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:46.583
It might hit 100 million views.

00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:49.919
You're laughing so happily
when you have a black eye.

00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:51.421
It hurts, bitch.

00:59:52.672 --> 00:59:53.506
Sorry.

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:55.925
I'm joking.

00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:58.052
Don't be so serious, bitch.

01:00:03.808 --> 01:00:05.351
-What's with him?
-Are you crazy?

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:10.732
What are you doing, mister?

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:13.985
You're even eating our fries.

01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:15.570
You're really nuts.

01:00:15.653 --> 01:00:16.613
Mister?

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:20.283
Who are you?

01:00:20.366 --> 01:00:22.327
I'm a lawyer.

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:25.788
"Seon" in my name here

01:00:26.539 --> 01:00:27.749
doesn't mean "kind."

01:00:27.832 --> 01:00:29.751
It means "vicious."

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:31.836
What's he saying?

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:35.840
There are victims that want you

01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:37.884
to be punished viciously.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:44.682
Shall we watch this first and talk?

01:00:47.393 --> 01:00:48.519
Are you filming it well?

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:49.604
Here.

01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:52.440
What? How dare you.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:54.400
Hey.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:57.904
Hey.

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:00.823
Let's make it R-rated.

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:01.949
Shall we?

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:03.534
Hey.

01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:05.370
-Don't.
-Take it off.

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:07.121
Stop it.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:12.710
Stay still, okay?

01:01:12.794 --> 01:01:14.921
How did you…

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:17.131
Take it off!

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:18.675
How long did you think

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:22.595
you could pretend to be victims
when you were assailants?

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.474
I will protect Ji-yu.

01:01:27.308 --> 01:01:29.394
I will protect her even if my limbs break

01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:31.521
and I bleed to death.

01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:34.065
Just you watch.

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.244
Thank you.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.706
I won't need it ever again.

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:58.673
I clearly warned you.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:01.134
Don't touch…

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.678
my daughter.

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:17.710
Cha Su-yeon!

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:20.463
People are always angry.

01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:22.799
They always look for someone
to take it out on.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:25.426
What will happen

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.721
if the angry sentiment is
pointed at the President?

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.848
By wrongdoing, do you mean an affair?

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:33.267
Do you mean his affair
is the reason behind the divorce?

01:03:33.851 --> 01:03:36.979
It's going to be mud-slinging anyway,
so fight as dirty as you can.

01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:40.817
The target of the reporters

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.027
will change from me to him.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.572

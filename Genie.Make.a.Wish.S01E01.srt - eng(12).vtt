00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.679
I am a spirit created by smokeless fire,

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:13.805
a genie.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:17.017
We were created on Thursday,

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.269
the day after the angels.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:31.614
If you hear what I am saying now
in your native language,

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.701
that's because I am a genie.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.541
Genie, turn off the alarm.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:47.422
With our supernatural strength
and mystical powers,

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:48.965
we genies grew more arrogant,

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.426
even aspiring to surpass him.

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:54.387
But I had no interest in any of that.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.474
Becoming greater than him

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.310
would be such a hassle, no?

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:07.025
Despite this, he,
in his rage, sent his angels,

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.903
ordering them to decimate
the haughty genies.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.364
After 300 years,
when the long battle came to an end…

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:19.662
so did the lives of all genies
except a few, including myself.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.542
I took refuge in a lamp.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:29.297
Once the world was purified,
on the very next day, a Friday,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.966
he created another species to replace us.

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:35.428
Out of clay, he made you.

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:37.680
Humans.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.103
And then he commanded all
to bow their heads

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.146
to the first human he created.

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:49.317
All angels and surviving genies
bowed their heads,

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:53.071
but I refused to do so.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.373
APRIL 5TH
FLYING OUT

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.708
I, who was created from smokeless fire,

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.628
could not bow my head to a human

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:10.880
molded from mere clay.

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.801
Enraged, he threw me out of heaven.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.221
Fallen to hell,

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:20.306
I made just one request.

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:24.853
I would agree to my fate on one condition.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:27.564
That I be allowed to tempt humans

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.942
and drag them down to hell.

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:35.488
I vowed to prove to him

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.700
just how pathetic
his precious humans truly were.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:41.077
He granted my request

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.746
but named a condition of his own.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.001
Did you get that?

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.880
I shall grant your request.

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:53.923
But if you happen to meet

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.801
even one pure human soul,

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.137
you will be cast
to a depth greater than hell…

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.556
What's it rambling on about
all on its own?

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.849
Maybe it's broken.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.769
That is the origin story

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:09.647
of the three wishes
that you humans know of.

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:15.445
After that, I left hell to inhabit vessels
such as lamps, rings, or jars…

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:23.494
granting three wishes
to any human who summoned me.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.915
Humans are selfish and lazy.

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:30.835
They are insatiable
and quick to betray those closest to them.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.464
They kept sinking deeper into corruption,
and I was vindicated.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:36.090
I had been

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:37.926
right all along.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.303
But you.

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:42.931
You, from a small land in the East.

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:47.977
Even while taking your final breath,
you used your three wishes for others.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.188
It just could not be.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:51.814
Little girl.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.025
Little girl made of clay.

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:56.402
You frail, dying human.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.239
I shall observe your death,

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:04.994
and I shall take a handful of dirt
that is, in part, your flesh and bones.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:09.916
Because of you, my lamp might end up
buried deeper than darkness itself.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:13.086
But even so,
I will not bow my head to you,

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.796
a lowly being made of mere clay.

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:17.757
I shall remember your gaze

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.635
and the smell of your clay.

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:24.430
And, if a new master appears
and summons me,

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:28.268
when I am able to be
a part of this world once more,

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.311
I will scour the world

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.730
and find you again.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.275
I shall do whatever it takes
to corrupt you

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:37.986
and kill you.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.071
Remember this.

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.991
I will seek you out, and my name…

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:48.329
is Iblis.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.559
GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.272
One Gogung set meal.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.690
Right away, ma'am.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.372
Stop it.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:13.706
Stop coming.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.458
I saw you every year.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.793
I knew it was you.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.630
The same table, the same day.
Every year, for ten years.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.882
You've done enough.

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:24.384
Did you think I wouldn't know?

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:25.802
Of course you should know.

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:30.807
That's why Auntie's been leaving cash
and taking my photos for over ten years.

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:32.141
Right?

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:34.602
Mom.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.735
She said not to worry about money.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.196
- Just take care of Ka-young--
- Take care of her? How?

00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:47.115
What does she expect me to do?

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.033
So she doesn't seek out her mom.

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.118
Goodness!

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.744
That wretched bitch!

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.205
Should I tell Ka-young her mom's dead?

00:06:54.288 --> 00:06:56.124
And she calls herself a mother?

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.960
Goodness, she was just a little girl.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.005
What mother abandons her child
for being difficult?

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.369
That's when Grandma
started growing chilies.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.289
And so, every year,
the chili field grew, grew--

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:37.790
- I don't want to know.
- Grew…

00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:39.625
I don't want to hear it.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.211
- What is it you want to--
- Please don't cut me off.

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:46.340
After 20 years, you're finally hearing
your youngest daughter's voice.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.394
It grew, grew, and grew.

00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:00.354
It's much wider now.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:01.939
The chili field.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:05.234
How did you find out where we live?

00:08:06.402 --> 00:08:07.528
Are you quizzing me?

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:10.072
Bet you're happy to have ID.

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:12.533
Yes, I'm stoked.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.495
RESIDENT REGISTRATION
CERTIFIED COPIES, EXTRACTIONS

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:17.830
A copy of my residence record, please.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.086
You must be Ka-young.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.173
What brings you here?

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:28.758
I checked the register.

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:32.428
This building that you manage, Auntie,
appears to belong to my mom.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.388
Where are they now?

00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:37.934
My dead mom, dad,
eldest sister, and second sister?

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.571
One Gogung set meal.

00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:53.866
One Gogung set meal.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.368
One Gogung set meal.

00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:57.912
One Gogung set meal.

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:05.086
What do you do for your hands to be…

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:09.757
You know better than I do
why I abandoned you.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.342
I've sent you plenty of money.

00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:14.011
This? I bought it
with my hard-earned money.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:17.390
All the money you sent me
was donated long ago.

00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:21.644
These hands?

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.274
So you didn't even ask your sister
what I do for a living.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:31.696
It's work where I get scratched,
cut, and burned every day.

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:34.407
Don't I sound just like a murderous bitch?

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.747
Grandma told me
that people should always be kind.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.376
I know that face too.

00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:49.297
A face of fear.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.885
You learned to be kind?

00:09:55.803 --> 00:09:57.305
You say you know what fear is?

00:09:57.805 --> 00:09:59.307
If so, would I have left you?

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.434
You never even tried to teach me!

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.274
The thing is, ma'am,

00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:12.320
in Ka-young's case,
trying to teach her won't work.

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:13.821
How can that be?

00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:16.157
Why say that without even trying?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.952
Even if the whole world says
it's impossible, I won't give up on her.

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.705
Please just tell me about her classes.

00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:25.708
What did my Ka-young do to the frog?

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.752
Did she not do the dissection correctly?

00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:29.795
No. She actually did it perfectly.

00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:34.592
Then why did you ask to see me?

00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:37.178
That class was two months ago in spring.

00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:40.306
But Ka-young was still
pleading with me today.

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:43.225
She's been begging to dissect frogs again.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:46.520
She wants to do it all the time
and asks why we don't do it more.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.773
She's asked every single day since.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.038
That hurts.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:05.456
You hurt me!

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:09.168
The frog's hurting too.
But the frog can't even tell you that!

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:11.629
Damn it!

00:11:17.885 --> 00:11:18.803
I can't breathe!

00:11:19.887 --> 00:11:21.055
Neither can I.

00:11:21.972 --> 00:11:23.349
Let me go!

00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:26.185
I'll kill you, Grandma!
I'm gonna kill you!

00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:27.645
You let go first.

00:11:27.728 --> 00:11:29.271
I'll let go if you let go.

00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:46.997
That hurt! I'm going to kill you!

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:49.125
I'll kill you, Grandma!

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.170
When you hug someone,

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:55.172
I will also hug you.

00:11:56.132 --> 00:12:00.010
If you cut someone with a knife,
I will also cut you with a knife.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.555
And if you kill someone,

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:05.683
I will kill you too.

00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:10.062
These are our rules. Do you understand?

00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:11.814
Let go of me!

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:13.315
You're hurting me!

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.109
Learn through the pain.

00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:17.153
Learn until you're out of breath.

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:19.822
If you can't seem to learn, memorize.

00:12:20.948 --> 00:12:21.782
Ka-young.

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:24.994
Look closely at my face.

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:26.662
This is

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:28.330
despair.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:32.710
If you see Grandma making this face again,

00:12:32.793 --> 00:12:33.919
it means

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:37.047
that you and I will both die. Am I clear?

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:44.722
I missed it!

00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:48.809
Do it again! Your face of despair!

00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:26.305
I've already forgotten about the despair.

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.766
This is hope.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.935
The face of hope.

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.399
So, after that,

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.861
I stopped doing those things
because those were our rules.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:42.822
But living like that

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.741
means life is just no fun.

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:47.660
I'm so bored, Mom.

00:13:47.743 --> 00:13:50.704
- What on earth are--
- I told you not to cut me off.

00:13:53.707 --> 00:13:54.667
I was always curious.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.711
On TV, people in this situation
cry their eyes out.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.840
I wondered if I'd cry.
Whether you would cry.

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:03.509
I was just curious, you know.

00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:06.887
But here we are, both dry-eyed.

00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:09.765
Grandma sometimes cries in secret.

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:11.392
I assume

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:13.185
it's because of me.

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:15.312
But you know, Mom,

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:18.607
if Grandma ever cries
because of you again…

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.529
my hands will be wringing your neck.

00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:27.658
Until you are no longer able
to make any face at all.

00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:28.701
Until the very end.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.916
I came to say this
in case you ever did talk to me.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.918
Since you spoke to me this time…

00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:40.462
I won't be back.

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:45.009
Bye, Mom.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.222
THIS IS DUBI-DUBAI TOURS
PLEASE BRING AN EXTRA LAYER

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:46.445
My goodness, what a view!

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:47.863
"Dubai."

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.365
"Dubai."

00:15:51.575 --> 00:15:52.993
"Dubai."

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:55.079
"Dubai."

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:57.414
Listen up, everyone.

00:15:57.498 --> 00:16:00.292
Can you all see
that sand whirl over there?

00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:04.505
In Arabic culture, they refer to
that phenomenon as a "waltzing genie."

00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:07.633
No way, a genie?
You mean the lamp spirit we all know?

00:16:07.716 --> 00:16:08.759
How incredible!

00:16:08.842 --> 00:16:13.555
But it looks like a sandstorm is coming.
Are you all okay to continue the tour?

00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:17.685
You underestimate Koreans.
You all have your masks, don't you?

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:19.103
- Let's go.
- Sure.

00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:21.981
Okay, you've got an hour of free time.

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:24.066
- Feel free to keep taking photos.
- Okay.

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:27.695
The waltz is a partner dance,
but they're doing it solo? What a loser.

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:30.447
You're right. They're a total loser.

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:32.324
My gosh, you're right.

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:35.661
Goodness, dear. You're a hoot!

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.539
Wow, honestly, you're--

00:16:38.622 --> 00:16:39.790
Where's your hotel?

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:43.168
Oh boy, look at the genie!

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:45.504
Mom, wait for me.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.632
Waltz!

00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:11.280
How's the desert tour?

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:15.367
CHOI MIN-JI

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:17.911
Vast, hot, and windy.

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:20.914
Perfect for burying a family of four.

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:23.167
Stop that! Ticktock, ticktock.

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:57.076
Why are you getting in my way?

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:00.954
Why do you keep interfering?

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:05.459
What the hell did I do
to put that damn look of fear on you?

00:18:05.542 --> 00:18:09.129
You didn't even try to make an excuse.
And why is your skin so perfect?

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:10.130
You've had it

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:11.298
easy…

00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:14.176
all along.

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.846
The Gogung set meal tastes like crap.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.098
It's a damn rip-off!

00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:39.368
I just threw it behind me…

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.373
Who was that?

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:46.542
Who's messing with me, damn it?

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:26.456
Wow! The genie is dancing the waltz!

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:29.293
Amazing. It looks incredible!

00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:11.835
Move, and I'll stab you.

00:20:16.673 --> 00:20:17.799
Your hair is…

00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:21.678
Who are you? Why did you follow me?

00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:31.230
I said I'd stab you.

00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:34.858
So it is you.

00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:36.818
The smell of that clay.

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:39.738
The same lump of clay

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:41.907
that imprisoned me.

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:47.162
It's been 983 years.

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:50.958
You almost got me.

00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:03.011
What's with this almighty idiot?

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:05.847
WHAT'S WITH THIS ALMIGHTY IDIOT?
"What's with this almighty idiot?"

00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:09.851
There is only one Almighty. I'm a spirit.

00:21:11.853 --> 00:21:13.981
Listen carefully, little girl.

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:15.524
My name

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:17.734
is Iblis.

00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:20.195
I was created from a smokeless fire…

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.073
Why'd you shake my lamp like that?

00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:29.538
People know me as a Jinn

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.456
or Genie…

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.585
You shook it too hard.

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:40.048
Hey, stop there.

00:21:40.757 --> 00:21:41.758
My lamp.

00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:44.928
I told you to stop for a moment.
I know you're her!

00:21:45.929 --> 00:21:47.597
I'm Genie.

00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:52.269
I'm the one and only Genie,
spirit of the lamp!

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:08.618
It's actually this long, but I usually
wear it nice and short like earlier.

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:13.540
Damn.

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:18.337
I'll admit this is pretty impressive.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.671
How did you get in here?

00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:22.215
I'm pretty sure
I told you in a loud voice earlier.

00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:24.134
I am the lamp spirit, Genie.

00:22:28.805 --> 00:22:32.184
I can inhabit whatever I want,
"Kki Kka-young."

00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:35.562
You have perfect pronunciation,
but butcher my name?

00:22:37.272 --> 00:22:40.609
It appears that you don't quite grasp
the situation, so listen carefully.

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:43.612
I don't listen to what others say.
Only my grandma.

00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:45.447
Consider these your grandma's words.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.948
I'm here against her wishes.

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.075
Piss off!

00:22:48.158 --> 00:22:49.993
You're contradicting yourself!

00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:52.662
Do you seriously not remember me?

00:22:53.663 --> 00:22:55.499
From 983 years ago.

00:22:56.249 --> 00:22:57.250
Nothing rings a bell?

00:22:57.334 --> 00:22:59.294
If you're talking about 983 years ago,

00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:01.838
that'd be the Goryeo era.

00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:04.007
Choi Soo-jong founded a country

00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:07.594
and went on about something-jong
and this or that king, then Goryeo fell.

00:23:07.677 --> 00:23:09.221
How would I remember that?

00:23:09.304 --> 00:23:10.764
Is that how far back we go?

00:23:10.847 --> 00:23:14.309
Yes, that's how far back we go!
Look at my hair, will you?

00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:16.520
Come on, don't you see how long it is?

00:23:16.603 --> 00:23:17.604
I see it.

00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:21.066
So your hair grew that long
over 983 years,

00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:22.901
but your beard hasn't grown an inch?

00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:27.280
Of course,

00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:29.825
that's a perfectly valid question.

00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:33.412
But I don't really have an explanation,
and I'd rather move on,

00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:34.830
so can you just cooperate?

00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:38.834
Do you know what it took for me
to stay in that lamp for 983 years?

00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:39.751
I'll bite.

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:42.212
What did it take?

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.298
The dignity I was born with.

00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:49.803
Goryeo.

00:23:49.886 --> 00:23:51.430
Where the hell is Goryeo?

00:23:51.513 --> 00:23:54.141
I'm going to destroy it
as soon as I get out!

00:23:54.808 --> 00:23:57.686
The thing is, Master,
the land called "Goryeo"

00:23:57.769 --> 00:24:04.192
no longer exists as it was overthrown
by someone called "Yi Seong-gye."

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:07.487
They also believe
in the cycle of death and rebirth.

00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:10.740
Something "carnage," was it?

00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:12.909
Reincarnation.

00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:17.080
So they are reincarnated.

00:24:19.124 --> 00:24:21.251
Sade, head to that country this instant.

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:25.964
Go there and search every inch of it
with a fine-toothed comb.

00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:29.968
Check if that lump of clay was reborn.

00:24:50.614 --> 00:24:51.907
Hey, excuse me?

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.328
Right, look here. Can I…

00:25:00.874 --> 00:25:02.501
Excuse me? Might you have

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.003
seen this girl?

00:25:05.629 --> 00:25:09.257
I'm not sure. I don't think
I've seen her around these parts.

00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:26.066
I upheld my dignity,
even up to the 600-year mark.

00:25:26.733 --> 00:25:29.819
Though I guess
I did wear the lamp out a bit.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.661
Just let me out already, will you?

00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:41.665
Why do I only have one piece of furniture?
It's way too short for me!

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:44.876
I know you're listening.

00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:46.753
Hello?

00:25:48.296 --> 00:25:50.090
FUCK
F U

00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:51.883
F U

00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:53.218
Seriously?

00:25:58.265 --> 00:25:59.099
Darn lump of clay.

00:26:00.642 --> 00:26:02.769
I'm coming for you.
Just wait till I'm out!

00:26:03.603 --> 00:26:07.023
Master, something called
an automobile has been invented!

00:26:07.107 --> 00:26:11.486
These wheeled things
walk around on their own now!

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:15.115
I'm telling you so you don't freak out
or start gawking when you get out.

00:26:15.198 --> 00:26:18.118
Sade came by now and then
to inform me of the changing world.

00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:23.248
And when I visited the East, I acquired
the face of someone from that region.

00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:26.585
I like it so much
that I've been wearing it ever since!

00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:28.795
I'm not sure why,

00:26:28.878 --> 00:26:32.340
but the lady of the house
keeps giving me heaps of rice…

00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:37.137
That was around the 800-year mark,

00:26:37.637 --> 00:26:39.306
and I was ready to blow a fuse.

00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:40.390
Think about it.

00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:43.685
I sent countless humans to hell.

00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:46.730
Out of all those humans,
only one had a pure soul.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.773
So why is it all on me?

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.109
Does no one else find this odd?

00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:55.405
Going through all that
made me miss you so much. Truly!

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:57.907
I hoped you would be reborn

00:26:58.491 --> 00:26:59.701
and that, even once,

00:27:00.368 --> 00:27:03.371
you would find yourself dreaming
of meeting a spirit like me.

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:06.374
I hoped you'd have
a lot of friends and a lot of family

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.835
so I'd have
a ton of opportunities to ruin you.

00:27:08.918 --> 00:27:09.836
And then,

00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:13.923
when the 900th year rolled around,
I finally prayed.

00:27:15.216 --> 00:27:17.844
"Please, I beg for just one more…"

00:27:21.681 --> 00:27:22.515
Asleep, it seems.

00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:27.062
Dozing off on a genie?
What did you hear before your dreams?

00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:29.731
The 700-year part when I was midstream?

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:32.067
Would starting over be too extreme?

00:27:33.693 --> 00:27:34.736
Darn it.

00:27:58.677 --> 00:28:00.345
What the hell does it say?

00:28:01.388 --> 00:28:03.264
It says you shouldn't shake it.

00:28:03.765 --> 00:28:06.726
That an ill-tempered genie
might get angry.

00:28:08.436 --> 00:28:11.189
Well, you made a great first impression.
Dare I say, affable?

00:28:11.272 --> 00:28:12.774
Well, how kind of you.

00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:14.734
So you were awake?

00:28:14.818 --> 00:28:17.320
I just woke up
because it got so interesting.

00:28:20.156 --> 00:28:21.950
Or I woke up, and it got interesting.

00:28:23.118 --> 00:28:26.287
So what happened after you prayed?
Did you receive an answer?

00:28:28.123 --> 00:28:28.957
I did.

00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:39.050
Dear Iblis,

00:28:40.677 --> 00:28:42.345
I will grant your request.

00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:52.105
But if the day comes
when you bow before my creations again,

00:28:52.939 --> 00:28:56.860
you shall be beheaded.

00:28:58.319 --> 00:28:59.404
What did you pray for?

00:28:59.988 --> 00:29:02.782
"Please, I beg for just one more…"
and then?

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:06.119
Chance.

00:29:07.954 --> 00:29:09.539
Please, I beg for

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.041
just one more

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:13.918
chance.

00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:17.756
If the new master who releases me

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:20.383
is another of your cherished creations,

00:29:21.801 --> 00:29:23.636
if they are a truly righteous human,

00:29:24.137 --> 00:29:26.347
then I will banish myself
to hell forevermore.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.854
But if I do manage to corrupt them, then…

00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:39.319
let me be a free genie!

00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:44.407
Grant me the eternal freedom to move
between heaven and hell as I please.

00:29:45.658 --> 00:29:48.495
Sure, you might wonder
how that's any different from now,

00:29:48.578 --> 00:29:50.872
but the devil's in the details, you know?

00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:52.874
Okay?

00:30:04.219 --> 00:30:05.386
And at long last,

00:30:06.387 --> 00:30:08.848
I realized that a new master had appeared.

00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:14.312
But after all that, it's you again?

00:30:14.938 --> 00:30:16.523
I figured it was a good thing.

00:30:17.023 --> 00:30:18.691
But who knew you'd act like this?

00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:19.859
How have I been acting?

00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:22.278
Right now,
you don't respect or fear me at all.

00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:24.239
You're a mere lump of clay.

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:25.990
So I'm gonna prove it for good.

00:30:26.074 --> 00:30:28.159
What a failure his creations truly are.

00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:31.371
The extent to which
humans can be corrupted.

00:30:34.415 --> 00:30:36.793
You're saying this to my face?
Over breakfast?

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.507
So what is it that you want from me?

00:30:44.801 --> 00:30:46.719
Have we not discussed that yet?

00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:50.139
Oh, that's right.

00:30:50.223 --> 00:30:53.184
What I want is three of your wishes.

00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:55.520
Not one, not two, but three whole wishes.

00:30:56.104 --> 00:30:57.063
The rules are simple.

00:30:58.273 --> 00:30:59.482
No bringing back the dead.

00:31:00.275 --> 00:31:01.860
No traveling to the future.

00:31:02.986 --> 00:31:04.404
Anything besides that,

00:31:05.113 --> 00:31:06.406
your wish

00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:09.534
is my command.

00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:16.875
A face of seduction.

00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:18.293
Slick words.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.836
That's right.

00:31:20.336 --> 00:31:22.463
Come forth, into corruption.

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:23.965
You're an evil bastard.

00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:26.259
Wait, what? You figured that out already?

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:29.596
Well, you're right, I guess.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:31.764
Evil since before Christ.

00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:32.891
Piss off right now.

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:35.518
Or should my first wish be for you to die?

00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:36.519
Easy now.

00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:39.439
It's confusing
that you were born like this.

00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:42.400
Was the version of you 983 years ago
just full of it?

00:31:42.483 --> 00:31:45.111
Perhaps you weren't righteous,
just inarticulate.

00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:49.741
I was righteous?

00:31:51.826 --> 00:31:52.660
Me?

00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:54.913
Master!

00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:57.707
The girl was finally reincarnated!

00:31:58.291 --> 00:32:00.460
But a war broke out,

00:32:00.543 --> 00:32:04.589
and she died a hero,
fighting alongside a certain admiral!

00:32:05.548 --> 00:32:06.507
Right.

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:08.635
His name was Yi Sun-sin!

00:32:08.718 --> 00:32:11.304
I've found the girl again, Master,

00:32:11.804 --> 00:32:13.723
but she's dead this time too.

00:32:13.806 --> 00:32:16.893
Apparently, she was helping someone
this time too. Who was it again?

00:32:16.976 --> 00:32:17.894
Of course!

00:32:17.977 --> 00:32:19.729
I hear he was called An Jung-geun!

00:32:21.022 --> 00:32:24.442
You were like that for three lives,
but I guess this one's different.

00:32:25.193 --> 00:32:27.111
Pulling a knife at the drop of a hat?

00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:29.781
Now that's a habit I can get behind.

00:32:29.864 --> 00:32:32.408
Okay, let's properly corrupt you
in this lifetime.

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:33.785
At its core,

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:36.287
pleasure is needed for corruption.

00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:40.375
Master, I shall bestow the world's
greatest pleasures upon you today.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.377
Bring me a camel!

00:32:43.586 --> 00:32:45.088
I've already called an Uber.

00:32:47.548 --> 00:32:48.549
What's an "Uber"?

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:50.677
We don't ride camels anymore.
We ride Ubers.

00:32:51.719 --> 00:32:53.429
Right. And what is this "Uber"?

00:32:55.932 --> 00:32:57.266
Why should I tell you?

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.477
Why do we keep talking in circles?

00:33:01.938 --> 00:33:02.981
No, wait.

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:06.109
It's great that you're so rude.

00:33:06.734 --> 00:33:07.986
Uber? Sure.

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:11.572
983 years is a long time,
and in that time,

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:13.491
the world must have changed a lot.

00:33:13.574 --> 00:33:15.076
No wonder I'm out of the loop.

00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:16.786
I just need to remain calm.

00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:23.251
Sade the brat!

00:33:23.876 --> 00:33:26.379
Why didn't he tell me
about those two-wheeled things?

00:33:26.462 --> 00:33:27.755
It almost got me!

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:30.383
It did get you.

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:47.150
What is that?

00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:49.861
Why is it making that sound?

00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:56.117
Yes, Grandma?

00:33:56.784 --> 00:33:59.495
Right now? I'm going to go sightseeing.

00:33:59.579 --> 00:34:00.955
All right, good.

00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:03.666
You're keeping up with your meds, right?

00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:05.877
All right, attagirl.

00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:08.588
Don't eat too many cold foods,

00:34:09.088 --> 00:34:12.050
and steer clear of any boys
who try to chat you up.

00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:14.260
Don't look twice,
even if he calls you pretty.

00:34:14.343 --> 00:34:18.097
And if a guy says he'll do things for you,
put him on the phone right away.

00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:19.015
You got that?

00:34:19.098 --> 00:34:21.434
- She wants me to put you on.
- Put what on?

00:34:21.517 --> 00:34:24.812
No way. This face is set to be attractive
to anyone in the world…

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:26.355
What's she saying?

00:34:26.939 --> 00:34:28.566
I swear I heard a man's voice.

00:34:29.609 --> 00:34:30.443
Hello?

00:34:30.943 --> 00:34:31.778
Ka-young?

00:34:31.861 --> 00:34:32.820
Hello…

00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:35.198
Hello?

00:34:35.698 --> 00:34:37.116
The only reason I didn't kill

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.452
is because of my grandma's rules.

00:34:39.535 --> 00:34:43.164
I got it out of my system in other ways.
They say nothing beats fatigue.

00:34:43.664 --> 00:34:44.791
Beat?

00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:49.587
Oh, right. Beats fatigue… Fatigue, right.

00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:53.674
Yes. Every day from the age of eight
until I went to college,

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:57.345
I would plant sesame with my grandma
and then harvest it. Same with chilies.

00:34:57.428 --> 00:34:58.721
A FAMILY-ORIENTED PSYCHOPATH

00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:02.225
My entire body would ache,

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.937
but I had to memorize poems
and stay at the top of my class.

00:35:06.687 --> 00:35:09.023
Every day, I was so exploited for labor

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.984
that even if I thought,
"I want to kill something,"

00:35:12.985 --> 00:35:14.612
it would soon be morning.

00:35:14.695 --> 00:35:17.323
HIGH-FUNCTIONING PSYCHOPATH
SETTING A GOOD EXAMPLE

00:35:17.406 --> 00:35:20.493
I see. Man, I'm getting chills.

00:35:20.576 --> 00:35:21.953
You're so funny, ma'am.

00:35:22.036 --> 00:35:22.870
NO, IT'S NOT FUNNY

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:23.955
You're older than me.

00:35:24.038 --> 00:35:24.872
Sorry?

00:35:25.581 --> 00:35:27.250
You started farming two months ago?

00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:28.167
Yes.

00:35:28.918 --> 00:35:30.044
Do you have a car?

00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:30.962
Yes.

00:35:31.587 --> 00:35:34.298
Come by if you have an accident.
First service gets 10% off.

00:35:35.716 --> 00:35:37.969
Ma'am-- I mean, Ka-young?

00:35:38.052 --> 00:35:41.305
Whatever. You're totally scary
yet super funny.

00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:44.600
By the way, I'm just so curious.

00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:48.020
Do psychopaths really not feel love?

00:35:48.104 --> 00:35:51.065
You know, being ready
to give your life for someone else.

00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:52.358
I would be willing

00:35:53.526 --> 00:35:54.861
to kill for someone else.

00:35:55.862 --> 00:35:57.238
Doesn't that count as love?

00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:06.998
VIDEO UPLOADING

00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:12.837
Wow, how beautiful!

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.840
Mom, I want to buy everything here!

00:36:15.923 --> 00:36:16.883
Right?

00:36:16.966 --> 00:36:18.426
Wow, how beautiful.

00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:21.512
Tour guide, I want to buy everything here.

00:36:22.096 --> 00:36:24.307
Sorry, why are you telling me that?

00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:28.269
Make your three wishes.
Do it now. Right here. This instant.

00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:30.104
Get lost. Find yourself a barber.

00:36:30.688 --> 00:36:31.898
Is that a wish?

00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:34.025
Do you want to get slashed for real?

00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:40.531
Hey, why would you say such a thing?
What do you mean…

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.916
My gosh. Look at these lamps.

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:54.045
My gosh. Look…

00:36:57.673 --> 00:37:01.844
You know it's rude to come back
from overseas empty-handed, right?

00:37:02.845 --> 00:37:04.597
What is Dubai's most popular souvenir?

00:37:05.681 --> 00:37:06.807
Chanel, of course.

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:09.310
Right. Thank you.

00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:11.979
Where's the department store?

00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:15.858
I was only joking.

00:37:17.526 --> 00:37:19.403
I was joking too.

00:37:22.323 --> 00:37:24.659
Right, you were joking, weren't you?

00:37:25.493 --> 00:37:26.953
That was too funny.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:30.331
They're all right here. Magic lamps.

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:33.709
Goodness. Do you think
a genie will appear if I rub this?

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.378
Make your three wishes.

00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:38.256
Do it now. Right here. This instant.

00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:39.715
I told you to piss off.

00:37:40.216 --> 00:37:41.884
You've picked the wrong person.

00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:45.221
I have rules and routines.
Those two things keep my life going.

00:37:46.055 --> 00:37:48.557
So I don't have any wishes to begin with.

00:37:49.892 --> 00:37:51.143
May I ask

00:37:51.727 --> 00:37:54.146
who you're talking to?

00:37:56.482 --> 00:37:59.986
Genie. This bastard has been
talking to me nonstop since yesterday.

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:10.288
- Sheesh, she's so strange.
- Don't make eye contact.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.084
Right, only you can see me.

00:38:15.584 --> 00:38:17.086
One of my magical powers.

00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:19.630
You piece of shit.

00:38:19.714 --> 00:38:22.842
You beardless son of a bitch
with your stupid long hair.

00:38:22.925 --> 00:38:25.344
You just won't shut up! For fuck's sake!

00:38:25.428 --> 00:38:26.637
I told you to piss off!

00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:29.307
Why am I the only one to see you?
I look like a lunatic!

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:32.435
You're already corrupt.

00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:34.395
Very corrupt.

00:38:35.021 --> 00:38:36.939
All right, let's step it up a notch!

00:38:55.916 --> 00:38:57.251
Hey, you're back.

00:38:57.835 --> 00:38:58.753
So damn salty!

00:39:37.917 --> 00:39:39.418
This is driving me nuts.

00:39:39.502 --> 00:39:41.170
Try and get rid of me again.

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:44.840
I can't leave your side. You're my master.

00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:50.513
I'm considering other options.

00:39:51.931 --> 00:39:53.057
Are you the only genie?

00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:56.310
No. I'm the most famous genie.

00:39:57.144 --> 00:39:57.978
Why do you ask?

00:40:19.875 --> 00:40:20.835
Damn it.

00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:32.972
What the hell?
Do all genies look the same?

00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:37.893
Do you know a genie with long hair?

00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:41.856
I do. And I suppose you're looking
for that genie's weakness,

00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:44.775
or his flaws,
or perhaps a way to eliminate him.

00:40:44.859 --> 00:40:46.777
So you intend
to fight a genie with a genie?

00:40:47.653 --> 00:40:49.989
It's a new angle. I'll give you that.

00:40:50.072 --> 00:40:51.198
But, unfortunately,

00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:54.493
he is the only genie
among us brothers who grants wishes.

00:40:56.162 --> 00:40:57.872
If you've seen him, you'll know.

00:40:57.955 --> 00:41:01.792
He can inhabit any space in the world
and is perfect from head to toe.

00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:04.336
The walking definition of dignity.
Weaknesses?

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.380
None. Flaws? I'd love to give him one.

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:08.215
But eliminating him is quite simple.

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:11.260
I'm sure you've figured it out.
If you make your three wishes…

00:41:12.052 --> 00:41:12.887
Hey, on your left.

00:41:16.098 --> 00:41:17.391
You dare deceive me?

00:41:18.434 --> 00:41:21.896
That actually hurts. And what,
have you been all righteous and dignified?

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:23.939
You've rubbed every lamp you could find.

00:41:24.023 --> 00:41:26.358
He knows The Art of War?
That's not in my favor.

00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:32.156
If things aren't going your way,
start by changing the subject.

00:41:33.574 --> 00:41:35.618
You put your hair up. How pretty.

00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:40.706
It's a pain to lug around.
And it's so obvious that you're lying.

00:41:41.624 --> 00:41:44.919
If the conversation gets awkward,
just lean into it.

00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:49.006
Never mind the beard business.
How are we communicating?

00:41:49.089 --> 00:41:50.132
How do you know Korean?

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.012
I don't speak Korean.

00:41:55.095 --> 00:41:57.806
I'm speaking Arabic right now.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.225
But wherever I go,

00:41:59.308 --> 00:42:02.269
I sound fluent
because I'm the lamp spirit, Genie.

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.604
Make it sound like Arabic.

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:04.563
What did you say?

00:42:04.647 --> 00:42:06.941
You're Korean, aren't you?
You don't know Arabic.

00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:09.735
I'm not Korean or a person.

00:42:10.653 --> 00:42:12.905
How much is this? Where is the toilet?

00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:15.282
No cilantro, please.

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.034
- Happy?
- Sounds like basic Arabic.

00:42:17.117 --> 00:42:18.202
I'm a native speaker.

00:42:18.285 --> 00:42:20.371
Even your basic Arabic sounds rough.

00:42:20.454 --> 00:42:23.290
It's all in your head.
Have you always been so violent?

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:25.292
If so, I'll get my hopes up.

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:28.879
Is your grandma well? Why no wishes?
Do you really not remember me?

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:31.215
And he knows how to deflect.

00:42:32.007 --> 00:42:32.841
Enough of that.

00:42:32.925 --> 00:42:34.176
Do you know how to fly?

00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:36.470
When you watch shows with vampires,

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:38.806
they just fly off, all the way to…

00:43:26.729 --> 00:43:29.815
Move out of the way, crazy!
Are you trying to get killed?

00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:32.109
He's singing my praises.

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:05.559
"Can I fly?"

00:44:06.602 --> 00:44:09.730
Did that answer your question?
Who'd you say earlier? Vam… who?

00:44:11.523 --> 00:44:12.358
Wow.

00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:14.610
Wow.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.738
Wow.

00:44:19.573 --> 00:44:21.408
So you really are a genie.

00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:24.912
I'm now going to scream with happiness.

00:44:26.288 --> 00:44:27.915
I know how this goes.

00:44:28.749 --> 00:44:29.875
Go ahead!

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:56.360
Wait, why are you smiling like that?

00:44:58.278 --> 00:45:00.114
You smile differently from other humans.

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.491
This is real joy.

00:45:03.575 --> 00:45:04.618
Joy?

00:45:06.328 --> 00:45:07.913
So you finally have a wish?

00:45:07.996 --> 00:45:08.831
No.

00:45:10.249 --> 00:45:12.042
I finally have an opportunity.

00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:14.211
The perfect location.

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:17.214
The perfect adversary.

00:45:19.925 --> 00:45:21.969
From this height,
would his skull crack first?

00:45:25.013 --> 00:45:26.432
No telling my grandma.

00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:42.322
Who exactly is your grandmother?

00:45:45.325 --> 00:45:46.493
That was way too quick.

00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:56.837
Man, you startled me.
Your timing was completely unexpected.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.422
"Man, you startled me"?

00:45:59.673 --> 00:46:03.093
Most people panic while pushing someone,
but you're only just startled?

00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:08.223
I should have been slower to get mad.

00:46:10.142 --> 00:46:12.394
Your arm broke first? Not your skull?

00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:16.523
Depends on how many times you spin

00:46:17.232 --> 00:46:19.777
and whether it's a clean drop
or if you hit a building.

00:46:21.236 --> 00:46:23.989
I hit a building,
so I came up a little sooner.

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:27.743
I smashed my head and back
but pieced myself together on the way up.

00:46:27.826 --> 00:46:29.536
I see.

00:46:32.873 --> 00:46:34.541
But I know that face.

00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:37.961
Real

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:40.798
rage.

00:46:43.008 --> 00:46:44.176
If you knew, why do it?

00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:46.970
Don't you agree, Master?

00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:03.070
I accept

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:05.155
whatever punishment.

00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:06.824
So please,

00:47:07.366 --> 00:47:10.410
make sure we are punished.

00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:12.871
You and I both.

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:17.084
I hoped you'd be different,

00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:19.002
but not this different.

00:47:21.463 --> 00:47:22.548
What exactly are you?

00:47:24.132 --> 00:47:25.008
Beg.

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:27.177
Beg for your life.

00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:30.764
Tell me it's your first wish.

00:47:31.974 --> 00:47:32.808
Wish it.

00:47:34.142 --> 00:47:35.352
Seeing this,

00:47:36.728 --> 00:47:39.773
I can tell those wishes
won't do me any good.

00:47:42.234 --> 00:47:43.110
How smart of you.

00:47:44.152 --> 00:47:47.489
You're right. Once you've made
all three wishes, and I'm no longer bound,

00:47:48.073 --> 00:47:49.700
I'm going to kill you.

00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:55.414
If that's your plan,

00:47:55.497 --> 00:47:57.416
why not just scrap the wishes

00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:59.918
and throw me off right now?

00:48:02.129 --> 00:48:03.380
I'm having

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.675
an absolute blast right now!

00:51:48.814 --> 00:51:54.820

GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.111
If that's your plan,

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:12.989
why not just scrap the wishes

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.784
and throw me off right now?

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:17.410
I'm having

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.830
an absolute blast right now!

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:26.002
You're enjoying this?

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.253
Yes.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.006
I was so bored with life,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.175
but my heart is racing right now.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:36.679
This is fun?

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.186
Fine. Let me kick things up a notch.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:16.302
It is you.

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:19.931
That lump of clay.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.100
I'm sure of it.

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:29.816
I guess I've been too complacent.

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.611
Is this how corrupt humans have become?

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:36.865
Are you humans already beyond temptation?

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:40.326
How was it when you fell?
Did you feel any pain?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.413
Let me in on your plans.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.583
While you're trying to kill me,
can I try to kill you too?

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:54.924
I'm warning you.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.969
Lay a finger on me again,

00:02:59.053 --> 00:03:00.930
and I will wipe out your entire kind,

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.558
every single being apart from you,

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:05.852
from the elderly to infants.

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.647
I will exterminate every last being,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.816
sparing no one…

00:03:14.068 --> 00:03:16.029
if that's what it takes
to watch you suffer.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.577
For 983 years,
you've been part of my plans.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:26.206
Wait.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.917
You're just leaving me here?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.960
How am I supposed to get down?

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.519
Four wheels?

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:53.650
Must be the things Sade mentioned
that walk around on their own.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.304
My mythical beast, Sade.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.100
Master?

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:29.269
When did you get out here?

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.020
Get out.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:36.609
There are a lot of eyes on me right now,
so I'll meet you over at the oasis.

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:37.777
I'll see you later.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.321
I've changed a lot,
so try not to be too alarmed.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.824
Get over here this instant!

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:47.620
I was born of a single glistening tear

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:51.040
shed on a strand
of my master's silky raven hair.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:56.629
If you hear what I am saying now
in your native language, that's because--

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.132
What are you mumbling about?
Get your ass over here!

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:03.303
It's been far too long.
I've missed you, Master.

00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:06.055
Master's scent.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:10.351
Cut it out. You seemed
perfectly happy serving other masters.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.812
I was only doing what I had to.
Take a look.

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:16.316
Even the oasis
has become a luxurious hotel.

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:22.530
Animal protection laws prohibit hunting,
so I'm practically a herbivore now.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.583
By the way, did you get hurt?

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.044
Earlier, I felt my head splitting
and my back breaking.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.172
There was a bit of a situation.

00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:44.385
Don't tell me banging my head
made your face so…

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:45.970
What about my face?

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.306
Right, you haven't seen me like this.

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.975
This is the face
I mentioned taking a liking to.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.269
What?

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.980
Where should I even start
bringing you up to speed?

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.775
Anyway, so you finally have a new master.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.069
Well? Do they look like
they'd have a lot of wishes?

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.153
No.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.864
She says she doesn't need any wishes.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.949
It's honestly so strange.

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:58.668
You're in my seat.

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:02.922
This is my first time
riding a carpet like this one.

00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:04.841
And this. It's so delicious.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:10.388
- You abandoned me in your hotel.
- I didn't abandon you. I left you there.

00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:12.932
- Yeah, you abandoned me.
- No, I left you there.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.644
Will we ever have a proper chat?

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.605
I already told you.
I can't leave your side.

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:23.276
I'm saying stop wasting your time.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.866
I feel drowsy after the meal.
See you in Goryeo.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.540
What a pain in the ass.

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:40.001
We'll talk later.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.754
For now, our hairstyles
are way too similar.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.632
Stop wearing it in a bun,
or shave your head already.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.218
I busted my ass with hair masks
to grow this out,

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.345
so you change yours! You hear me?

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.187
We want them nice and crispy.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.521
I'm home.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:02.565
My word.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:05.401
What is it?

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.904
Ka-young, I thought
you were glowing lately.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:09.697
It must be because you're dating.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.365
I don't date.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:12.909
I've just always been pretty.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:13.826
Then

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.662
who is that lanky man with you?

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.296
Don't say a word. Not a single word.

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:28.216
He's just a souvenir.

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:30.259
That's Granny An,

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.677
Granny Park,

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.221
Granny Sa,

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:34.722
and my grandma.

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:37.517
Goodness, this is incredible.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.520
She went overseas
and brought back a potential husband.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:42.438
He's not a potential husband.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.439
We're just

00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:45.233
sharing a room.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.400
What?

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.569
Well, if you share a room,

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:51.239
who's to say, you know?

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.074
Who knows what might happen?

00:08:53.157 --> 00:08:55.701
Pan-geum, you'll have
great-grandchildren in no time.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.286
Come on, stop that.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:00.081
Have you eaten?

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.918
Welcome. I'm An Bok-ja.

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:07.380
Right, well, I think Lee Beul-li
will be a suitable name for me.

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:08.464
"Lee Beul-li"?

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:10.800
Lee Beul-li?

00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:13.678
Follow me.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.391
Goodness, why take a detour to the shed
before going inside?

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.102
Enough of that!

00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:23.729
What are you doing?
It'll burn. Hurry up and flip it!

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.022
It's cooked perfectly.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:27.942
"Lee Beul-li"?

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:32.321
I did some research.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.740
Everyone here has three-character names.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.951
An Bok-ja. Ki Ka-young.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.661
Lee Beul-li.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.664
It makes sense. I'll give you that.

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:42.915
But…

00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:46.586
Never mind. Whatever works for you.

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:50.590
All right, ground rules.
Stay out of sight of the grannies.

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:52.800
And definitely stay
out of sight of the locals.

00:09:52.883 --> 00:09:55.928
No going into town.
No getting caught using magic.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.306
No telling me to make a wish.

00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:01.684
Then, what can I do?

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:05.771
I came all this way, and for what?
You want to kill me?

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:08.858
If that's what you desire, wish it.
It's simple.

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.736
Why would I use a wish on that?
I could do it myself.

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:18.743
What are you yapping about to yourself?

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:22.246
Where did that lanky fellow go?

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:24.707
Why the pickax?

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.462
Only I can see you again?

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:31.047
You said to avoid the grannies.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.424
What is it?

00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:34.842
Are you seeing things?

00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:36.344
Did you skip your meds?

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.514
Cover your ears.

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:42.975
Maybe I'll just kill this--

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.144
Kill what? Who are you going to kill?

00:10:45.227 --> 00:10:47.855
Ka-young, you remember
your promise to me, right?

00:10:47.938 --> 00:10:49.023
Remember our rules?

00:10:58.699 --> 00:10:59.700
I do.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.809
Your mom, dad, and older sisters

00:11:24.892 --> 00:11:26.435
aren't coming back.

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:28.270
They're all dead.

00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:30.314
But how did they die?

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.566
I only killed Mom's parrot.

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:35.403
Mom, Dad, and my older sisters.

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:36.529
I didn't kill them.

00:11:36.612 --> 00:11:38.072
Of course you didn't.

00:11:38.572 --> 00:11:40.366
Grandma knows you didn't.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:44.495
And you won't kill anyone
in the future either.

00:11:44.995 --> 00:11:46.706
And no killing birds either.

00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:50.084
Let's live a long life together,
me and you, okay?

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.713
But they said they'd come back.

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:55.381
They promised.

00:11:57.925 --> 00:12:01.053
So why are they dead?
How could they die without my permission?

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:18.654
From now on,
this is what you do when you're angry.

00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:23.367
Close your eyes and listen to the watch.
It goes ticktock, doesn't it?

00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:27.955
Let's listen to that sound 60 times
and try to hold it in for one minute.

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:30.082
I don't want to. Get off me.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.168
I'm still angry, so what now?

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:34.754
Then you should listen for two minutes.

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:36.464
Let's try it, okay?

00:12:37.381 --> 00:12:38.466
No!

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:40.551
Just put it away! Get rid of it!

00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:43.721
Get rid of it already! Now!

00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:45.306
I don't want this!

00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:50.019
KA-YOUNG'S STUDY COMPILATION 1

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:53.731
Mr. Chang-sik made this for you.

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:55.274
Shall we take a look?

00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:58.027
Oh my, this looks like fun.
Don't you think?

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.070
Congratulations. You have a baby girl.

00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:01.864
- Chae-a.
- My goodness.

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:04.033
- Our precious princess!
- It's me, Dad.

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:05.618
See that, Ka-young?

00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:09.205
That dad and grandma
look incredibly happy, don't they?

00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:12.124
That is real joy.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.795
766 seconds, 767 seconds, 768 seconds,

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:18.172
769 seconds, 770 seconds…

00:13:18.255 --> 00:13:19.673
We did everything we could,

00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:22.760
but the child's mother
passed away during childbirth.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:24.303
Sorry?

00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:27.056
Good heavens! How upsetting.

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:30.267
That there is real sorrow.

00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:32.853
They've lost someone they love.

00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:36.982
781 seconds, 782 seconds, 783 seconds…

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.985
Dad, you can't let go. You just can't.

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:41.987
Of course. Dad's holding on tight.

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:43.280
You're still there, right?

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:45.115
- I sure am!
- Did you let go?

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:47.159
Wow! Hooray for my darling Chae-a!

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.286
Hooray!

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.539
Now that is real happiness.

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:53.123
Go slow! Slow down!

00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:56.377
You should try it too.
The more you try, the better you'll get.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.379
798 seconds, 799 seconds,

00:13:58.462 --> 00:13:59.964
800 seconds, 801 seconds…

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:02.800
The thing is, ma'am,

00:14:02.883 --> 00:14:06.095
in Ka-young's case,
trying to teach her won't work.

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:11.976
806 seconds, 807 seconds, 808 seconds,
809 seconds, 810 seconds, 811 seconds…

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:13.769
And this

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:15.688
is affection.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.566
Warm, isn't it?

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:19.900
820 seconds, 821 seconds…

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:22.027
She lacks a sense of guilt,

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:24.405
and because she's unable
to control her rage…

00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:28.492
Oh boy, my dear Ka-young is warm.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.079
Goodness.

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:35.749
My dear crybaby is so warm.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:41.839
Goodness me.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.384
My stubborn darling is warm.

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:49.263
845 seconds, 846 seconds, 847 seconds,

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:53.517
848 seconds, 849 seconds,
850 seconds, 851 seconds…

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:04.445
Didn't I tell you
not to take the stone out?

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:10.743
Come hell or high water, I won't let you
take it out until tomorrow.

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:12.411
There.

00:15:13.787 --> 00:15:16.624
Why are you doing this?
Why should I put up with it?

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:17.750
It's uncomfortable.

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:19.001
That's exactly it.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.045
That's what discomfort is.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:25.299
When people glare at you like this

00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:27.134
or narrow their eyes at you like this,

00:15:27.217 --> 00:15:29.303
it's not because they don't like you.

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:31.555
They're just uncomfortable
around you, okay?

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:34.224
You sure like to talk, Grandma.
You're such a pain.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:37.519
What do I have to do
to get out of living with you?

00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:42.483
If you study really hard
and go to college,

00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:44.652
you won't have to live with me anymore.

00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:47.071
But the thing about studying is

00:15:47.154 --> 00:15:50.908
you have to take it seriously
and be top of your class.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.338
And if you succeed, then you must attend
a prestigious college.

00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:05.547
KI KA-YOUNG
TOP ADMISSION SCORE

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.175
The National University of Science
and Technology is a big deal!

00:16:08.258 --> 00:16:09.885
And once you graduate from college,

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.931
you must get a job
that pays a regular salary.

00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:17.309
Thanks! And congratulations.

00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:18.644
- Oh boy.
- Thank you.

00:16:18.727 --> 00:16:19.770
Congratulations.

00:16:19.853 --> 00:16:22.773
- Congratulations.
- You've picked the perfect spot.

KI KA-YOUNG
TOP ADMISSION SCORE

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:33.575
How can she be both the town's pride
and the village fool at the same time?

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:34.785
Honestly!

00:16:34.868 --> 00:16:35.786
At the same time?

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:37.871
You were saying…

00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:39.999
Where did you go to college?

00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:43.544
We didn't even breach

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:45.629
the subject of college.

00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:47.339
And more importantly,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.342
I was a little tied up at the time.

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:54.013
Even so, a similar
educational background is important.

00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:57.057
Ka-young got into the National University
of Science and Technology

00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:58.809
with top marks and graduated early.

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:00.811
A high school grad?

00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:09.111
What was your CSAT score?

00:17:13.657 --> 00:17:17.202
- Your grandma is fuming.
- Why?

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:18.454
Something about you

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.415
doing two things at the same time.

00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:24.334
Don't ever do that again.
She seemed really disappointed.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.638
- Hands off.
- Oh yeah?

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:44.354
I said hands off.

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:54.740
You push pretty hard.

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:01.914
So I guess that's how humans imagine me.

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:05.042
THIS ANCIENT BOZO'S FIRST TIME SEEING THOR

00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:06.877
- Is that me with the hammer?
- It's not.

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:10.089
It's not? But we have the same hair.

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:11.465
Then…

00:18:11.548 --> 00:18:13.050
CAPTAIN AMERICA JUST PASSED BY

00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:15.052
- Him with the star tray--
- Not him either.

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:17.554
Oh, I know.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:19.932
The one wearing the red aluminum suit…

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:22.643
No, it's not. It's not you!

00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:25.562
They're Marv*l. You're Disn*y.

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:27.564
You have
totally different target audiences.

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:28.774
You and these guys…

00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:31.819
Your worlds simply cannot mix.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.987
This is all we can say.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.741
But I need to know more
to make sure we don't mix.

00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:40.202
I couldn't hear anything
through those bleeps.

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:41.995
You may be a genie,

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:45.207
but you will never hear
through the bleeps.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.960
Copyright is serious business.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.294
Copyright?

00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:50.504
If you must hear,

00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:54.049
you can go and seek permission
from the "Big Mouse" himself.

00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:59.221
I'm an actual genie in the flesh.
Why would I need permission?

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:00.722
Who is this mouse anyway?

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:06.520
- So this is the modern-day plaza?
- Yes.

00:19:06.603 --> 00:19:09.398
With three IDs,
I basically control public opinion.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.986
- Trust me.
- Okay.

00:19:15.445 --> 00:19:17.865
I'm honestly speechless,
so let me TL;DR this.

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:20.033
Something outrageous happened to me.

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:24.163
I'm a genie, but copyright stops me
from even mentioning the famous mouse.

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:26.456
I'm the genie. This makes no sense.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.916
That's not all.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.211
They made a movie about me,
but guess what they called it. Aladdin!

00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:36.466
I've never even met an "Aladdin."
Upvote if you can relate.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.885
So what's this plaza called?

00:19:39.761 --> 00:19:40.637
Mate Pann.

00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:41.763
"Mate Pann."

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:44.433
See? They're already going wild
in the comments.

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.060
I told you, Master. You can count on me.

00:19:47.769 --> 00:19:48.645
You don't say?

00:19:49.396 --> 00:19:50.522
A GENIE ON MATE PANN?

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:51.565
GO TOUCH GRASS, BRO

00:19:51.648 --> 00:19:53.233
WE NEED ALADDIN'S SIDE OF THE STORY

00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:54.693
BIG CAP, GO SEEK HELP

00:19:54.776 --> 00:19:56.361
But why are they criticizing me?

00:20:01.408 --> 00:20:04.119
You call this studying?
You're really going places, huh?

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.829
Did you learn to read Korean?

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:11.877
Mr. Seo I-deuk, what are you doing here?
You said you'd chop wood for the hall.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.463
I was just getting up
to go over there now.

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:15.881
By the way, have you eaten?

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.467
Sit down while I'm being nice.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.052
The plaza is over here.

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:20.969
Who is that?

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.513
Are you two close, Mr. Seo?

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:26.391
We have almost a millennium
to catch up on, so, you know.

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:27.559
Never mind. Let's go.

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.770
I told you to come.

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:31.605
Come here now!

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:34.107
Hey, what the hell?

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:36.443
Come on!

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:39.321
I'm going to kill
whoever pulled that crap.

00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.700
I was just about to level up, damn it.

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:53.418
The mountains will soon be
stripped bare of trees.

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:56.546
He's the young man staying
at my Sang-tae's guesthouse for a month,

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.340
and he's so handy.

00:21:01.468 --> 00:21:02.886
Would you look at that?

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:22.155
What's a car like that doing
in a town like this?

00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:26.743
Right. It's the psychopath's car.

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:28.954
What? Why would you say such a thing?

00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:32.165
Hello.

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:34.876
- I think she heard you.
- It's all right. She knows it too.

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:36.545
Hey.

00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:38.547
Drive carefully, you!

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.175
She has one of those anti-psycho
character disorders or something.

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:45.053
Granny Park, it's called
"anti-social personality disorder."

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.097
Don't forget to apply sunscreen.

00:21:48.181 --> 00:21:49.308
All right!

00:21:50.892 --> 00:21:54.354
By psychopath, do you mean
the type that kills people?

00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:56.565
She doesn't kill people, though,

00:21:56.648 --> 00:22:00.110
because we all raised her
together as a village.

00:22:00.193 --> 00:22:01.695
And how did you raise her?

00:22:01.778 --> 00:22:03.447
Who are you? How'd you get here?

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.949
What are you doing here? How very strange.

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:08.744
Right, he's her potential husband.

00:22:09.244 --> 00:22:10.579
So how did you raise her?

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:11.997
Well,

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:14.666
at first, it was utter chaos.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.793
Worse than anyone could've imagined.

00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:24.634
This is "gi-yeok."

00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:27.262
This is

00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:29.306
"ni-eun."

00:22:31.933 --> 00:22:35.020
This is "di-geut."

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.232
Things get a little tricky from here.

00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:40.984
Are you up for it?

00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:21.024
This girl.

00:23:21.108 --> 00:23:22.442
Dear, oh dear.

00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:26.029
Here. Try one first.

00:23:26.113 --> 00:23:28.532
You need to cut the rice cakes,
not smash them.

00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:30.409
Knife up against the rice cakes…

00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:33.370
And so, the entire neighborhood

00:23:33.453 --> 00:23:36.540
came together to raise that tiny devil.

00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:38.583
Devil, you say?

00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:40.836
That's it. There you go.

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.087
What exactly are you?

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:55.434
- You busy?
- I'm almost done. Can I help you?

00:23:56.017 --> 00:23:58.437
I broke a tail light while parking.

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:10.240
You don't need to uncover
the truck bed to change it, right?

00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:11.867
My truck's loaded to the brim.

00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:13.326
It's fine.

00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:16.496
I clock out at 6:00,
so just come back before then.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.791
I'll leave it with you, then.
I'm going to eat at my mom's restaurant.

00:24:35.182 --> 00:24:36.892
I see you've already started.

00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:41.980
I bought more pork belly.
Let me know if you need it.

00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:44.524
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:47.527
By the way, Mr. Eom,
is the Wi-Fi here normally this bad?

00:24:47.611 --> 00:24:49.321
It's the altitude.

00:24:49.404 --> 00:24:52.407
Why not give your phones a break
and enjoy your time here?

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:55.660
He's right.
I hear I-deuk doesn't even have a phone.

00:24:56.536 --> 00:24:59.372
I-deuk! You should stop chopping
and join us.

00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:02.042
I don't actually like cooked meat.

00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:03.210
Enjoy!

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.174
GRANDMA

00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:13.929
Buy bean sprouts, those adhesive
pain relief patches, tofu, and bread.

00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:16.765
What is that?

00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:19.351
- That looks so cool.
- I told you not to come into town.

00:25:19.434 --> 00:25:20.560
Buy me one of those.

00:25:21.061 --> 00:25:21.895
No, buy me three.

00:25:50.674 --> 00:25:54.261
I heard you brought a potential husband
from the Middle East. Is that him?

00:25:54.344 --> 00:25:57.639
Hello. He's not a potential husband.
Don't say a word.

00:25:57.722 --> 00:25:58.890
But…

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:02.310
Don't you tell me he's not
when he clearly is!

00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:07.524
The talk of the town is
how we should plan the wedding.

00:26:07.607 --> 00:26:08.525
As for me,

00:26:08.608 --> 00:26:13.154
I'm Park Chang-sik, the village chief
here at Cheongpung Village.

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:16.241
Here we have the youth association.
Left, Jwa Jong-heon. Right, Woo Min-jae.

00:26:16.324 --> 00:26:17.534
Say hello.

00:26:17.617 --> 00:26:18.827
Nice to meet you.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.329
Wow, you're as tall as the 63 Building.

00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:23.873
It's a nice area, isn't it?

00:26:23.957 --> 00:26:26.042
Thanks to our Ka-young here,

00:26:26.126 --> 00:26:29.337
our village has nothing to worry about
in terms of public safety.

00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:32.799
Why am I the only one talking?

00:26:35.051 --> 00:26:36.761
Am I the only one with a mouth?

00:26:37.304 --> 00:26:39.347
Am I the only one
who's happy we're meeting?

00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:43.560
Just say hello. Keep it short.

00:26:44.185 --> 00:26:45.228
Shall I, then?

00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:49.441
It appears that
you are the chieftain of this village.

00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:52.777
Nice to meet you too, Park Chang-sik.

00:27:08.251 --> 00:27:10.045
- Chang-sik!
- What the hell was that?

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.923
Please calm down.
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

00:27:14.007 --> 00:27:16.051
What the hell did you do?
What did you do to my nose?

00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:20.555
What made you fall for me?
Am I damn irresistible?

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:21.973
Chang-sik, use your words.

00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:23.808
I told you to let go of me!

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:29.689
What the hell? Where'd he go?

00:27:32.359 --> 00:27:33.652
Did he make a run for it?

00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:42.327
What just happened?

00:27:43.244 --> 00:27:44.162
Where did he go?

00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:46.790
Where could he have gone?

00:27:48.124 --> 00:27:49.834
I wonder where he is.

00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:52.128
Damn it.

00:27:52.212 --> 00:27:54.214
CHEONGPUNGHO MART

00:27:54.297 --> 00:27:57.801
How many times must I tell you
to pay attention to the entrance display?

00:27:57.884 --> 00:27:58.843
The entrance is…

00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:01.846
"The face of our store."
But you keep leaving it bare.

00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:03.348
Don't you?

00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:06.226
Answer me, please.

00:28:07.268 --> 00:28:08.520
I'm sorry.

00:28:09.312 --> 00:28:11.815
The freight elevator
is under maintenance, so…

00:28:12.315 --> 00:28:13.400
Ms. Kang Im-seon?

00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:15.735
Does our store not have stairs?

00:28:16.486 --> 00:28:17.529
Get a move on.

00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:20.365
Right, I'll get to it now.

00:28:28.289 --> 00:28:31.584
Men don't greet each other like that
in this country. That's the rule.

00:28:33.002 --> 00:28:34.170
What is this place?

00:28:35.672 --> 00:28:36.923
And what's that?

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:42.137
What is this place?

00:28:43.138 --> 00:28:44.347
Stay still already.

00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:48.393
I'm sorry, but can you see that man?

00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:52.397
Yes. He's handsome. Why do you ask?

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:56.943
Just wondered if he was only
handsome in my eyes. Thank you.

00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:04.826
Chief Park is a former marine,
and his motto is "My pride is my success."

00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:08.955
What are you gonna do now?
You're… done for.

00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:12.500
So you think I'm handsome?

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.502
I have no emotions, but I do have eyes.

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:18.506
What don't you have? Emotions?

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.551
You should be careful
not to get caught out by Min-ji.

00:29:21.634 --> 00:29:23.344
Her rules are even more intense.

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:25.764
Wait, who is Min-ji?

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.438
Excuse me.

00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:35.690
That's the ladies' restroom.

00:29:36.191 --> 00:29:37.525
I am a lady.

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.944
My apologies. I'm so sorry.

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:41.738
It's all right. I'm used to it.

00:30:00.173 --> 00:30:01.257
I'm a woman.

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:05.386
I know. You're the director
of Smile Dental Clinic.

00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:08.431
Do I know you?

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:15.063
Wait, I remember. I saw you
when I signed the lease for my clinic.

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:16.981
You're CEO Ryu Su-hyeon's assistant.

00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:20.151
Are you here to play golf?
Isn't this course great?

00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:22.362
I'll let him know.

00:30:22.904 --> 00:30:25.240
Mr. Ryu also owns this golf course.

00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:26.407
This too?

00:30:27.784 --> 00:30:32.413
Even with everything he could ask for,
he's always volunteering at the food bank.

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:35.124
He had another building
finished recently, right?

00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:49.347
The sold units will likely be occupied
from next week.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:50.557
Sounds good.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.225
I'm glad to hear you're happy.

00:30:52.725 --> 00:30:55.979
The paperwork's been a nightmare for me,
but it's good that you're satisfied.

00:30:57.564 --> 00:31:01.234
Why do you still scramble for money
when you already have so much?

00:31:04.487 --> 00:31:06.155
That's the thing about being human.

00:31:06.739 --> 00:31:09.117
You don't need to go to hell
to live in hell.

00:31:10.326 --> 00:31:12.370
Having no money is hell itself.

00:31:13.329 --> 00:31:14.873
Hell doesn't suit me.

00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:21.880
A nose rub?

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:24.507
At least you're still alive.

00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:26.050
For now, drink up.

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:28.136
Being away from home is tough.

00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:45.695
What is this aluminum kettle?

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:48.239
It's remarkable!

00:31:48.323 --> 00:31:51.618
You know about aluminum,
but you don't know what a can is?

00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:53.745
GOBLIN STATIONERY

00:31:53.828 --> 00:31:54.662
Wow, this…

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:56.581
Wait here for a short while.

00:31:56.664 --> 00:31:59.709
I'll be back as soon as
I finish my after-school helper gig.

00:31:59.792 --> 00:32:02.211
Hey. You shouldn't be helping people.

00:32:02.295 --> 00:32:05.006
You're Satan's mythical beast.
You should be ruining them.

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:07.675
Stop the infuriating nonsense.
Wait right here.

00:32:18.978 --> 00:32:19.896
What is this lamp?

00:32:23.024 --> 00:32:24.484
It's amazing.

00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:34.869
You're still at it?

00:32:35.578 --> 00:32:36.537
Please just go.

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:38.039
I'd like to go too,

00:32:39.082 --> 00:32:40.416
but I just can't stop.

00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:43.169
Next time, I want to be trapped in this.

00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:17.036
You stay right here.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.455
I'll take you on any day.

00:33:48.943 --> 00:33:50.903
Hey there. Excuse me?

00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:52.196
It's dangerous there.

00:33:56.909 --> 00:33:57.869
I know.

00:33:57.952 --> 00:34:00.621
Leave her alone.
She's as experienced as we are.

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:02.290
We see her on every trail we go on.

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:04.292
The young lady who picks up all the trash.

00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:06.627
Oh my, it's nice to meet you.

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:08.921
I've heard so much about you.

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:11.215
I know.

00:34:16.095 --> 00:34:17.805
What took you so long to get down?

00:34:18.931 --> 00:34:21.100
Why are you here?
How did you know I was here?

00:34:22.018 --> 00:34:25.063
I'm desperate. I just need 1,000 won.
It's the last time, I swear.

00:34:25.146 --> 00:34:28.441
You came all this way for 1,000 won?
Aren't you a genie?

00:34:28.524 --> 00:34:29.734
Magic yourself some money.

00:34:29.817 --> 00:34:32.278
Spirits can't make treasures
for their own use.

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.947
And do you really think
I came for 1,000 won?

00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:36.532
Make your three wishes.

00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:38.785
Do it now. Right here. This instant.

00:34:39.452 --> 00:34:40.328
Or give me 1,000.

00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:42.747
So you came for 1,000 won.

00:34:43.706 --> 00:34:47.126
But if this is the last time,
that means there was also a first.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.128
- Don't tell me--
- It was Pan-geum's money.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.673
You think that makes it okay?

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:56.594
Why are you so quick to wield a weapon?
Let's just talk this out!

00:34:56.677 --> 00:34:59.180
Get over here. You damn thief.

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:02.183
Give it back.
Give back my grandma's money!

00:35:11.275 --> 00:35:12.193
JUST 1,000 WON!

00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:13.194
JUST 1,000 WON!

00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:14.278
JUST 1,000 WON!

00:35:14.362 --> 00:35:15.321
JUST 1,000 WON!

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:36.926
Give it to me.

00:35:37.718 --> 00:35:39.137
I just want 1,000 won!

00:35:39.762 --> 00:35:40.847
You're dead meat.

00:35:44.267 --> 00:35:45.810
Hey, where are you going?

00:35:45.893 --> 00:35:48.312
Okay. Fine. I'll take 800,
and give you 200 change.

00:35:56.237 --> 00:36:00.449
Hey, you insane lump of clay!

00:36:01.033 --> 00:36:03.828
Your master did this, Master?
Why would she?

00:36:05.913 --> 00:36:07.456
I asked her for 1,000 won.

00:36:08.374 --> 00:36:12.003
- After all this, she didn't even pay up.
- Darn, my neck. 1,000 won?

00:36:13.212 --> 00:36:14.213
It's a thing.

00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:15.798
Of course it's a thing.

00:36:16.465 --> 00:36:17.967
I have a lot of those things.

00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:21.846
Why do you have money?

00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:23.931
Because I work part-time.

00:36:24.432 --> 00:36:28.853
So your master didn't give you any money
and even ran you over with her car?

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:30.229
So it's true.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.273
She must really be a psychopath.

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:33.316
Yeah, that thing!

00:36:33.399 --> 00:36:37.612
What is that, and why do people keep
calling her a "path"? A path to where?

00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:39.071
PSYCHOPATH

00:36:39.155 --> 00:36:41.449
It's not like some kind of path you take.

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:44.160
Don't be too alarmed
by the search results.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.536
Are you ready?

00:36:46.579 --> 00:36:47.413
No.

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:50.166
They're about to level up again.

00:36:53.502 --> 00:36:54.670
If they knew it was me--

00:36:57.798 --> 00:36:59.091
Oh, it's just you.

00:36:59.175 --> 00:37:00.801
You're getting funnier by the day.

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:02.470
Why did the monitor switch off?

00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:03.596
Here. Take a look.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:32.458
How shall I explain this feeling
of intense disappointment

00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:34.085
to my dear Ki Ka-young?

00:37:35.169 --> 00:37:39.799
How am I the last person to know
that you came back from Dubai with a man?

00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:41.425
What does this jerk do?

00:37:41.509 --> 00:37:45.012
What, has he got an oil well
in his backyard or something?

00:37:46.472 --> 00:37:48.808
I'm not quite sure
what he does for a living…

00:37:51.352 --> 00:37:53.646
but he tilted the earth to hug me.

00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:58.025
- He mostly tells me to make a wish.
- A wish?

00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:00.403
He's clearly a cult leader.

00:38:00.486 --> 00:38:04.323
Does he mention things like the end
or corruption? Does he ask you for money?

00:38:04.865 --> 00:38:07.493
- He does.
- See? I knew it. How much?

00:38:08.577 --> 00:38:09.412
A thousand.

00:38:09.495 --> 00:38:10.705
A thousand big ones?

00:38:11.914 --> 00:38:14.083
What a bastard. So?

00:38:14.166 --> 00:38:18.671
So I shoved him off a viewing platform,
beat him up a few times, and ran him over.

00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:24.427
You're all done.

00:38:26.595 --> 00:38:29.598
Settling all that
with 10 million won is a bargain.

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:31.684
It's done. You can go.

00:38:36.605 --> 00:38:38.733
I'll go wash up
before my next appointments.

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:39.817
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:38:42.028 --> 00:38:45.364
By the way, why does that lady
always get in the chair to talk?

00:38:45.448 --> 00:38:47.116
She doesn't even get checked.

00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:50.536
She likes the sound of dental scaling.

00:38:51.537 --> 00:38:52.496
Creepy.

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.333
I should have known.

00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:58.836
I threatened to throw her from high up,
and she loved every second.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.380
This was a losing battle all along.

00:39:02.131 --> 00:39:05.134
So corrupt. She's barely human.
There's nothing for me to corrupt.

00:39:05.217 --> 00:39:08.596
She was so righteous in her past lives.
What will we do now, Master?

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:11.515
I need to check one more thing.

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.937
Whether she values the lives of others.

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:20.941
Buy more of these aluminum kettles.

00:39:21.734 --> 00:39:23.235
The next one's to celebrate.

00:39:52.473 --> 00:39:53.891
What? Is that your lighter?

00:39:55.184 --> 00:39:57.436
Put it out.
This place is full of flammables.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.188
That comes down to you.

00:40:03.025 --> 00:40:04.902
Only you and I can put out this fire,

00:40:06.529 --> 00:40:07.488
but I won't.

00:40:09.365 --> 00:40:11.617
So the only way is if you wish for it.

00:40:52.992 --> 00:40:54.827
There's a fire! Call 911!

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:56.036
Call 911! Oh dear!

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.663
My gosh, it's a fire!

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.294
How far might these flames go?

00:41:04.253 --> 00:41:05.921
Are you filming a fire insurance ad?

00:41:06.672 --> 00:41:07.506
Open this.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:09.592
It may engulf the entire village

00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:11.427
or an entire city.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.930
Or perhaps the entire country.

00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:23.314
You just blew your chance.

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:26.358
As soon as I'm out of here,
I'll kill you first.

00:41:38.621 --> 00:41:41.499
Wait. There was another door?

00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:44.001
You should have done your research.

00:41:44.084 --> 00:41:45.586
No!

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:46.504
Don't!

00:41:46.587 --> 00:41:49.340
Do you know how to kill jerks

00:41:50.674 --> 00:41:52.051
who just won't die?

00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:54.845
By beating them to death.

00:42:03.395 --> 00:42:04.480
You crazy…

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:06.941
That hurts so bad!

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:10.444
The fire! Wish for the fire to be put out!

00:42:11.487 --> 00:42:13.614
Why should I? Just burn it all down.

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:16.909
I don't care if you want
to burn the entire earth!

00:42:16.992 --> 00:42:19.203
Then why are you beating me up?

00:42:19.286 --> 00:42:21.872
Because you disrupted
my after-work routine.

00:42:22.414 --> 00:42:23.541
On a Wednesday.

00:42:24.166 --> 00:42:25.251
What?

00:42:27.253 --> 00:42:28.462
Hold up!

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:38.681
Where is the fire?

00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:41.809
It was over there,

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.019
but it went out on its own.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:45.980
You see the scorch marks, right?

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:49.275
I definitely saw it too.
But it went out in an instant.

00:42:49.942 --> 00:42:53.070
First things first,
I think you should stop the assault.

00:42:53.153 --> 00:42:55.531
- Over there!
- Goodness! Ms. Ki!

00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:03.247
Ms. Ki!

00:43:05.207 --> 00:43:06.542
What on earth are you doing?

00:43:06.625 --> 00:43:08.836
You can't beat someone up like that!

00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:11.380
It's all good, sir.

00:43:11.463 --> 00:43:12.965
I'm not even a person,

00:43:13.966 --> 00:43:15.092
and I deserve it.

00:43:15.175 --> 00:43:17.386
Sir, I brought this on myself.

00:43:18.304 --> 00:43:19.763
Wait, your head.

00:43:19.847 --> 00:43:21.015
It's dented!

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:24.768
It's all right. It doesn't hurt at all.

00:43:25.311 --> 00:43:27.187
It'll bounce back if I flex my brain.

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.315
Wait, your arm's twisted too.

00:43:30.983 --> 00:43:32.109
Oh, this?

00:43:33.027 --> 00:43:34.820
It was like this when I got here.

00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:38.741
I'm good. Please be on your way.
Thank you for your concern.

00:43:38.824 --> 00:43:40.200
So you know how to be polite?

00:43:41.201 --> 00:43:43.162
So you knew how, but you chose not to.

00:43:45.414 --> 00:43:46.665
Hurry and stop her!

00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:48.292
Don't stop her!

00:43:48.375 --> 00:43:49.877
Everyone, just leave already!

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.128
She hits me.

00:43:53.005 --> 00:43:54.173
And then hits me again.

00:43:54.673 --> 00:43:56.050
We're getting along great.

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:58.886
Why are so many people getting involved?

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:02.014
Right, welcome to the modern day,
you ancient bozo.

00:44:03.057 --> 00:44:05.976
I'll let you off because I need to go
eat gamja-tang now.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.020
If things aren't back to normal
by midnight,

00:44:08.103 --> 00:44:11.690
I'll cut you into quarters
and ship you express to whoever made you,

00:44:11.774 --> 00:44:13.108
so get moving.

00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:14.985
I may have lost today, but I will--

00:44:20.949 --> 00:44:23.869
As expected, she doesn't care about
other people's lives.

00:44:24.703 --> 00:44:26.914
That was a highly successful attempt.

00:44:27.706 --> 00:44:31.168
You look like too much of a mess
to call it a success.

00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:33.212
It's all good.

00:44:34.213 --> 00:44:35.714
I always looked like a mess.

00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:39.176
I'm warning you. Lay a finger on me again,

00:44:39.259 --> 00:44:40.552
and I will wipe out…

00:44:40.636 --> 00:44:43.180
And to think, I made threats
that meant nothing to her.

00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:46.934
I underestimated a tough fight.

00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:50.562
I just need to do a little suffering.

00:44:51.146 --> 00:44:54.024
Were all of her shots aimed at your head?

00:44:58.028 --> 00:45:00.197
SA FAMILY GAMJA-TANG

00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:03.450
You went through all that fire and flood,

00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:06.078
and you're still downing gamja-tang?

00:45:06.161 --> 00:45:07.955
- It's Wednesday.
- That's right.

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:09.748
And while we're on the topic,

00:45:10.457 --> 00:45:12.209
can't we change up the menu?

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:13.961
The menu is fixed.

00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:16.588
This is my routine.
Our friendship routine.

00:45:16.672 --> 00:45:17.506
No, it's not.

00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:19.007
Listen carefully.

00:45:19.091 --> 00:45:21.760
In school, you beat up anyone
who messed with me, right?

00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:24.972
- Yes.
- You cared more for my grades than I did.

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:27.474
- Right.
- Let's say your grandma dies.

00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:29.393
- Who will you call?
- The village chief.

00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:32.604
Right. And after him?

00:45:32.688 --> 00:45:34.064
The ambulance.

00:45:34.148 --> 00:45:35.315
Correct.

00:45:37.025 --> 00:45:38.235
- And then?
- You.

00:45:38.318 --> 00:45:39.486
See?

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.030
This is friendship.
Seafood stew next week. Deal?

00:45:44.366 --> 00:45:45.659
I need to eat gamja-tang.

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:47.870
My rules and routines are absolute.

00:45:47.953 --> 00:45:50.539
Grandma is my rule,
and this is my routine.

00:45:50.622 --> 00:45:52.916
One misstep, and I'd be dangerous.

00:45:53.667 --> 00:45:56.295
We're not fighting.
Please enjoy your meals.

00:45:58.547 --> 00:45:59.840
You're wrong.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.884
You're not dangerous.

00:46:01.967 --> 00:46:04.428
You've already proven yourself.

00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:06.722
That's how it is now.

00:46:07.473 --> 00:46:10.851
But what if Grandma passes away?
Then my rules will disappear.

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:12.060
Without my rules,

00:46:12.978 --> 00:46:13.979
I might kill someone--

00:46:14.062 --> 00:46:15.689
I'm telling you, that's not true--

00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:17.566
Don't cut me off!

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.863
- I haven't told you my workshop story yet.
- Fine, tell me.

00:46:23.989 --> 00:46:25.741
It starts with "a coffin"? Right?

00:46:25.824 --> 00:46:27.367
A coffin?

00:46:28.869 --> 00:46:30.579
I've never built a coffin before, so…

00:46:30.662 --> 00:46:32.664
Shall we start trying today, then?

00:46:32.748 --> 00:46:33.874
Two paulownia coffins.

00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:36.752
You must be preparing coffins
for your dogs.

00:46:37.544 --> 00:46:39.797
Are they elderly? How big are they?

00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:43.091
Large dogs? Or small dogs?

00:46:45.928 --> 00:46:46.845
How tall are you?

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:50.641
She's about as tall as you are.
My grandma, not my dog.

00:46:51.767 --> 00:46:52.976
The other one is for me.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.395
I plan to die once she passes away.

00:46:57.731 --> 00:46:59.233
As natural a death as possible.

00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:01.318
I'm going for something

00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:05.155
like deep-sea equipment failure
or a fall on a remote trail.

00:47:05.906 --> 00:47:06.865
Do you understand?

00:47:06.949 --> 00:47:08.700
I understand, yeah.

00:47:10.077 --> 00:47:14.122
But must you tell me every time
when I'm the one who'll be most upset?

00:47:14.206 --> 00:47:16.750
Who else would I tell?
You're my only friend.

00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:17.835
Just don't be upset.

00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:20.128
Come on, that's…

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.758
Fine. I'll try not to let it get to me.

00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:29.012
But you would never kill someone.

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:34.685
That kind of blind faith
is friendship, isn't it?

00:47:34.768 --> 00:47:36.603
And I'm not capable of that.

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:37.855
You don't need to be.

00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:41.108
I still love you either way.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.235
So please,

00:47:43.986 --> 00:47:44.903
stop it.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.740
- I know.
- What the hell do you know?

00:47:49.283 --> 00:47:51.368
I don't know feelings,
but I know statistics.

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:54.079
Every Wednesday, I eat gamja-tang.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.624
You've had gamja-tang with me
twice every month for five years.

00:47:57.708 --> 00:48:01.169
You say you don't want to come,
but you never let me eat alone.

00:48:01.753 --> 00:48:04.506
You come and erase the line
that separates me, a negative,

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:06.300
and all the normal zeroes.

00:48:07.175 --> 00:48:08.135
Right.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.220
That's got to be love.

00:48:16.351 --> 00:48:18.395
Keep eating. I'll get us some water.

00:48:32.784 --> 00:48:33.869
What the…

00:48:34.828 --> 00:48:35.913
What's wrong with this?

00:48:36.955 --> 00:48:38.081
Why are you here?

00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:39.041
What?

00:48:39.666 --> 00:48:42.753
Don't tell me you were spying on me
from the water filter.

00:48:42.836 --> 00:48:46.173
I've straightened up the garage.
Thought you'd want to know.

00:48:47.007 --> 00:48:48.091
Damn it.

00:48:49.217 --> 00:48:51.845
Who was it? Did someone say something?

00:48:52.512 --> 00:48:54.473
We're not fighting, I swear.

00:48:55.807 --> 00:48:56.767
Enjoy your meal.

00:48:58.518 --> 00:48:59.394
Again?

00:49:03.398 --> 00:49:04.441
That's 4,000 won.

00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:05.817
You're into that?

00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:08.445
I'm catering to your tastes.

00:49:09.696 --> 00:49:10.530
Follow me.

00:49:11.031 --> 00:49:13.200
- Here you are.
- I'll take that. Thank you.

00:49:20.415 --> 00:49:21.416
Take this.

00:49:23.085 --> 00:49:26.964
From now on, when only I can see you,
you wear this clip as a sign.

00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:30.550
I'm strange enough as it is.
I don't need to be any stranger.

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:32.052
You may have no need, but I do.

00:49:32.886 --> 00:49:35.889
If you want me to wear this,
you should at least make an effort.

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:38.475
The least you could do
is make your first wish.

00:49:41.853 --> 00:49:46.233
Why are you so hung up on those wishes?
Why do you want to kill me so badly?

00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:51.989
There's no point telling you
since you don't even remember,

00:49:52.698 --> 00:49:55.701
but it's because you trapped me
in a lamp for 983 years.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:57.661
Do you have proof?

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:01.665
It was you.

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:07.421
I watched as your flesh decayed
and your bones turned to dust.

00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.506
I have a handful of that dirt too.

00:50:11.133 --> 00:50:13.218
I'll admit tempting you is a challenge,

00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:17.347
but once you make a wish,
you will certainly become more corrupt.

00:50:18.473 --> 00:50:20.684
If the corruption of humans is guaranteed,

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:24.688
people wouldn't have categorized me
as a psychopath or a threat.

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:28.442
I've never even jaywalked or littered.

00:50:29.776 --> 00:50:32.070
My grandma says humans are kind beings.

00:50:32.154 --> 00:50:33.864
I am the only evil in the world.

00:50:36.116 --> 00:50:37.284
So you're wrong.

00:50:40.495 --> 00:50:41.329
No.

00:50:42.289 --> 00:50:44.916
I granted the wishes of humans
for thousands of years.

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.961
All humans end up corrupt
in one way or another.

00:50:48.837 --> 00:50:50.213
Then prove it to me.

00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:55.260
What in the world can I prove
in the middle of a street?

00:51:00.223 --> 00:51:01.058
Best of five.

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:03.602
You will grant the wishes

00:51:03.685 --> 00:51:06.063
of the next five
we meet here on this road.

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:09.024
And if more than three of them
can be corrupted,

00:51:09.775 --> 00:51:12.903
then I'll immediately make all my wishes
and die at your hands.

00:51:14.654 --> 00:51:16.323
My grandma never lies.

00:51:23.371 --> 00:51:25.749
Do you realize
what you've just put on the line?

00:51:26.708 --> 00:51:28.043
Are you really not afraid?

00:51:28.126 --> 00:51:31.922
Sorry, but I don't know how to be afraid.
So take this and do the work.

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:34.424
In the meantime, I'll be coming up with

00:51:34.508 --> 00:51:37.511
two perfect wishes
that won't have a single flaw.

00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:38.804
Why only two wishes?

00:51:40.097 --> 00:51:41.223
I already made one.

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:42.891
My first wish.

00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:45.185
Which is?

00:51:46.728 --> 00:51:48.313
I told you to prove it to me.

00:51:48.814 --> 00:51:50.982
Prove that humans are bound to be corrupt.

00:51:52.275 --> 00:51:53.610
This is my first wish.

00:52:00.325 --> 00:52:01.993
I've been tempted by you.

00:55:41.212 --> 00:55:47.052

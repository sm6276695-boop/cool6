GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:08.485
I told you to prove it to me.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.071
Prove that humans are bound to be corrupt.

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:13.073
This is my first wish.

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:17.660
I've been tempted by you.

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.041
You'd bet your life
on something as fragile…

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.628
as the goodness of humanity?

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:28.463
This is unbelievable.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.384
You will lose no matter what.
Just wait and see.

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:36.304
I'll see to it that you lose.
You'll be begging me to please--

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:38.056
Save it for when you actually win.

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:40.266
And wear this.

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:44.896
No, I'm going to celebrate early.

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:47.816
I decide when to do what.

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:52.112
Get a move on, human.
Spring nights are short.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:58.576
If you were, in fact,
locked up for 983 years,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.912
how are you the most famous genie?

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:04.874
I was famous even before I was locked up
for defying his orders.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.209
Why did you do that?

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:08.419
You've tempted me.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:09.587
I was tempted… No.

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.760
I refused to bow my head
to a lowly human molded from clay.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.846
- Look, 1,000 won!
- Where?

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.060
I was just tying my laces.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.151
Take your time tying them.

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:33.945
Tie them to your heart's content.

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:37.866
I swear I'll corrupt you,

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.702
even if it's the last thing I do.

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:42.954
I will wring your neck, you hear?

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:46.624
I'll hang your head
at the gates of hell, and…

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:48.918
Is that you, Ka-young?

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.093
Here comes the first human
to be corrupted.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:59.721
I should come by for an oil change.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.599
I'll stop by on my next day off.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.267
Sure. Come by.

00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:10.106
Kang Im-seon. A supermarket employee
and Granny An's eldest daughter-in-law.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:12.859
I know that kind of face well.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.112
The face of someone
who wants the world to end tomorrow.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.993
Gu Bo-gyeong.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:26.164
A bank employee.
We were classmates until high school.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:33.755
Did you get a text from the bank
about our new towel sets?

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:38.843
I'm sure you use nicer ones, but still.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:45.225
- Are you going somewhere?
- I'm not. Go ahead.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:46.142
What?

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.144
Okay.

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.319
I know that kind of face well too.

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:59.405
The face of someone who wants
the world to end as soon as today.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:07.205
So two are confirmed for corruption.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.507
Another familiar face, I see.

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:20.802
What, do I not smell like
I belong in this neighborhood?

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.303
Do I reek of oil?

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.892
It's barking at you.
Did you take the hair clip out?

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.311
Take a look.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.190
Dogs are spiritual animals,
so they can see me in any form.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.359
Really? Paw-sitively fascinating.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.946
Of all the village dogs,
this one barks at me the most.

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:41.614
Really?

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.742
I guess that makes you
tonight's third wishmaker.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.744
Nice to meet you, mutt.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.415
What a load of dog shit.
Dogs aren't included.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:53.626
Why not?

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.046
You said the first five
we meet on this road.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.049
That should include all living beings.
Those are the rules.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.302
Don't you agree,
Ki Ka-young, lover of rules?

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.723
THIS WAY TO CHEONGPUNG VILLAGE HALL

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:11.311
Ms. Ki?

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:13.479
Where are you headed this late?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.190
It's dangerous to be out alone at night.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:18.109
Need a lift?

00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:19.068
No, thanks.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.988
I'm not alone, and I'm meeting someone.

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.244
Is that so? Take care, then.

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.085
Eom Sang-tae.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.672
You know the gamja-tang spot?
He's the son of Granny Sa, the owner.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:43.718
Eom Sang-tae must not know
that you're the truly dangerous one here.

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:46.512
Of course he does.
The entire village knows about me.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:50.224
But he probably doesn't know what I know.

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:55.438
Yikes, you scared me.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.359
You must be out on a walk

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:01.194
in the dead of night.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.654
How's your YouTube channel doing?

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.741
- Is Da-jin well?
- Choi Da-jin, lock the doors!

00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:07.992
Only joking.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.745
Good night, then.

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:18.628
I guess it must have been
about a year ago.

00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:21.339
He moved here for the farm life.

00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:23.716
He and his wife run a YouTube channel.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.260
So I guess we have our five.

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:28.137
It's the best of five.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.181
I'll make it a clean sweep.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:32.767
You'll see it in no time.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.519
Those five will hit rock bottom.

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:37.939
And that bottom is quite deep.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.817
Humans only realize their true colors

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.903
when faced with the prospect of wishes.

00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:45.863
Is that so?

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.658
And what does my wish say about me?

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.577
That you're a psychopath.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.041
With a single wish, you led
four humans and a creature to corruption.

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:02.296
And I forgot to mention something.

00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:06.175
There are both good and evil genies.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.887
Of them, there is one who conjures hell.

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:12.515
They call him

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:13.850
"Iblis"

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.811
or "Shaytan."

00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:20.106
To use a name you may recognize…

00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:23.359
it's "Satan."

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.531
It appears as though…

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:32.869
I have encountered an evil genie.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.547
What are you going to do now?

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:29.967
Even in this life,
she used her first wish selflessly.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.595
It wasn't exactly selfless, was it?

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:35.932
She bet her life on people being kind.
What else is that but selflessness?

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.100
And what did you call her? "A psychopath"?

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.186
"I am Satan"?
What's with the sudden honesty?

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.688
So the rats are
surprisingly accurate informants.

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:48.736
I just didn't want to lose.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.072
What should I do?

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:53.824
Maybe I should just skip this life?

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.702
Ki Ka-young will live until 80 at most.

00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:02.208
With this lamp and those aluminum kettles,
those years should fly by.

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:04.126
And how would you fund that habit?

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:07.213
Yes, good plan. Let's just skip this life.

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:09.507
For now, I'll try my best to avoid her.

00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:12.552
You go get a job at her auto shop
and gather some intel.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:13.469
What do you think?

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.722
Right, so you'll be using my money.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.267
But where will you hide, Master?

00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:24.313
Somewhere very far away from here.

00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:26.899
Somewhere closer to him.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.160
Come on out. Let's eat.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:39.579
No, I was just rushing out…

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.707
Hey, that!
I know the perfect place to eat that.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.543
And don't tell Ka-young that you saw me.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:12.778
How delicious.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.496
What? Status report?

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.333
I have just spotted
an unidentified flying object!

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:28.502
I see a carpet. Over!

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:33.549
He's eating bibimbap. Over.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.135
What are you talking about?
Give me a proper report!

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:44.393
What's the matter?

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:45.478
Come on, what is it?

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:50.775
Oh, did you two arrange to meet here?

00:10:51.859 --> 00:10:53.569
He's escaping. Awaiting orders. Over.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.488
Should we shoot him down? Over!

00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:57.990
At around 3:38 p.m. today,

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:01.619
the Ministry of National Defense
reported an unidentified flying object

00:11:01.702 --> 00:11:05.498
near the Korea-Japan maritime border,
which prompted a fighter jet standoff.

00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:09.585
They avoided providing specific details
regarding the unidentified flying object.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.051
I guess I've identified
the unidentified flying object.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:19.387
With my very eyes.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.806
I needed some time to myself
to mull things over.

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:23.974
Shut it.

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:26.811
You almost sparked a war
between two countries,

00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:29.313
then tucked into an in-flight meal?

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:31.190
Bibimbap!

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.610
Ms. Ki. You're hiring, aren't you?

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.368
Please hire me for the job.

00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:44.495
I was practically raised
on rice and engines.

00:11:44.578 --> 00:11:47.373
Why don't you avoid

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:50.292
talking about rice today?

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:54.839
Did you two plan something?

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.092
You clearly know each other.

00:12:04.306 --> 00:12:06.058
You said you'd stay hidden.

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.352
How can you get caught
in less than 12 hours?

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.938
Don't worry. I have a plan.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.692
I need a change in direction.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.570
Half a day in, and you're doing this here?

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.324
Why did Ki Ka-young die for them
when she had no interest in dying for me?

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.452
What makes me different from them?

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:27.163
I should've checked that.

00:12:28.372 --> 00:12:29.290
I'll be back.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.419
Where are you off to now?

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:38.132
Comrades.

00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:39.258
OCTOBER, 1909
PRIMORSKY KRAI

00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:41.677
Let us meet again
at Harbin Station. Alive.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:43.262
Yes.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.143
Ki Ka-young?

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.314
Who are you?

00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:54.774
Hi, past-life Ki Ka-young.

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:56.525
I need to ask you something.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:59.445
Know of An Jung-geun?

00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:01.572
Comrades!

00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:04.658
Our location has been compromised!
Run, now! Hurry!

00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:08.329
So you are a spy.

00:13:08.412 --> 00:13:09.371
A spy?

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:10.873
What's that?

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:13.167
No, I just have a question.

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:17.630
Fire!

00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:20.966
So loud. No, stop!

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.597
Come on, that stings!

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.308
Hey! We were talking over here!

00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:30.851
What do you keep throwing at me?

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.570
I was only trying to return them to you.
Right, Ki Ka-young.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.907
Where are you going? Wait for me!

00:13:45.407 --> 00:13:47.827
I said I have a question.
I swear it won't take long!

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.247
Thanks for saving me.

00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:54.375
If we are granted another life,

00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:56.710
I hope we meet again.

00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:59.547
Wait, no.
I want to talk to you in this life…

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.340
Get him first!

00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:02.675
Fire!

00:14:02.758 --> 00:14:03.884
That stings!

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:05.970
Stop giving me these things!

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.140
- There he is!
- Right, Ki Ka-young.

00:14:10.224 --> 00:14:11.350
Wait, I…

00:14:11.892 --> 00:14:13.561
This life just won't do.

00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:22.027
THE YEAR 1592

00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:33.372
A messenger is here
from Jeolla's naval command.

00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:34.290
Let him in.

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:40.504
- You may approach.
- Yes, sir.

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:47.011
Ki Ka-young.

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:55.269
Ki Ka-young.

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:58.898
- What was that?
- What was that sound just now?

00:14:58.981 --> 00:14:59.899
You're a man now?

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:12.745
Ki Ka-young. I have a question for you.

00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:13.704
Your Majesty.

00:15:13.787 --> 00:15:17.166
I, Yi Sun-sin, Left Naval Commander
of Jeolla Province, humbly report.

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:20.127
Yes. It's about that man, Yi Sun-sin.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.464
Our forces struck Busan Port's
enemy base, sinking 130 ships…

00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:24.757
- Ki Ka-young.
- Ki Ka-young.

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:28.844
No, kicking, no, killing…

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.429
Command my death, Your Majesty.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.390
Who was that? Come on out.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.852
Who keeps going on about "Ki Ka-young"?

00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:44.735
Goodness, how can this be?

00:15:44.818 --> 00:15:45.778
What is that?

00:15:47.404 --> 00:15:48.530
Who is that?

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:49.990
Is he a person or a ghost?

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:51.909
I have a pressing question, you see.

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.663
That peculiar, freakish…

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:59.458
Seize that monstrous being
and decapitate it at once!

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:01.669
Decapitate?

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:04.546
What does that mean?

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.635
And so, it was recorded
in one unofficial Joseon text

00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:13.722
that the being stayed alive
for three days even after being beheaded

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:17.142
and, for all three days,
continued its bizarre cries,

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:22.815
saying "Kay Young, Kay Young"
before vanishing into thin air.

00:16:25.609 --> 00:16:26.610
Where have you been?

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:28.153
Far away.

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:39.957
There were some people
I needed to meet up with.

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:43.252
What the hell are you playing at?

00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:46.588
I made a wish like you wanted.
Why aren't you doing any work?

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:49.425
You're just stalling for time, aren't you?

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:50.926
Not at all!

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.597
I've arranged it so that the lamp
will show itself when their desire peaks.

00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:01.812
But if someone's wish changes things,
how would I know?

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:02.771
What about that?

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.404
Once you write with this pen,

00:17:10.487 --> 00:17:13.532
your words are eternally binding,
no matter how things may change?

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:16.702
And we're here to get it?
At the crack of dawn?

00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:18.328
Yes. It'll be right here.

00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:21.081
But the process is complicated,

00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:24.251
and I'll need your help.

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:35.262
He owns this building.
Did you get permission to be up here?

00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:37.890
Between us,
permission will never be necessary.

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:41.226
Pluck a feather while he's distracted.

00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:43.771
Then run.

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:46.565
What?

00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:50.944
Why, you…

00:17:55.282 --> 00:17:57.367
This is so much fun!

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:18.263
Are you okay?

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.140
Yes, well, I'm fine.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.228
Why were you screaming
when you have wings?

00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:26.480
I was just nervous
since it's been a while.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.649
Is your auto shop doing well?

00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:29.900
You could say that.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.612
Anyway, you'll feel a pinch.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.742
Damn it!
I'm already stressed from molting.

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:41.328
Hey! How many did you pluck?

00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:45.624
Long time no see, brother.

00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:49.378
I heard you got out, brother.

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:51.171
It's been, what, almost 1,000 years?

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:55.217
So, in my absence,
was the world full of peace and quiet?

00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:58.804
You condemned me,
saying I led humans astray.

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:02.683
So tell me. In a world without me,
were all humans kind?

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:07.062
I've seen that war, murder, greed,
and selfishness all continued to exist,

00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:09.148
even in my absence.

00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:11.316
Ever think they're the seeds you sowed?

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.445
The idea of humans getting a chance
to make a wish is just wrong.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.407
- Hasn't it ever occurred to you?
- No, it hasn't.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.658
All that occurs to me

00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:22.536
is how those flawed lumps of clay
are his mistake.

00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:25.164
Proving that hell is fitting
for those lumps of clay

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.791
is the task that he bestowed upon me.

00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:30.377
Don't forget that
he also bestowed me with a task.

00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:34.089
I'm pretty sure you took from my wing
before you were locked up.

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:35.674
What are you up to this time?

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:36.884
Never you mind.

00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:38.927
While I was locked up,

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:42.306
for 983 years
without skipping a single day,

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:45.726
you came to visit the desert
where I was locked up

00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:48.854
and poured a handful of sand over my lamp.

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:50.689
Was it heavy?

00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:54.151
You ought to experience
the burdens humans live with.

00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:57.654
My goodness.
You really are an angel, aren't you?

00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:02.367
Enough chitchat. Let's truly catch up.

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.412
If you wish.
Though, this will be the last time.

00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:08.665
I'll be coming for your throat soon.

00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:24.431
Wait, where did he go?

00:20:55.128 --> 00:20:56.296
Hey! Damn you!

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:02.094
Are you nuts?
Did you just bust through my building?

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:05.514
All the units are sold,
and everyone's due to move in next week!

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:08.642
Any idea what this building's worth?

00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:09.643
Let's see.

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:12.980
Would it be worth
the weight of your hypocrisy?

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:13.981
Why, you little!

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:17.693
For a second there,
I almost forgot you were Satan.

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:20.195
Is it hitting home now?

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.408
You better watch your back,

00:21:25.075 --> 00:21:26.952
for I have returned, brother.

00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:32.958
That damn little…

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:54.229
It can only write truths?

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:04.489
WRITTEN BY KI KA-YOUNG

00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:08.744
A NEGATIVE ONE AND A STONE IN A SHOE

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:19.212
GENIE HAS GOOD LOOKS

00:22:20.922 --> 00:22:21.757
It works.

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:24.051
GENIE HAS LOOKS

00:22:24.634 --> 00:22:26.803
Wow. Brutal.

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:34.436
I AM

00:22:37.647 --> 00:22:40.400
I AM GRANDMA'S BURDEN

00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:45.697
I AM GRANDMA'S STRENGTH

00:22:54.122 --> 00:22:55.540
Ka-young.

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.209
Try some of these.

00:22:57.834 --> 00:23:01.880
Chang-sik dropped off a huge basketful,
and they're incredibly sweet.

00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:06.510
- Grandma.
- Yes?

00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:10.347
All this time,
I've been fooled by everyone.

00:23:10.847 --> 00:23:12.974
I'm not a burden to you, Grandma.

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:14.810
I'm your strength.

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:15.936
Goodness me.

00:23:16.019 --> 00:23:19.147
You must not be all that smart
if you're only just figuring that out.

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:21.024
I guess being first doesn't mean much.

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.111
Eat up. It'll give you strength.

00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:31.576
Actually, Grandma,
strawberries have vitamin C, not strength.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:35.539
For strength, you want to consume
a primary energy source, like carbs…

00:23:35.622 --> 00:23:36.456
Grandma?

00:23:49.219 --> 00:23:52.180
Seriously, what's going on
in that head of yours?

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:53.765
Aren't you going to do any work?

00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:57.018
- Gonna sell the strawberries next year?
- Aye, ma'am!

00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:58.395
It's no big deal.

00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.272
It wasn't mutual.

00:24:01.648 --> 00:24:02.774
It was one-sided.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.276
By the way,

00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:08.071
I heard that men in the Middle East
really do rub noses like that.

00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:11.867
I hear they only do that to dignitaries
whom they deeply respect.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.618
What, so I'm a dignitary?

00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:14.661
I guess so.

00:24:23.837 --> 00:24:25.255
You're the only one for me!

00:24:25.338 --> 00:24:28.300
Peace has been restored
to our briefly rattled family!

00:24:28.383 --> 00:24:29.968
Sure, all right.

00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:33.805
What kind of fresh bullcrap is this?

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:37.225
Didn't you say there was a draw
to assign festival booths?

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:39.478
- Get to work, will you?
- Aye, ma'am!

00:24:40.395 --> 00:24:44.065
Please do your best to keep sales steady
during the festival period.

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:45.859
Our branch manager is very concerned.

00:24:45.942 --> 00:24:49.404
Pay closer attention to the displays
and offer samples proactively.

00:24:49.488 --> 00:24:51.281
Yes, ma'am.

00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:52.991
Ms. Kang Im-seon?

00:24:53.783 --> 00:24:55.869
I've told you multiple times
to wear makeup.

00:24:56.369 --> 00:24:58.079
And remove that pain relief patch.

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:02.083
Hello?

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.793
Answer me, please.

00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:05.545
Yes, Assistant Manager Lee.

00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:24.981
What's this?

00:25:26.566 --> 00:25:28.527
I didn't know we sold anything like this.

00:25:58.473 --> 00:25:59.474
What is that?

00:26:00.517 --> 00:26:02.852
I am Genie, the lamp spirit.

00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:05.855
I shall grant you three wishes.

00:26:08.858 --> 00:26:09.693
Make them.

00:26:11.861 --> 00:26:13.405
No bringing back the dead.

00:26:14.322 --> 00:26:15.574
No traveling to the future.

00:26:16.324 --> 00:26:19.828
Anything besides that, your wish…

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:23.456
is my command.

00:26:32.966 --> 00:26:34.509
She made her first wish?

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.098
I get what the negative one means,

00:26:41.725 --> 00:26:43.184
but what's with the stone?

00:26:44.227 --> 00:26:46.479
- There's always something.
- Not your concern.

00:26:47.522 --> 00:26:49.524
So what did Ms. Kang wish for?

00:26:55.989 --> 00:27:00.910
{\an8}KANG IM-SEON, SUPERMARKET EMPLOYEE

00:27:00.994 --> 00:27:07.626
{\an8}APRIL 19, 2024, MADE HER FIRST WISH

00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:11.671
{\an8}I'm Kang Im-seon,
your newly appointed branch manager.

00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:14.883
{\an8}TO BECOME BRANCH MANAGER

00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:18.470
I've worked
at this supermarket for 20 years,

00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:21.222
since the year after it opened.

00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:22.807
But that young brat

00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:25.769
landed assistant manager
just by having a college degree.

00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:28.355
I'm still just a temp.

00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:33.318
Make me that bitch's superior officer.

00:27:33.902 --> 00:27:35.028
The branch manager.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.115
That is my first wish.

00:27:44.954 --> 00:27:47.666
Oh boy. Good for you, Im-seon.

00:27:48.249 --> 00:27:50.001
She worked so hard.

00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:51.836
Congratulations.

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:55.590
Assistant Manager Lee?

00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:58.426
You'll work the frozen goods
discount display today.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.511
Me?

00:28:00.428 --> 00:28:02.764
You never seem satisfied
with the employees' work.

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:05.350
And wear a lighter shade of lipstick.

00:28:05.433 --> 00:28:07.894
Stop wafting your perfume
around the tasting stations.

00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:11.231
Hello?

00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:14.234
Answer me, please!

00:28:16.444 --> 00:28:18.405
Yes, Branch Manager Kang.

00:28:21.908 --> 00:28:24.160
All right, then. Let's open our doors.

00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:25.870
Yes, ma'am.

00:28:27.622 --> 00:28:29.499
What on earth is going on?

00:28:29.999 --> 00:28:33.753
I know. How can a temp employee
become branch manager overnight?

00:28:34.254 --> 00:28:35.380
How did that happen?

00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:36.965
Who knows?

00:28:39.592 --> 00:28:41.052
You're due for an oil change.

00:28:41.636 --> 00:28:43.388
I am, aren't I?

00:28:44.806 --> 00:28:45.765
Actually,

00:28:46.516 --> 00:28:47.976
I'll be getting a new car.

00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:49.477
An imported one.

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:51.479
Don't you worry about me anymore.

00:28:56.943 --> 00:28:58.319
Are you seeing it now?

00:28:58.945 --> 00:29:00.530
The true nature of humanity?

00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:03.116
One thing I definitely didn't know.

00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:04.993
That I'd lose a client.

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:08.913
But is it okay for you
to be seen with me like this?

00:29:08.997 --> 00:29:12.959
The wishmakers know you're a genie.
Shouldn't you avoid being seen with me?

00:29:14.878 --> 00:29:17.213
In their eyes, I'm a mere sand whirl.

00:29:18.214 --> 00:29:21.009
But I tend to emit a golden light
to appear more mystical.

00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:23.595
There's no real functional purpose.

00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:29.184
Min-ji tends to wear a gown
to appear more like a dentist.

00:29:30.518 --> 00:29:32.937
If one holds a syringe without a gown on…

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.152
You're really gonna cut it off there?

00:29:39.652 --> 00:29:41.404
Wow. You're evil.

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:47.952
I've been itching to know for ages.
Who even is this Min-ji?

00:29:49.996 --> 00:29:52.207
Would you move
your damn head, Choi Min-ji?

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.084
I can't see the psychopath's head
because of you.

00:29:57.921 --> 00:30:00.799
So, do you really have the urge
to kill people and stuff?

00:30:01.925 --> 00:30:03.301
In gruesome ways?

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.096
I did just now.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.264
Just now?

00:30:09.098 --> 00:30:11.226
Damn, I almost pissed myself.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:12.811
Getting hit hurts.

00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:15.230
She might not say it,
but it still physically hurts.

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:17.023
Did she fucking say "physically"?

00:30:17.732 --> 00:30:20.902
That's why we hit her, dumbass.
So it hurts.

00:30:24.405 --> 00:30:26.157
You do that even though you know?

00:30:26.741 --> 00:30:28.701
You know the rules, yet you still hit her?

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:30.495
You don't hold back?

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:36.125
This is fucking boring.

00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:38.837
Hey, let's finish this smoke and bounce.

00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:52.016
What the fuck? I smell gasoline.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.310
It fucking reeks of gasoline.

00:30:54.394 --> 00:30:56.604
You fucking bitch.
What the hell are you doing?

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.022
Setting this place on fire.

00:30:58.106 --> 00:31:00.483
The story will be
you started the fire while smoking.

00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:02.819
Do we look like dipshits to you,
you psycho bitch?

00:31:02.902 --> 00:31:04.279
There are so many witnesses--

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.114
- Fuck!
- Damn it!

00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:07.949
So?

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:10.743
Shall I eliminate the witnesses, then?

00:31:12.453 --> 00:31:14.914
Okay, we get it. Fine. We won't touch you.

00:31:14.998 --> 00:31:18.543
Don't touch Choi Min-ji either.
This is our new rule.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:20.420
Fine.

00:31:26.175 --> 00:31:27.093
Be my friend.

00:31:27.176 --> 00:31:29.178
We're the only ones
who don't have friends.

00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:33.224
In South Korea, it's far more efficient
to be in a pair than alone.

00:31:34.017 --> 00:31:36.102
What happens if I say I don't want to?

00:31:36.185 --> 00:31:37.604
You don't have a choice.

00:31:37.687 --> 00:31:40.148
That's why, starting today,
you and I are friends.

00:31:41.024 --> 00:31:42.609
Also, your grades suck.

00:31:43.443 --> 00:31:44.527
Memorize all of this.

00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:46.112
If you don't, I'll kill you.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.949
Solve these, or I'll kill you.

00:31:52.118 --> 00:31:54.370
Pass the interview and oral exam.

00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:56.122
If you don't, I'll kill you.

00:31:56.205 --> 00:31:57.832
That's what I needed to hear.

00:31:58.416 --> 00:31:59.918
You have no other choice.

00:32:00.835 --> 00:32:02.128
Pass, Choi Min-ji!

00:32:02.211 --> 00:32:05.006
ODD TEETH AND ODD PEOPLE WELCOME

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:07.550
That's so funny.
It says, "Odd people welcome."

00:32:07.634 --> 00:32:09.636
- How ridiculous.
- Tell me about it.

00:32:09.719 --> 00:32:13.431
In my experience,
it's the odd ones who change the world.

00:32:14.223 --> 00:32:17.018
One of the wishmakers
from Ms. Ki Ka-young's first wish

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:18.811
has made their first wish.

00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:21.481
Today's Cheongpung
is not the same as yesterday's.

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:23.733
Congratulations, Master.

00:32:24.651 --> 00:32:27.612
If we steer Ms. Ki Ka-young's
last two wishes the right way,

00:32:27.695 --> 00:32:30.907
you'll at last be able to do
what you've longed for.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:32.200
Slit Iblis's throat.

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:34.410
So that's what they wanted my wing for.

00:32:34.494 --> 00:32:35.370
To keep a record.

00:32:37.538 --> 00:32:40.833
You know it took me 20 years
to study psychopaths, don't you?

00:32:41.417 --> 00:32:44.420
I actually thought Ki Ka-young
wouldn't make any wishes.

00:32:44.504 --> 00:32:48.716
For now, I'm happy that I've caught
a lucky break, but something feels off.

00:32:49.592 --> 00:32:52.804
I tossed all my books, but maybe
I'm not done researching psychopaths.

00:32:53.763 --> 00:32:55.723
Anyway, what's Iblis up to these days?

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:57.558
Canned beer and video game machines.

00:32:59.602 --> 00:33:01.813
- Think he'll show up when he's broke?
- Yes.

00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:04.065
He's using Sade's money right now.

00:33:04.565 --> 00:33:07.902
Hate comments have been flooding
the foundation's website since yesterday.

00:33:08.403 --> 00:33:10.947
Judging by the typos and content,
they're clearly written

00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:12.949
by Iblis.

00:33:13.032 --> 00:33:14.575
BEAUTIFUL RYU SU-HYEON. RESPECT!

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:15.952
ANON: WHY? ARE YOU STOOPID?

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.423
No!

00:33:29.298 --> 00:33:30.633
Please, no!

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:35.722
Sang-hyeok found money when he did this.

00:33:46.649 --> 00:33:47.608
Hey, human.

00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:53.322
Who? Me?

00:33:57.452 --> 00:33:58.286
What do you want?

00:33:59.162 --> 00:34:00.079
Pick it up.

00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:01.873
The Earth is hurting.

00:34:01.956 --> 00:34:04.083
Even Ki Ka-young picks up after herself.

00:34:05.334 --> 00:34:06.377
The Earth?

00:34:08.087 --> 00:34:08.921
It's hurting?

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:12.091
I guess today's my lucky day.

00:34:19.974 --> 00:34:22.351
I'm gonna toss this one too.
Infuriating, isn't it?

00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:23.561
Then hit me.

00:34:23.644 --> 00:34:24.854
Wow.

00:34:25.938 --> 00:34:26.898
I almost swooned.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.527
Any other day, you'd be exactly my type,

00:34:32.028 --> 00:34:33.112
but not today.

00:34:33.196 --> 00:34:34.572
Sade!

00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:41.913
Yes, Master.

00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:45.208
What the heck? Where'd you show up from?

00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:46.709
Take care of him for me.

00:34:47.293 --> 00:34:49.128
And hand over any spare change you have.

00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:53.758
That was incredibly smooth.

00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:57.595
Keep glaring at me. I dare you.

00:35:03.142 --> 00:35:06.687
Come on, bring it. Just so you know,
touch me, and I'll demand a settlement.

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:07.647
Got it?

00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:14.112
Don't come any closer!

00:35:17.907 --> 00:35:19.617
Back off! Don't come any closer!

00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:23.454
What are you going to do
about the 1,800 won I lost because of you?

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.458
Nice going.

00:35:27.542 --> 00:35:28.501
Irem!

00:35:30.169 --> 00:35:33.214
How long has it been? 100 years?

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:37.093
Excuse me. Have you seen a girl
who looks like this?

00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:45.184
Irem!

00:35:46.602 --> 00:35:50.606
So you've been here
the whole time since then?

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:55.653
Yes. Ejllael decided to settle here.
Death ran rampant back then.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:59.490
They said it was black,
so keep an eye out.

00:35:59.574 --> 00:36:02.410
- Okay.
- Shouldn't we search during the day?

00:36:06.455 --> 00:36:08.124
Who goes there? Who are you?

00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:11.002
Is that Director Ryu's assistant
and Mr. Seo I-deuk?

00:36:11.085 --> 00:36:13.671
This isn't the time or place
for a rendezvous.

00:36:13.754 --> 00:36:17.091
A panther or whatever was spotted
in town, and everyone's on edge.

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:19.677
Are you sure
it's a panther and not a jaguar--

00:36:20.386 --> 00:36:21.262
A jaguar?

00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:24.599
It's probably hiding in the mountains,
so let's head back down now.

00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:26.392
- It's dangerous. Go on.
- Sure, thanks.

00:36:26.475 --> 00:36:27.393
Hurry along.

00:36:27.977 --> 00:36:29.061
Goodbye.

00:36:29.145 --> 00:36:29.979
Go.

00:36:30.688 --> 00:36:31.689
Hold on a second.

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:34.859
That tail…

00:36:37.653 --> 00:36:38.487
and those ears.

00:36:42.325 --> 00:36:44.076
We went to Everland today.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.162
They're hot off the shelf.
Aren't they cute?

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.541
Is that right? I must say,
they're so realistic. Go on.

00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:52.126
Hurry along.

00:36:55.671 --> 00:36:57.715
Grr… Roar.

00:36:58.424 --> 00:37:00.343
Shall we hear about
what happened overnight?

00:37:00.426 --> 00:37:04.639
I would rather die an honorable death
than submit to my mortal enemy.

00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:06.474
This is a bad look for jaguars.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:08.684
I'll bite you.

00:37:08.768 --> 00:37:12.647
Please. My elderly mother
is waiting for me at home.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:13.564
Then

00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:16.359
why are you out so late?

00:37:16.984 --> 00:37:18.110
You're excused. Go.

00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:24.283
Still want to die an honorable death?

00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:31.874
I did some digging as you ordered me to.

00:37:31.958 --> 00:37:35.419
The auto shop is her side hustle,
and she actually has another day job.

00:37:39.715 --> 00:37:41.008
Elon Musk.

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:42.635
Should I just kill him?

00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:56.315
She must have made a fortune.
She didn't even pick up the pen.

00:37:56.899 --> 00:37:59.527
And now comes the really important intel.

00:38:00.194 --> 00:38:01.028
Go on.

00:38:01.654 --> 00:38:04.407
How come you close shop
every 4th, 14th, and 24th?

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.826
Any particular reason, boss?

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:09.912
Four. Death's number.

00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:10.871
DEATH

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:14.875
- She wants Death's number?
- No, that's not it.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:19.505
Anyway, rain or shine,
she has a routine that she sticks to.

00:38:20.006 --> 00:38:22.508
Scuba diving on the 4th.
Hiking on the 14th.

00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:24.010
The workshop on the 24th.

00:38:24.093 --> 00:38:25.720
- And every Wednesday--
- Gamja-tang!

00:38:27.513 --> 00:38:28.347
Wow.

00:38:30.599 --> 00:38:32.351
So that's what that meant.

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:48.617
"As natural a death as possible."

00:38:50.077 --> 00:38:52.246
"…like deep-sea equipment failure…

00:38:55.624 --> 00:38:57.877
or a fall on a remote trail."

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.724
Ki Ka-young's entire routine

00:39:11.807 --> 00:39:14.477
is her way of preparing for her death.

00:39:15.227 --> 00:39:17.313
The fact that a human body is 70% water

00:39:17.396 --> 00:39:19.774
means that blood
is the heaviest part of it.

00:39:20.399 --> 00:39:23.736
So I thought about it, and if you start
by draining the blood, and then…

00:39:24.487 --> 00:39:27.406
Here, here, here,

00:39:28.324 --> 00:39:29.241
and here.

00:39:30.117 --> 00:39:32.370
If you chop them up like so
and stack the pieces,

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.038
you'd only need a coffin…

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.666
about this small, no?

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:41.003
Ms. Ki Ka-young.
I'm moving overseas next week.

00:39:42.004 --> 00:39:43.631
Is business here that slow?

00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:54.809
So she just bought the place.

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:01.982
Wow.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.318
Coffins and all?

00:40:05.694 --> 00:40:07.822
She plans to die
as soon as Oh Pan-geum does.

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:09.115
What if she dies too soon?

00:40:09.198 --> 00:40:11.325
You can't exactly
take revenge on the dead.

00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:13.536
We'll just have to stop her
from dying too soon.

00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:15.454
I have my ways.

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:17.915
Let's make sure

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.043
Oh Pan-geum sticks around.

00:40:24.797 --> 00:40:28.092
Oh dear, my back. My goodness.

00:40:29.176 --> 00:40:32.054
I'm so old. I should just die soon.

00:40:32.555 --> 00:40:33.556
- No!
- Good heavens!

00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:34.765
Where on your back?

00:40:35.683 --> 00:40:37.393
Where does it hurt? Lie down.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.229
Is it here? Or here? Or maybe here?

00:40:40.312 --> 00:40:41.522
- What are you doing?
- Here?

00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:43.649
How's that?
Think you'll live a little longer?

00:40:46.485 --> 00:40:48.362
Good heavens, my shoulder.

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:52.324
What would be the use in cooking
a delicious stew with this garlic?

00:40:52.408 --> 00:40:53.325
In my old age--

00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:54.493
No!

00:40:54.577 --> 00:40:55.744
What about the garlic?

00:40:56.495 --> 00:40:58.414
Should I grind it? Hand it here.

00:41:02.084 --> 00:41:05.921
If you followed her here
all the way from the Middle East,

00:41:06.005 --> 00:41:08.007
you must have
some pretty serious feelings.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.176
Well, I knew as soon as I saw her

00:41:10.259 --> 00:41:12.803
that she was the one
I'd been waiting for all this time.

00:41:12.887 --> 00:41:13.762
Goodness me.

00:41:14.555 --> 00:41:16.432
At first sight? Right away?

00:41:17.391 --> 00:41:19.643
Of course, Ki Ka-young
didn't believe me at first.

00:41:21.896 --> 00:41:24.356
So I took her up a skyscraper.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.360
One of those places where you can see
all the city lights and the night sky?

00:41:28.444 --> 00:41:31.614
So what did you do up there?

00:41:33.407 --> 00:41:35.367
That's a little intense for your ears.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:37.745
But one thing's for sure.

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:40.873
Ki Ka-young is unlike
any other woman I've ever met.

00:41:40.956 --> 00:41:43.167
She just drives me wild,
so I grabbed her neck--

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.669
Gracious me, stop that now!

00:41:48.255 --> 00:41:49.840
In any case, you mean to say

00:41:49.924 --> 00:41:53.636
you came all this way after falling
for each other at first sight?

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.054
Falling?

00:41:56.138 --> 00:41:57.515
It wasn't a fall. More of a thud.

00:41:58.224 --> 00:41:59.558
It was totally a thud.

00:42:00.643 --> 00:42:02.019
Still brings tears to my eyes.

00:42:04.813 --> 00:42:05.940
Say your four pillars.

00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:07.858
"Four pillars"? What's that?

00:42:07.942 --> 00:42:11.320
The day you were born.
It's best if you know the time too.

00:42:13.322 --> 00:42:17.368
The day I was born, you say?
I was born on a Thursday.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.996
Around 13.8 billion years

00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:22.706
BC.

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.381
No need to call me "sir" though.

00:42:34.552 --> 00:42:36.303
Let me see.

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:39.390
I really should get around
to tending to that field.

00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:01.579
Oh Pan-geum might live forever,
but you might not last long.

00:43:02.454 --> 00:43:04.290
Here. I brought you a snack.

00:43:04.873 --> 00:43:07.084
There's something
I couldn't tell you last time.

00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:10.921
My boss asked me
if she and I had also met before.

00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:16.260
What do you mean by that?

00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:19.013
Of course we have. We met just yesterday.

00:43:19.096 --> 00:43:21.432
Not that. I mean, 983 years ago.

00:43:23.976 --> 00:43:25.269
Do you recall that time now?

00:43:25.352 --> 00:43:28.355
No. Your master said that he and I
knew each other from the past,

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.608
so I wondered if you and I
had also met before.

00:43:30.691 --> 00:43:32.234
We did, actually.

00:43:32.318 --> 00:43:34.153
But so what if we did?

00:43:34.653 --> 00:43:36.447
I want to know what happened.

00:43:38.866 --> 00:43:39.742
Back then…

00:43:41.744 --> 00:43:43.078
how did I die?

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:46.373
So she doesn't remember.

00:43:47.082 --> 00:43:48.792
She only cares about how she died.

00:43:49.668 --> 00:43:51.295
I was locked up because of her.

00:43:53.005 --> 00:43:55.633
I spent 983 years thinking only about her.

00:43:58.052 --> 00:43:59.928
What were you thinking about?

00:44:02.014 --> 00:44:05.768
Whether that lump of clay, near death,
regretted using her wishes on others.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:10.606
Why am I asking myself that over and over
in this uncomfortable position?

00:44:10.689 --> 00:44:12.775
And why do I only have
one piece of furniture?

00:44:13.275 --> 00:44:17.154
Hundreds of years passed
as I pondered these three questions.

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:19.031
But the key thing is…

00:44:19.114 --> 00:44:22.368
Whatever you say next
better be meaningful.

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.246
I still don't know the answers.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.248
Damn it.

00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:30.626
Not exactly smart.

00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:32.002
Don't you dare tell her

00:44:32.086 --> 00:44:34.713
that she made three righteous wishes
before dying, okay?

00:44:34.797 --> 00:44:38.801
About her being righteous in every life
after that and… just everything.

00:44:38.884 --> 00:44:41.512
Never, okay?
You can't tell the lump of clay.

00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:43.514
I wouldn't dare tell her.

00:44:43.597 --> 00:44:46.225
But do you know
that Master's master is just outside?

00:44:49.728 --> 00:44:52.481
How much did you hear?

00:44:53.899 --> 00:44:55.359
Not exactly observant either.

00:44:58.028 --> 00:44:58.862
What the hell?

00:44:59.446 --> 00:45:01.031
Why shut the door?

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:06.328
Why are you dressed pretty today?
Hey, Ki Ka-young. Where are you going?

00:45:06.912 --> 00:45:08.163
Ki Ka-young!

00:45:08.247 --> 00:45:11.166
PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC

00:45:12.793 --> 00:45:14.420
Ms. Ki Ka-young, please come in.

00:45:34.356 --> 00:45:38.444
Why do I have to carry all this?
I don't feel good. And I'm dizzy.

00:45:38.527 --> 00:45:39.778
I'm wearing heels.

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:46.368
I'm going to need
a better reason than that.

00:45:48.787 --> 00:45:49.997
What are we doing here?

00:45:50.789 --> 00:45:54.877
Normal people come to places like this
to eat, take pictures, and such.

00:46:06.638 --> 00:46:07.598
Right this way.

00:46:39.713 --> 00:46:40.881
Your daily pills.

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:42.925
Do you get them from that place?

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:44.927
Do they make you better?

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:47.638
What do you think?
They're for Grandma's peace of mind.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.141
A few are vitamins.

00:46:55.103 --> 00:46:57.815
Why? Were you hoping
the pills would make me better?

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:00.442
Do you always feel like killing me?

00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:03.821
Because you're Satan?

00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:08.826
I never said that.

00:47:10.035 --> 00:47:10.869
So, what?

00:47:12.454 --> 00:47:15.165
You're not normal,
so where do you actually want to go?

00:47:42.234 --> 00:47:43.777
Swear you won't push me this time.

00:48:03.422 --> 00:48:06.258
You don't think we were caught
on any cameras, do you?

00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:08.802
Who knows?

00:48:14.016 --> 00:48:15.350
Maybe I will push you.

00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:19.897
I don't understand
why you're angry right now.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.523
Right now, you do know.

00:48:25.861 --> 00:48:28.572
It's nice that you can
find comfort somewhere.

00:48:28.655 --> 00:48:31.199
I guess this is one perk
of owning the lamp.

00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:37.122
It's dark up here, so maybe it'd be harder
to see that I'm devoid of emotions.

00:48:38.624 --> 00:48:40.292
In that sense, I like you.

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:46.840
Come on,

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:50.177
you can't just drop
something like that on me.

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:56.099
Why exactly

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:58.518
do you like me?

00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:00.020
You

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:02.773
are like the cars I fix,

00:49:02.856 --> 00:49:06.735
my adjustable wrench, the wheels I roll,
those sorts of things.

00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:09.237
I don't need to read your emotions.

00:49:10.155 --> 00:49:11.239
You're sturdy.

00:49:11.865 --> 00:49:13.116
And sometimes, you shine.

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:16.328
Of all the things I've owned since birth,

00:49:16.828 --> 00:49:20.457
Grandma, Min-ji, the auto shop, my car,

00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:22.668
gamja-tang, frogs…

00:49:23.502 --> 00:49:25.420
- Frogs?
- The sound of dental scaling…

00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:27.839
If I'm this far down the list,
you must not like me.

00:49:27.923 --> 00:49:29.675
You haven't even mentioned me yet.

00:49:32.094 --> 00:49:32.928
Fine.

00:49:33.845 --> 00:49:35.305
I shall try to improve my rank.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.435
Dear Master. Today, I shall gift you
with the greatest darkness.

00:50:09.297 --> 00:50:11.133
Now we can finally see the stars.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:37.993
What?

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:39.953
Do it.

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:43.457
Do what?

00:50:44.124 --> 00:50:46.710
When a man says something like
"Let's gaze at the stars,"

00:50:46.793 --> 00:50:48.587
then it's 100% the moment to kiss.

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:50.088
It's the moment

00:50:50.839 --> 00:50:51.673
for a kiss.

00:50:55.343 --> 00:50:56.928
I've always wondered how it feels.

00:50:58.263 --> 00:51:00.932
That's not what this is!
What do you take spirits for?

00:51:04.394 --> 00:51:05.437
I won't kiss you.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.230
That's not fair. Why not?

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:09.149
You mentioned the stars!

00:51:12.778 --> 00:51:15.447
Fine. Then just stand still.

00:51:16.198 --> 00:51:17.699
I'll do it.

00:51:23.371 --> 00:51:25.248
What's this? Are they usually like this?

00:51:25.999 --> 00:51:27.042
No, I--

00:51:27.125 --> 00:51:28.877
Don't move. Let me try again.

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.349
It still feels exactly the same.

00:51:45.227 --> 00:51:46.895
Why do people even like doing this?

00:51:59.074 --> 00:51:59.991
Wow.

00:52:03.161 --> 00:52:05.205
I really didn't want to do this…

00:52:09.835 --> 00:52:10.836
but you're wrong.

00:52:11.378 --> 00:52:12.712
It's different when I do it.

00:56:31.137 --> 00:56:36.142

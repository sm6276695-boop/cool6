GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.694
- Someone's hacking the security system.
- What do they want?

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.738
Who is it? Russia? Or North Korea?

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:14.407
They're finding out now.
We should rush over.

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.096
SHOCK

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.931
SEDUCTION

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:58.952
Sleep well?

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:01.996
Let's kiss.

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.874
I need to plant onions.

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.094
Goodness me.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.972
Done with the onions? Let's kiss.

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:22.642
Hold up. I left that thing back there.
Silly me.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:05.768
You came back for this coffin?

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:09.063
- You've found it now, so let's kiss--
- Wait up. Stop.

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:12.400
This isn't something you can
just do whenever, you know?

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:14.861
You like rules, don't you?

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:17.155
These things have rules too.

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:19.741
- What are those rules?
- Well, those rules are…

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:23.244
First, the weather.

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:25.205
Rain. It must be raining.

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:26.664
Not yesterday.

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.626
It was the first time yesterday.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:32.212
First kisses tend to be

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.923
more spontaneous,
less restricted by the rules.

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.508
But it must be raining for the second one.

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:39.802
And there must be alcohol.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.013
Just after a drink. Right then.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.600
It's that complex?

00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:47.894
It's even more complex. I simplified it.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:49.771
Now close this back up.

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:54.150
You're really mixing identities like this?

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:09.249
The first digit has changed again.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.668
That fucking psycho bitch.

LUNCH BREAK
12 P.M. TO 1 P.M.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:37.777
Ms. Gu, weren't you classmates
with Ki Ka-young and Choi Min-ji?

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.113
- Yes.
- Did you see their bags?

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:41.364
They're both Hermès.

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.742
She's just letting it sit on the floor.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.662
Hey, could we get two iced Americanos?

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.625
He always does that
when we're headed to lunch.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.752
You go ahead.
I'll take a soybean paste stew.

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:58.214
You really should open
a retirement savings fund account.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.800
The earlier you plan for retirement,
the better.

00:05:00.883 --> 00:05:03.136
I'm good. I don't need retirement.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.764
What do you mean
you don't need retirement?

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:10.601
It's just Ms. Ki prefers
aggressive investments over low-risk ones.

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.729
Of course, I understand.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:16.399
We should give you our new towel sets.
Ms. Gu? Where are they?

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:18.609
Did you forget?

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.405
Come on, Ms. Gu.
You should take more initiative.

00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:24.699
I'll bring them right over.

00:05:24.782 --> 00:05:27.118
Back to the topic of retirement, well…

00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:30.246
How should I explain this?
The profitability…

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:44.052
As of today, construction is complete.
I just need a move-in date.

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:46.304
Do you like it?

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:47.805
Yes, Dad.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.024
Daddy!

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:00.068
Goodness, you're blinding me!

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.153
My darling princess,
did you study hard today?

00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:05.156
Like my life depended on it.
I'm tired as hell.

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:08.201
I was paired up
with the transfer student today.

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:09.869
- And?
- He's really cute.

00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:13.122
He is? Did he become
the apple of your eye, Princess?

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.916
He seems really classy.

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.085
- So I asked where he lived.
- And?

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.754
- He lives in the mansion we talked about.
- Over there?

00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:21.464
- Yeah.
- They moved in?

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.925
If they've moved in,
they should at least say hi.

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.761
Guess we'll have to make a house call.

00:06:26.844 --> 00:06:28.012
Open up!

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.606
Wait, those rules

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:40.525
were this accurate?

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:47.031
Genie, tell me about tomorrow's weather.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.241
Why would you ask me?

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:50.535
Weather is a touchy subject
for me right now!

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:53.371
Why are you making such a fuss
when I asked Genie?

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.457
Genie, so what's the weather
like tomorrow?

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.585
It's set to be a clear and sunny day
in Cheongpung tomorrow.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:00.503
Hear that?

00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:04.257
You should try asking it something.
It's so accurate.

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:11.556
Hey. Other Genie.

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:15.101
What does Ki Ka-young ask about the most?

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:18.688
Here is a list of Ms. Ki Ka-young's
recent search history.

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:22.900
Rainmaking ritual, artificial rain,
alcohol content of different beers,

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:25.361
cool-toned lip tint,
lightning-fast delivery,

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:28.781
rainmaking ritual…

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.325
What the hell have you done, you idiot?

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.540
Find out when it will rain this week.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:40.835
I just checked since the cherry blossom
festival starts tomorrow.

00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:42.795
Luckily, this entire week will be clear.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.088
Damn it, why?

00:07:45.923 --> 00:07:47.133
What about next week?

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:51.721
The spring rain hits next week,
so Monday may be the only dry day.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:54.056
- Monday will be dry?
- Would you like it not to be?

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.600
You can do that?

00:07:57.518 --> 00:08:00.062
- Since you're a mythical beast?
- I couldn't do it myself.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.481
But I can try praying.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.819
Not exactly useful.

00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:10.114
What is this about?
Please put the wrench down.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:13.659
Is something there?

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:15.244
I'm pretty today.

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:21.292
Pretty.

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:25.838
Pretty.

00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:32.011
It's like the town is broke or something.

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:34.055
Why couldn't they get IU
for the festival--

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:35.097
What are you doing?

00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:37.058
Put that down!

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:41.729
I'm pretty.

00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:44.941
Even prettier than before.

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.609
Goodness, young lady.

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:49.779
There are mirrors all over this house!

00:08:56.994 --> 00:08:59.497
It's not your fault, Master.

00:09:01.165 --> 00:09:04.544
Psychopaths tend to be
pretty narcissistic.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.587
Is that true?

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:08.214
Thank goodness.

00:09:08.297 --> 00:09:10.883
I thought I must have
made her pretty somehow.

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.052
I was pretty awesome in the moment.

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:15.805
Why did I pick that moment
to get all competitive?

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.765
What are you talking about?

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:20.351
Now is the prime moment
to get competitive.

00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:22.395
That kiss was the gateway to corruption.

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:24.605
Right. It should be, but…

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.275
After 1,000 years,

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:29.944
it was practically my first kiss.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:32.738
I almost died from nerves.

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:36.033
I just feel bad for Ejllael.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:39.495
I hear he hits the gym nonstop
because he wants to slit your throat.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.748
Had he known a kiss would floor you,
he could've avoided all that effort.

00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:46.335
By the way,
if it was your first in 1,000 years…

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:48.212
Yeah, what?

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:50.590
Shouldn't you have gotten
a dental scaling first?

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:51.507
Total jerk move.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:55.886
Dental scaling?

00:09:57.513 --> 00:09:58.598
What is that?

00:10:07.648 --> 00:10:09.525
Raise your hand if you feel discomfort…

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.569
We haven't started yet.

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:13.070
Say, "Ah."

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.533
Bear with me for a moment.

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.086
You don't have any money?

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:30.588
And no ID?

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.049
You treated him with no intake info?

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:35.885
He said that he's a friend
of the auto shop owner, so…

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:37.845
Ka-young? But I'm her only friend…

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:40.306
Wait, are you the guy from the…

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.600
- Middle East?
- Min-ji? I'm so happy to see you!

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:48.397
I saw you eating gamja-tang together
at the gamja-tang place!

00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:53.653
Does seeing us eat gamja-tang together
excuse you from paying?

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:56.822
A tab?

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.075
Ridiculous, isn't it?

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.077
It's outrageous, isn't it?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.204
Apparently, he doesn't have ID.

00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:04.914
And his name is none other than…

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.334
Lee Beul-li.

00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:10.044
Lee Beul-li.

00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:13.714
That immediately killed my curiosity,
so I stopped asking questions.

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:16.342
Do you even know anything
about this person?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.888
One thing I know for certain
is that he isn't human.

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:23.391
No, of course he isn't.

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:26.519
No decent human racks up a tab
with someone they just met.

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:28.771
I'm feeling immense discomfort,

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.065
so here are my hands.

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:32.608
Seriously? I could just…

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:36.028
Dr. Choi, we need to get
to the festival to volunteer.

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:37.238
Okay. I'm coming.

00:11:38.572 --> 00:11:40.908
At this rate,
you'll wind up in big trouble.

00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:44.912
Snap out of it, Ms. Ki.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:49.083
Okay, so he has a decent face,
and he's pretty tall.

00:11:49.166 --> 00:11:51.043
And yeah, he has a velvety voice.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:53.462
Other than that,
what's he got going for him?

00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:02.513
It was essential given the rainy season.

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.058
I'll pay you back
once I become a pro gamer…

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:07.727
A pro gamer?

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.397
You've lost every game
to the neighborhood kid.

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:12.940
Pro gamer, you say?

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.401
Come here.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.785
I dodged her pretty well today.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.788
I was only hit on one side.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:47.349
What the heck?

00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:49.393
Ms. Ki.

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:52.062
Check the tire pressure for me, would you?

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:53.022
Sure.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:02.406
You're drinking.

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.325
Yes, that I am.

00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:07.620
And you're at the wheel
with the engine on.

00:13:07.703 --> 00:13:09.205
Yes, I'm at the wheel.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.915
Engine?

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:12.583
What's that?

00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:13.793
All right, sir.

00:13:14.376 --> 00:13:15.503
Blow into this for us.

00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:18.380
And what's this? Is it a pipe?

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:19.340
Go on.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.677
- Okay, more.
- More.

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:28.057
- Harder.
- Harder!

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:33.145
Hello, Homies!
It's Da-jin of Sky Farm Life.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:36.982
I'm coming to you today from
the Cheongpungho Cherry Blossom Festival.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:40.528
Let's start off by raiding
the For Daughter Strawberry stand.

00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:44.323
Guys, what do you call a strawberry
that was fired from its job?

00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:45.533
What?

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:46.450
Berry upset!

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:51.205
Right. "Berry upset!"

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.582
You're hilarious!

00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:57.211
See that? Nothing flops for no reason.

00:13:57.294 --> 00:13:58.254
That was great.

00:13:58.337 --> 00:13:59.964
- Cherry blossoms!
- Indeed.

00:14:00.047 --> 00:14:01.799
Open wide. That's it.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.677
Can we try opening up a little wider?

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.970
Even wider!

00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:08.097
Hello. We're from Cheongpungho Bank.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.558
We have a savings event,
so visit for a consultation.

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:13.102
Hello.

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:18.983
Where is the bathroom?

00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:20.860
Is the subway station close by?

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:23.279
Without cilantro, please.

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:24.572
What are you saying?

00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:25.865
Are you an Arab?

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.534
You spoke Korean just fine earlier.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.245
He doesn't want any cilantro.

00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:32.204
What?

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:36.125
Arabic was big back in school,
so I took it as my second language.

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:37.710
I'll try speaking to him.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.754
My name is Oh Gyeong-yeol,

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:42.798
a police officer
from the Republic of Korea.

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.801
Sir, you have violated the traffic laws--

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:49.263
Get over here.

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:51.181
You said speaking Arabic would work.

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:54.643
About that. It worked for me
toward the end of the Joseon dynasty…

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.646
Just go. I'll handle things here.

00:14:58.147 --> 00:14:58.981
I could just…

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.155
Oh Pan-geum!

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:08.365
Buy that to eat. That one.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:12.411
Why are you walking around
eating raw tofu?

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:14.955
I hear this is post-police food.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.875
Oh Pan-geum, you should drink
some black goat extract.

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.084
To live a long life.

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:22.630
I don't have that kind of money!
Why don't you buy me one, then?

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:26.467
I can't buy things for you.
I only make recommendations.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:31.347
Honestly, I can't tell
if you're a bastard or just pitiful.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:32.723
Goodness me.

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:34.600
- What?
- Hey, would you look at that?

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:38.103
Goodness, that puppy
is bouncing around on its own.

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:39.605
How incredible, no?

00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:42.191
- Wow. What is this?
- Come and have a look.

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:43.692
- How adorable!
- It's walking!

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:44.652
It's so cool.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.906
Hey, it's walking
but still stays in the same spot.

00:15:48.989 --> 00:15:49.949
How is that?

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:56.080
At least her joints seem strong.

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:00.751
My apologies.

00:16:04.004 --> 00:16:04.880
What is it?

00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:11.553
There's this thing called fireworks today.
Do you know when and where?

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:17.184
The fireworks?
They'll be set off after the sun sets.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.688
You'd get the best view from there.

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:21.605
Enjoy.

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:25.025
The best view is that way?

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:37.997
Ta-da.

00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:43.544
Damn, that fucker
looked like he was loaded.

00:16:44.044 --> 00:16:45.421
But he was broke, damn it.

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:49.049
Well, well. Look at these motherfuckers
with no common decency.

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:51.385
What do you think
you're doing on our turf?

00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:53.929
We thought we'd visit
the cherry blossom festival.

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.472
The spring breeze is a-blowing.

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:57.766
The cherry blossom festival is our turf.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.645
We didn't go against the current to invade
your cherry salmon festival, did we?

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.814
You could always come to next year's.

00:17:03.897 --> 00:17:05.774
What, should we send you an invite?

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:09.486
Great, you should all get prosthetics
while you're here.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:13.907
You know the health services
in Cheongpung are first-class.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.995
- What the…
- What the heck?

00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:25.461
What a relief! I almost got beat up
by the lump of clay again.

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:27.337
And who's this prick?

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:28.839
Hey, which gang are you from?

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:31.550
- What?
- Why isn't he answering me?

00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:33.052
Just fucking wipe them all out!

00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:40.809
Darn it. I'm in the mood for flowers.

00:17:44.813 --> 00:17:47.316
- Damn you!
- Hey, you bastard!

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:07.294
Wow.

00:18:07.377 --> 00:18:08.587
Goodness me.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:09.963
Oh boy.

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:12.966
How stunning.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.554
AS SEXY
FUCK YOU

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:19.056
What the…

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.851
Goodness me, is that…

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:25.521
Is that my Ka-young's name up there?

00:18:26.021 --> 00:18:29.108
"As, sexy, fuck, you"?

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:31.068
Wait, what does that mean?

00:18:31.151 --> 00:18:33.028
So that prick does have money.

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.030
KI KA-YOUNG
YOU'RE IN MY HEART

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:37.407
So women really love those words?

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:40.369
Yes, I told you.
Just trust me with these things.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.538
They go absolutely wild.

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.498
She'll be corrupted in no time.

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:46.708
Perfect.

00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:59.346
KI KA-YOUNG
FUCK YOU

00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:02.057
That son of a gun.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:05.394
That's what I always think
when I see Iblis too.

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:08.313
I'm glad you relate, Ms. Ki Ka-young.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:14.069
What brings you here? You don't even
have a car since you can fly.

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:17.656
Everyone in the village
is at the festival.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.700
I came as things are quiet.

00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:21.952
Do you have something to say to me?

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.163
I won't return your feather.

00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:26.748
It's yours.

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:31.211
What species are you, anyway?

00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:34.047
Just as there are Yorkshire terriers
and Chihuahuas,

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:37.968
there are humans, angels, devils,
and genies. So which are you?

00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:41.180
I'm obviously his servant.
You saw my wings. I'm an angel.

00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:43.348
Right, an angel?

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:47.060
I thought I'd double-check
since your wings were black.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.855
You do volunteer lunch runs, right?

00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:52.816
For a while, I've been thinking it's odd

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.236
how every time you deliver lunch,
the elderly person

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:58.322
ends up dead.

00:19:58.405 --> 00:20:02.743
I guess one could see it that way,
but try switching the order of events.

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:07.039
I visit dying elders to bring them peace.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.795
I see.

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:16.048
One more thing.

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:21.136
Several of your buildings are within
a one-kilometer radius of my auto shop,

00:20:21.845 --> 00:20:24.223
and you never hid your identity from me.

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:27.100
Are you spying on me?

00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:30.646
I am. To be more precise,
I'm working on his orders.

00:20:31.855 --> 00:20:33.523
What are they? His orders?

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:38.278
"If there comes a moment that Iblis
bows his head before a human, you shall

00:20:39.112 --> 00:20:40.781
slit your brother's throat."

00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:44.868
Isn't that thrilling?

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:50.415
That's why I'm going to do my best
to make sure Iblis doesn't win you over.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:20:59.925
It's too late.

00:21:01.718 --> 00:21:02.761
Pardon?

00:21:03.303 --> 00:21:05.013
Get lost so I can close shop.

00:21:06.181 --> 00:21:07.182
Right.

00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:08.976
Is that the time?

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:14.064
But why are you being so rude?

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:17.359
Who knows? Maybe because psychopaths
can't hide their displeasure?

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:20.487
Or because you're trying to kill him
when I'm his master?

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.405
Or maybe because

00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:24.574
he's already won me over.

00:21:26.243 --> 00:21:28.078
Which of these do you think it is?

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:37.963
I knew I was right about her.

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:45.012
A STUDY OF PSYCHOPATHS

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:46.847
Did something happen?

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:49.683
- I brought the books--
- Throw them out again.

00:21:50.183 --> 00:21:52.686
Psychopath? I'm absolutely certain!

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:56.273
I should've known it was too lucky.

00:21:57.816 --> 00:22:00.694
At this rate, there's no telling
about her last two wishes.

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:03.447
Should I have taken my scythe with me?

00:22:03.947 --> 00:22:06.491
She had the audacity
to tell me to "get lost."

00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:07.826
Like she was dismissing me!

00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:10.078
- To you, Master?
- Yes.

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:12.331
You do look a little young for your age.

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:18.795
Did you see the fireworks?
Weren't they cool?

00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:20.088
I did that, you know.

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:22.299
Why did you choose that…

00:22:23.091 --> 00:22:24.926
Please, no!

00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:27.471
Hey, no using cheats like that!

00:22:27.554 --> 00:22:29.514
So you were behind the fireworks?

00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:31.141
Yes.

00:22:31.641 --> 00:22:34.186
I wondered
which crazy fool was behind them.

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:35.687
Crazy what?

00:22:38.648 --> 00:22:41.401
Hey, where do you live?
Lead the way, punk.

00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:42.819
And where do you live?

00:22:43.904 --> 00:22:44.821
Lead the way.

00:22:47.574 --> 00:22:48.408
Pardon?

00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:52.120
The typical psychopath

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.540
will harm others

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:57.709
to get what they want.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.588
But my dear Ka-young
is a little different.

00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:05.926
Her grandma and the entire neighborhood
rallied to raise her with hope,

00:23:06.009 --> 00:23:08.178
so even though she may not feel guilt,

00:23:08.678 --> 00:23:11.473
she knows to stay
within her learned boundaries.

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:15.727
All right. So what?

00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:18.480
So I'm saying I don't like you, you jerk.

00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:22.317
Ka-young will stay within those boundaries
no matter what,

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:25.737
and I will protect Ka-young
as she does so.

00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:28.448
Whether it be psychologically…

00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:33.703
or physically.

00:23:35.872 --> 00:23:38.083
I'm her knight in shining armor, you see.

00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:39.793
You are, aren't you?

00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:44.005
All this time,
I thought you were a girl! Wow!

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.091
This is on the house.

00:24:09.906 --> 00:24:11.158
Why are you laughing?

00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:13.201
Funniest thing I've heard in 983 years.

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:15.704
Nine hundred and eighty…

00:24:16.496 --> 00:24:18.331
What the hell are you talking about?

00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:23.628
Now that we have a man in the mix,
you come to a seafood stew joint?

00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:25.088
I can't believe you.

00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:26.882
I didn't come. I just stopped by.

00:24:27.382 --> 00:24:29.801
I'll drop Min-ji off,
so I'll see you at home.

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:31.428
Can't I take her home?

00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:33.889
We've actually bonded. Honestly. Master?

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.391
Just call me "ma'am."

00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:38.685
Do you need anything else?

00:24:41.771 --> 00:24:42.689
Benevolence?

00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:47.986
Min-ji didn't pay before she left,
but I'm…

00:24:49.488 --> 00:24:50.739
I'm completely broke.

00:24:59.122 --> 00:25:01.249
I know about that. Allow me.

00:25:06.713 --> 00:25:07.839
I've reached 112, right?

00:25:08.798 --> 00:25:10.133
I'm turning myself in.

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:20.685
Eating without paying? Seriously?

00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:24.689
This is unfair. I didn't even eat.
I just did the "not paying" part.

00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:25.732
Shut it.

00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:27.901
Why did you call me to bail you out?

00:25:27.984 --> 00:25:30.153
What about the one who's like you?
That angel!

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.823
You're mistaken about that.

00:25:36.493 --> 00:25:39.746
Not only are Ejllael and I
different species, we're on bad terms.

00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:42.040
You and I are also on bad terms.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.920
What's with you lowering your voice?

00:25:47.003 --> 00:25:49.422
I may be Satan,
but this is no laughing matter.

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:54.052
Ejllael and I fought a long battle.

00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:57.430
The war was devastating for me too.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.516
Why did you go to war?

00:26:07.857 --> 00:26:09.818
He created angels from light

00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:13.530
and genies from smokeless fire.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.579
The genies created from fire
grew increasingly arrogant,

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:23.665
even aspiring to surpass Him.

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:31.006
In his rage, he sent the angels
and ordered them to decimate us.

00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:57.532
The angels came down
and began slaughtering all the genies,

00:26:58.533 --> 00:27:01.786
and Ejllael led the charge.

00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:10.128
The war lasted 300 years,

00:27:10.712 --> 00:27:12.714
and I lost most of my brothers
as a result.

00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:18.053
So your quarrels turn into
full-blown wars of the gods?

00:27:18.553 --> 00:27:20.555
I've rarely seen my brothers since then.

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:25.560
Partly because I defied his orders
and ended up in hell.

00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:30.523
And once released, I ended up trapped
for almost 1,000 years, so there's that.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.612
Where are your surviving brothers now?

00:27:38.073 --> 00:27:39.032
I'm not sure.

00:27:39.115 --> 00:27:42.160
They're probably inhabiting rings or lamps

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:45.163
or living out their days in a pot.

00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:48.875
They may be controlling sleep…

00:27:56.424 --> 00:27:58.510
or tending to the flowers of souls.

00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:09.270
Or perhaps controlling the rain.

00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:13.274
One controls the rain?

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:19.739
- What?
- Can't you find him? Find him and--

00:28:19.823 --> 00:28:21.408
Can't. No longer with us.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.120
I think Sade is looking for me.

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:32.544
I'm pretty sure
Sade isn't looking for you.

00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:04.117
Wow.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.048
Miss, does the owner of this car
live in this neighborhood?

00:29:19.132 --> 00:29:19.966
Yes.

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:21.593
Must be a crypto bro.

00:29:22.343 --> 00:29:23.678
I used to drive one of these.

00:29:24.345 --> 00:29:25.555
That's the 2024 model.

00:29:27.807 --> 00:29:28.975
Hey, come on!

00:29:29.058 --> 00:29:31.686
I said to patch the puncture,
not take the tire off!

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:33.646
It needs to be changed.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:38.401
Did you even report all these?
Every one of these modifications?

00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:41.321
What are you, a civil servant?
Why would I report anything?

00:29:41.404 --> 00:29:42.614
Hey, put it back on.

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:47.202
Where do you live?

00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:49.454
Why do you ask?

00:29:50.705 --> 00:29:51.748
Like what you see?

00:29:52.248 --> 00:29:54.542
Just concerned
you'll croak on your way home.

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:56.628
Did you do these wheels yourself?

00:29:57.212 --> 00:29:59.339
You shoved them on
when they don't even fit.

00:29:59.422 --> 00:30:01.549
A simple patch-up wouldn't last an hour.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.136
I've explained everything,
so call a tow truck and take it away.

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:06.638
I won't fix it.

00:30:07.722 --> 00:30:10.683
Is this how you treat your customers?
Hey, get over here.

00:30:21.069 --> 00:30:22.487
Is everything good?

00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:25.406
You drank that?

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.826
There were so many bottles.
Weren't they for staff?

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.745
No wonder they kept going missing.

00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:34.082
Wait, what were you saying?

00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:37.585
I was just asking
for the tow truck number.

00:30:38.545 --> 00:30:40.755
Zero, one, zero,

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:43.258
six, three, four…

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:44.968
- Wait, I didn't catch that.
- Two…

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.638
Did you hit him?

00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:56.104
Six, three, four…

00:30:58.439 --> 00:31:01.109
What are you going to do
about this random, dreamy vibe?

00:31:02.193 --> 00:31:03.903
I'm sorry. I'll report everything.

00:31:03.987 --> 00:31:05.363
- I swear.
- Where are you going?

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.824
- Damn it.
- Don't go.

00:31:07.907 --> 00:31:09.158
Hello, ma'am.

00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:15.373
- Hello.
- Thank you. Feel free to browse.

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:17.834
Who's in charge of this display?

00:31:18.334 --> 00:31:20.003
Who's responsible for this station?

00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:22.297
Hey, you're back!

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:24.424
I'm sorry, Im-seon.

00:31:24.507 --> 00:31:27.385
I had to step out for a moment.
My bowels were acting up again.

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:31.848
Don't you think it's wrong
to call your branch manager by name?

00:31:33.182 --> 00:31:35.310
At our age, we're all a little unwell.

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:37.520
Is it too much to ask you to do your job?

00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:42.901
I can't take any more of this crap.

00:31:43.443 --> 00:31:45.570
Ms. Jung Yeong-sun. What did you just say?

00:31:46.779 --> 00:31:50.533
I said I can't stand it anymore.
This is so ridiculous that I quit.

00:31:50.617 --> 00:31:52.201
Im-seon, this is just wrong.

00:31:52.285 --> 00:31:54.370
Has the late promotion gone to your head?

00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:55.622
Ms. Jung Yeong-sun!

00:31:55.705 --> 00:31:57.707
I don't know how you were even promoted,

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.001
but is this how you treat your coworkers?

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:02.962
We've all heard the rumors
about you taking bribes from vendors.

00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:04.589
Do we look like fools?

00:32:04.672 --> 00:32:06.215
Yeong-sun, please!

00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:09.594
How could I be so stupid?

00:32:10.178 --> 00:32:13.056
I shouldn't have asked to be
a branch manager at this age.

00:32:13.139 --> 00:32:15.767
People look down on me,
and I keep making mistakes.

00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:22.774
I guess I could get to it a bit quicker.

00:32:24.484 --> 00:32:25.485
Excuse me?

00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:27.904
Here's my second wish.

00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:30.239
Take me back 20 years

00:32:30.823 --> 00:32:32.450
and make me branch manager then.

00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:37.956
If I'd made branch manager back then,
just imagine all the money.

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:49.217
Shall we go, then?
Twenty years into the past?

00:33:09.028 --> 00:33:11.489
BRANCH MANAGER
KANG IM-SEON

00:33:14.409 --> 00:33:17.161
Go through that door,
and it will be 20 years in the past,

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:20.123
and you will still be the branch manager.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.425
Talk to me.

00:33:56.909 --> 00:34:00.204
Why are you alone?
Where's Dad? He said he'd pick you up.

00:34:00.997 --> 00:34:02.498
Dad has work to do.

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:07.462
Long time no see.

00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:10.256
Do you still like hot chamomile tea?

00:34:10.339 --> 00:34:13.509
Yes. I'm still a psychopath,
so caffeine isn't good for me.

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:18.931
You haven't changed a bit.

00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:21.601
I thought you'd at least ask,
"What brings you here?"

00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:24.145
I moved here with my wife and son.

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:27.523
Take good care of us. I found out
about this place thanks to you.

00:34:29.275 --> 00:34:33.196
I don't recall ever telling you
exactly where I live.

00:34:33.279 --> 00:34:36.657
Not many University of Science grads
run auto shops.

00:34:37.366 --> 00:34:38.701
I guess.

00:34:38.785 --> 00:34:42.038
Either way, it's good to see you again.
You look great.

00:34:42.663 --> 00:34:43.831
How's business?

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:49.462
True joy.

00:35:05.144 --> 00:35:07.897
I guess the house looked
pretty much the same 20 years ago.

00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:12.318
Except for you.

00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:40.054
You grow up to be super pretty
20 years from now.

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:42.890
So careful with this.
You wouldn't want to hurt…

00:35:47.728 --> 00:35:48.771
What is it?

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.315
Someone just entered my memory.

00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:59.073
Grandma told me not to speak to strangers.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:02.118
Leave!

00:36:02.201 --> 00:36:03.661
Wait, no!

00:36:03.744 --> 00:36:04.954
Hey, you startled me.

00:36:06.247 --> 00:36:08.457
So you're clearly as odd as ever.

00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:14.172
"So you're clearly as odd as ever."

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:18.217
He was sleazy as hell.

00:36:18.718 --> 00:36:20.845
So how did you hurt your head again?

00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:24.223
Who else would it be?

00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:27.310
She was even worse 20 years ago.

00:36:27.393 --> 00:36:29.437
Did you visit the past for a wish?

00:36:30.104 --> 00:36:31.189
Yeah.

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:52.168
That'll be 18,000 won.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.216
I need to see your ID for the alcohol…

00:37:17.693 --> 00:37:18.611
Ms. Ki!

00:37:18.694 --> 00:37:20.780
What's wrong? Is something up?

00:37:21.614 --> 00:37:23.366
Just that it's raining.

00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:26.244
Keep up the good work.

00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:36.671
Where the hell is he?

00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:43.386
Wait, what?

00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:44.595
Why is it stopping?

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.723
But it's the rainy season!

00:38:00.486 --> 00:38:02.446
Where the hell were you? It rained!

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:05.449
Do you know how long
I looked everywhere for you?

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:06.784
Seriously?

00:38:06.867 --> 00:38:08.244
Hey, you're the one

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.997
who took a rock this big, you know.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.000
You do all that,
then I hear about you acting all "odd."

00:38:14.083 --> 00:38:16.210
You're deflecting because you're cornered.

00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:19.005
I'm in a corner? Who was the jerk
who came by the auto shop?

00:38:19.588 --> 00:38:21.549
I heard you were giggling with each other.

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:24.302
Kiss me or crack my skull,
but just do one.

00:38:24.385 --> 00:38:26.595
You can't do both, you serial kisser!

00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:27.513
I can't?

00:38:28.597 --> 00:38:31.058
Then I choose to crack your skull.
Come here.

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:33.394
Hey, come on. You're my master.

00:38:35.855 --> 00:38:37.481
Shush. We're talking right now.

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:39.900
Come on. Treat me with care.

00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:41.277
Take care of me.

00:38:41.944 --> 00:38:42.903
I said shush!

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:46.574
Why does every damn dog around here
bark like mad whenever they see you?

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:48.826
They're just scared I'll take them in.

00:38:49.535 --> 00:38:52.580
They need to read human expressions,
but I don't have any.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.583
Hey, I don't plan on taking you in either!

00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:09.972
Sade!

00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:20.733
I am Genie, the lamp spirit.
…shall grant you three wishes…

00:39:20.816 --> 00:39:22.234
…no traveling to the future.

00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:23.486
Anything besides that,

00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:25.196
your wish… is my command.

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:28.407
But before that,

00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:32.078
tell all the dogs in the area
to stop barking at Ki Ka-young.

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:34.538
If they bark one more time,

00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:37.166
I'll change every last one of you
into cats.

00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:39.085
Tell him.

00:39:43.172 --> 00:39:44.048
Ki Ka-young.

00:39:48.636 --> 00:39:52.264
MUTT, AGE 7
MADE FIRST WISH ON MAY 16, 2024

00:39:52.348 --> 00:39:54.433
TO BECOME A PERSON, WITH SPECIFICS

00:39:54.517 --> 00:39:57.395
CHARMING MIDDLE-AGED MAN IN HIS 40S
WHO RESEMBLES DANIEL HENNEY

00:39:57.978 --> 00:40:00.022
Now that's not a face
you see in these parts.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:02.191
Is there a film shoot?

00:40:02.274 --> 00:40:04.527
Remember I was depressed
about losing my eyesight with age?

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:07.363
- Yeah?
- I think I just fully recovered.

00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:09.448
- Let's go, Yeong-sun.
- Sure.

00:40:10.032 --> 00:40:10.866
Wow.

00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:31.637
I'm hungry.

00:40:32.138 --> 00:40:33.013
Chicken and beer?

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:35.141
Sounds good. Let's do it.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.063
Suit and slicked back hair.
Wow, he's doggone handsome.

00:40:41.147 --> 00:40:42.523
He's coming this way.

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:44.525
Hand me some blotting paper and lip tint.

00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:04.086
- What's he doing?
- He must be crazy!

00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:05.838
My gosh!

00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:08.674
They say handsome men
are either gay or dogs.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.218
His actions clearly show

00:41:12.344 --> 00:41:13.345
he's a total mutt.

00:41:24.523 --> 00:41:25.941
You've run out of water.

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:34.700
Don't skip breakfast tomorrow.

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:41.165
Pardon?

00:41:44.376 --> 00:41:46.504
The food doesn't taste good.

00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:48.255
It's too bland.

00:41:50.299 --> 00:41:51.884
It's too bland for you?

00:41:52.885 --> 00:41:55.221
I should have been
more generous with the salt.

00:41:57.932 --> 00:41:59.016
I was only joking.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:05.105
What will happen to me now?

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.192
A question I'm tired of getting.

00:42:11.278 --> 00:42:12.905
One thing's for certain.

00:42:13.614 --> 00:42:15.699
I'll be saving on the cost of salt.

00:42:42.268 --> 00:42:43.352
Yes, Grandma?

00:42:43.435 --> 00:42:45.980
Ka-young, you're not seeing
things again, are you?

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:49.108
You're taking your meds, right?
Every dose without missing any?

00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:51.735
Yes, you see me take them every day. Why?

00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:55.906
If you have any wishes, just tell me.
I'll make them all come true.

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:57.825
Wishes?

00:42:57.908 --> 00:42:59.827
What is this in the notebook in your room?

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.788
Did you like Daniel Henney?

00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:06.542
You can see that?

00:43:08.294 --> 00:43:09.295
She can see that?

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:14.049
Wait, was it always visible
to everyone else's eyes?

00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:15.676
You're seriously asking me that?

00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:18.596
This damn magic has way too many holes.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.140
This won't do.

00:43:21.223 --> 00:43:24.018
We need a safe space
to hide the notebook and pen.

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:24.935
Your lamp.

00:43:25.686 --> 00:43:28.105
Are you sure
only you and Sade can get in?

00:43:29.315 --> 00:43:32.151
If they really wanted to,
Ejllael or Irem probably could.

00:43:32.234 --> 00:43:33.485
But even you couldn't.

00:43:33.569 --> 00:43:34.987
So it must be safe.

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:39.408
What does it look like inside the lamp?
Is it cozy?

00:43:41.994 --> 00:43:42.995
It's dismal.

00:44:04.433 --> 00:44:05.559
Do you see this?

00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:09.772
Do you get a sense of how lonely
I must have been for 983 years?

00:44:09.855 --> 00:44:11.815
Sorry, but I don't know
what loneliness is.

00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:14.652
But you do know to be sorry?

00:44:15.694 --> 00:44:16.779
Of course I don't.

00:44:17.363 --> 00:44:20.407
But Min-ji told me that leading with that
makes me seem considerate.

00:44:22.743 --> 00:44:24.328
And you know what considerate is?

00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:25.788
Yes. That one's quite easy.

00:44:26.288 --> 00:44:29.667
I just need to be honest.
For instance, it's something like this.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:32.169
I heard it all from that brother of yours.

00:44:32.252 --> 00:44:35.756
That you'll get your throat slit
if you bow your head to a righteous human.

00:44:36.256 --> 00:44:37.633
Ejllael, that prick!

00:44:38.967 --> 00:44:40.636
That was considerate? Not a threat?

00:44:41.261 --> 00:44:42.513
Are you seriously not

00:44:43.806 --> 00:44:44.682
scared of me?

00:44:44.765 --> 00:44:46.767
To be honest, I don't know what fear is.

00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:49.436
But Grandma did say
that apathy is the scariest.

00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:53.899
My grandma is an incredibly fragile
safety feature to my apathy.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.776
If that safety feature…

00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:58.779
were to disappear,

00:44:59.279 --> 00:45:01.573
there's a chance
my violence would take over,

00:45:01.657 --> 00:45:03.075
so I'm making preparations.

00:45:03.158 --> 00:45:04.910
But you'd know all that from spying on me.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.080
"As natural a death as possible."

00:45:08.914 --> 00:45:10.165
I do know, yes.

00:45:10.249 --> 00:45:14.420
Like deep-sea equipment failure
or a fall on a remote trail.

00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:19.800
But why do all that when you don't have
emotions or any affection for humans?

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:22.886
I am a stone in a shoe
to the people of the world.

00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:25.723
I make people uncomfortable.

00:45:25.806 --> 00:45:28.100
So I'm removing that stone for them.

00:45:29.685 --> 00:45:30.728
For my grandma.

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.650
So if you're going to kill me, hurry.
And don't go getting your throat slit.

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:43.073
Ejllael?

00:45:43.866 --> 00:45:46.744
The more I see that angel,
the less I like him.

00:45:47.369 --> 00:45:50.956
- Whatever you do, don't lose to him.
- Wait, you're actually taking my side?

00:45:51.749 --> 00:45:54.710
- Shouldn't I?
- You shouldn't. If you do, then…

00:45:55.377 --> 00:45:56.211
You know?

00:45:56.712 --> 00:45:57.588
I'm going to wring

00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:00.340
your neck.

00:46:00.883 --> 00:46:02.468
That would make things strange.

00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:04.011
We're already strange.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.014
You and I are both antisocial,

00:46:07.514 --> 00:46:10.058
so why am I under scrutiny
while you're admired?

00:46:13.687 --> 00:46:16.940
What exactly was his purpose
in making you and me meet?

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:21.153
That's it.

00:46:24.156 --> 00:46:26.533
I should have been pondering that.

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:28.368
Not totally clueless.

00:46:31.663 --> 00:46:33.040
Okay, we need furniture.

00:46:33.874 --> 00:46:36.960
Bring over the table and chairs
I made in the workshop.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.766
No matter which way I look at it,

00:46:50.849 --> 00:46:52.726
I don't think you made these.

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.771
They seem to be made
by a giant corporation.

00:46:55.854 --> 00:46:59.399
Don't talk back!
You now have two pieces of furniture.

00:47:01.735 --> 00:47:04.071
It'd be nice to have another rug,
wouldn't it?

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:19.711
This way. Here.

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:26.009
Starting the cleaning cycle.

00:47:32.558 --> 00:47:33.642
Why the hell is this…

00:47:33.725 --> 00:47:37.604
Is this used to fix things
or to destroy them?

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:39.731
That all depends on you.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.527
Hey!

00:47:45.487 --> 00:47:48.782
Go that way, and you won't come back.
It'd take over 1,000 years.

00:47:49.283 --> 00:47:50.242
That thing.

00:47:56.999 --> 00:47:58.542
It's coming together.

00:47:59.167 --> 00:48:00.794
Now I feel somewhat reassured.

00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:06.049
About Ms. Im-seon.

00:48:07.426 --> 00:48:10.554
She could have done whatever she wanted
beyond the supermarket,

00:48:11.179 --> 00:48:13.974
so I wonder why
she didn't just leave the supermarket.

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.059
That's how humans are.

00:48:16.935 --> 00:48:20.188
They dream of being king
but fear leaving their domain.

00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:24.568
They've seen how kings rule by force,
and so they wish for the same.

00:48:25.527 --> 00:48:27.654
That's the cowardly nature of humans

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:30.324
and the reason why I hate them.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.503
He may not be clueless,
but he's also not big on enlightenment.

00:48:45.088 --> 00:48:46.381
Humans hate you too.

00:48:47.841 --> 00:48:49.676
So that's another use for that.

00:48:51.303 --> 00:48:55.474
If I killed you on behalf of all humans,
would I go to heaven?

00:48:56.558 --> 00:48:58.185
You think it would end at that?

00:48:58.977 --> 00:49:00.729
He'd give you heaven if you asked.

00:49:01.313 --> 00:49:02.689
Come here. Get over here.

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:06.735
Come here.

00:49:08.862 --> 00:49:09.780
Get over here.

00:49:11.156 --> 00:49:12.616
- I said come.
- I don't want to.

00:49:12.699 --> 00:49:14.159
I LAUGH IN MY DREAMS, JOYFULLY

00:49:14.242 --> 00:49:16.662
- Let's keep it humane and…
- But you're not human.

00:49:18.372 --> 00:49:20.707
Where is that mumbling coming from?

00:49:23.502 --> 00:49:27.339
I can hear sound coming from this.
Is it a radio?

00:49:29.091 --> 00:49:30.175
Pan-geum!

00:49:30.676 --> 00:49:32.469
Pan-geum, are you home?

00:49:32.552 --> 00:49:33.887
Yes, I'm here!

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:38.100
Goodness, you came all this way
in the pouring rain?

00:49:46.191 --> 00:49:47.192
I think she said…

00:49:49.277 --> 00:49:50.654
it's raining.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.867
It seems that way, doesn't it?

00:49:56.868 --> 00:49:58.328
Do you have any alcohol here?

00:50:01.289 --> 00:50:02.124
Should I buy some?

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:06.545
Wouldn't it be faster…

00:50:08.547 --> 00:50:09.381
to go together?

00:50:12.092 --> 00:50:14.011
Don't forget we need money to buy alcohol.

00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:16.430
- This is all I need.
- You'll use that as collateral?

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:22.185
- My goodness. What shall we do?
- Grandma?

00:50:22.269 --> 00:50:24.563
Grandma, why are you crying?

00:50:24.646 --> 00:50:26.023
- Good heavens.
- What is it?

00:50:27.024 --> 00:50:28.150
Why is she crying?

00:50:28.233 --> 00:50:31.403
We just heard
that the craftsman, Mr. Kim, died.

00:50:31.486 --> 00:50:34.573
You know, the man
who taught you how to carve wood.

00:50:35.449 --> 00:50:37.325
Then why is my grandma crying?

00:50:37.409 --> 00:50:39.786
She's crying because she's sad.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:41.830
She's sad that her friend died.

00:50:41.913 --> 00:50:43.665
This is exactly why, you know.

00:50:43.749 --> 00:50:45.542
Why people call you a psycho.

00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:46.460
Heung-rye!

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:47.377
What?

00:50:48.086 --> 00:50:51.256
Goodness me!

00:50:51.339 --> 00:50:57.262
Death makes life seem so futile.

00:50:57.763 --> 00:51:02.642
It brings me to tears.

00:51:18.825 --> 00:51:20.994
My goodness.

00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:23.705
It's so tragic. I can't bear it.

00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:27.000
How can you
cast the world aside like this?

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:32.172
Even so, they say he passed peacefully
as if drifting off to sleep.

00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:33.965
Consider that a good death.

00:51:34.049 --> 00:51:36.301
There's no such thing as a good death.

00:51:37.803 --> 00:51:41.640
I guess you kids would have no idea,
with your entire lives ahead of you.

00:51:43.975 --> 00:51:46.311
I'm not afraid of dying,

00:51:46.812 --> 00:51:50.690
but if I think of my darling Ka-young…

00:51:53.527 --> 00:51:56.446
What if my heart suddenly stops

00:51:57.322 --> 00:51:59.574
or I have a stroke and collapse?

00:52:00.075 --> 00:52:03.578
What if I get cancer and diabetes
and end up with dementia too?

00:52:03.662 --> 00:52:08.458
Good heavens,
how would she ever take care of me?

00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:11.419
Why would you think such silly thoughts?

00:52:12.379 --> 00:52:16.466
At that moment, I realized that Grandma
must have read the same articles as me.

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:19.177
"An aging society is coming fast."

00:52:19.261 --> 00:52:21.471
"Prepare yourself
for age-related illness."

00:52:22.097 --> 00:52:23.807
"Medical Tomorrow."

00:52:24.766 --> 00:52:26.518
I was going to die if Grandma died,

00:52:26.601 --> 00:52:27.936
but Grandma actually wants

00:52:28.603 --> 00:52:30.564
to live a long and healthy life.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:33.233
So your point is?

00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:37.571
I'll make my second wish.

00:52:41.575 --> 00:52:44.244
Make my grandma young.

00:52:44.744 --> 00:52:45.871
The same age as me.

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:50.667
This is my second wish.

00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:27.050

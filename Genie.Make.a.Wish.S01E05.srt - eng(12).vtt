GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:08.568
So your point is?

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:09.986
I know what I want.

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:13.907
I've thought of something I don't want
taken from me. Especially by death.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:16.993
Death?

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.329
I'll make my second wish.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.413
Hold your horses.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.125
Think about it before you make your wish.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.795
Take a calm, hard look
at your deepest desires.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.964
Do you really want it enough
to sell your soul?

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.471
Make my grandma young.

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:37.889
The same age as me.

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:39.891
This

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:42.519
is my second wish.

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:48.483
But not right away
because the cremation's tomorrow.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.111
So make it happen

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:52.904
exactly 72 hours from now.

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:56.825
You're scheduling your wish?

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.247
Hawaii?

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.415
Yes. Let's go to Hawaii together.

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.459
In three days. For a change of scenery.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.045
Three days?
But if we're traveling so far, we'd need--

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.798
I've made all the preparations.
You just need to show up.

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:14.926
I've already bought the tickets.
Non-refundable.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.553
Already? Oh my.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.179
Then I'd better…

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.432
Well, we wouldn't want these
to go to waste.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.102
We have no choice but to go.

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:25.061
Goodness me.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.064
Is this real or just a dream?

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:30.859
So go and brag to all the other grannies.

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.610
Tell everyone in the village, okay?

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.404
All right.

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:35.905
CHEONGPUNG VILLAGE HALL

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:36.823
Hawaii?

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.074
Yes.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.993
I insisted it wasn't necessary,

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.871
but my Ka-young
had already bought the tickets.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:44.998
She said I needed a change of scenery.

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.416
I couldn't exactly say no.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.336
Surely she can't be making
that much money from an auto shop.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.297
I guess she saved everything she could.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.214
Oh boy.

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:56.342
You must be cashing in
all your luck late in life.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.802
I'm so jealous.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.179
So when do you leave?

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.097
You'll need to pack some kimchi
and side dishes.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.557
The day after tomorrow.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.269
I was actually thinking of heading
to the market today to make preparations.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:08.396
Do you need any groceries or anything?

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.690
She's actually going to Seoul later today.

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:12.650
For your doctor's appointment, remember?

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:16.237
You're always telling me
to go to the doctor.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.239
None of you kids ever mention Hawaii.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:19.449
All right.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.035
Let's get started with today's class.

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:25.830
All together now.
Stretch it out, nice and long.

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.165
Stretch.

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:28.374
To the right.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:29.626
To the right.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.629
Branch Manager Kang.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:34.797
Hello, Manager Kang.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.301
Apparently, Ka-young
is taking Pan-geum to Hawaii.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:42.096
She's had a tough life,
but her later years are treating her well.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:45.767
If you want to go,
you could go with your son.

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.978
Goodness, there's no need.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.898
I shouldn't waste
what little money he earns.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.694
I'll prepare for the rites
with your sister-in-law,

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.363
so don't you worry.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:00.823
All right.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.284
I can't attend anyway.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:05.995
I have to go to Seoul to see Jeong-hwa.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:09.457
Why? Did something happen to her?

00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:16.005
Where are you?

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.925
Where else would I be?
I'm at the college exam prep academy.

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:22.762
I'm at your place right now.
Do you really think I didn't check there?

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:27.433
I'm canceling your lease. Did you
keep me away just to start this crap?

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:31.854
Do you know what the hell
I just found here?

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.064
You're such a pain!

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:34.816
Who are you to snoop around my room?

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.025
I'm your mom.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.152
Do you even go to class?

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.363
Right, I wanted to talk to you about that.

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:43.199
I'm not taking the college exams
or going to college.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.077
You're not going to college?

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.998
What could you do without a degree?

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:51.749
Tell me.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.085
What is it? Go on, tell me!

00:04:54.168 --> 00:04:56.087
I can make it big without a degree!

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.674
Do you even realize
just how much of a miracle this is--

00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:00.717
I'm hanging up!

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.051
Hello?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.013
Yoo Jeong-hwa!

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:07.640
Why is this happening?

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:08.975
Seriously…

00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.573
We used to be so close…

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:27.827
when I was a supermarket cashier.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:31.539
My daughter and I.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.000
If you miss those times, simply go back.

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.421
You still have one last wish.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.923
I'm saying you can take it all back.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.852
I can't use it like that.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:56.856
It'd be a waste.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.485
I know.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.992
1,247 seconds, 1,248 seconds,

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:11.287
1,249 seconds, 1,250 seconds.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:18.378
What the… Why isn't he showing up?

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.130
What is he doing?

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:30.014
Can't you tell the time?
Ever heard of being punctual?

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:32.433
Ten seconds to go for my wish.
Is it done or not?

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:36.437
Can't you tell the time?

00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:38.940
We still have three seconds.

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:53.663
Your second wish has also been fulfilled.

00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:02.630
Grandma?

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:08.553
Gosh, what time is it?
Is it already time to go to the airport?

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:13.099
I haven't even finished packing yet.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:18.104
What's this? How did this come undone?

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:24.569
We should take
some gochujang and kimchi, right?

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:31.784
Grandma.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.287
You were this pretty?

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.580
What are you saying?

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:38.833
I'm all puffy
because I crashed right after eating.

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:42.920
What's with my voice?

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.590
You're so much prettier
than I imagined you'd be.

00:07:45.673 --> 00:07:46.799
It's too early for that.

00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:51.095
Who do you think you got those looks from?
You got them from me.

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.057
Let's see.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.187
Shouldn't we at least boil some eggs
to eat before we go?

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.273
Goodness me.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.942
Who is that? Is she a friend of yours?

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.445
No. You know Min-ji's my only friend.

00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:09.155
Then who is that?

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.452
I swear I recognize her from…

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.039
She looks so familiar…

00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:23.002
What the…

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.421
Is…

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.049
Is this a dream?

00:08:28.132 --> 00:08:29.258
Something like that.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.135
Do you know who it is now?

00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:42.396
I know who this is.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.984
This sprightly little thing is…

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:53.032
If you're going to faint,
fall to your left.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:04.043
This young lady, who once pranced around
with the whole town at her fingertips, is…

00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:09.924
If I wore some designer clothes
from Ka-young's wardrobe

00:09:10.424 --> 00:09:12.134
and some of her pointy heels…

00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:18.474
Goodness gracious. Dear Lord. Buddha.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.851
Gods of heaven and earth. Virgin Mary.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.728
Thank you.

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:27.984
It wasn't any of them.

00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:30.403
Think more Middle East.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.533
I've figured it out. It was that thing.

00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:37.577
Your notebook. Those wishes.

00:09:38.452 --> 00:09:39.996
- That's right.
- Really?

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:41.998
So there's no going back, right?

00:09:51.882 --> 00:09:53.593
What do you want with my room?

00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:55.553
Which one is Chanel?

00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:08.190
Really?

00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:12.194
So a lot happened overnight
in this tiny village.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.913
Is it me, or have you been working out
unusually hard these days?

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.207
It seems I'll be spreading
my wings more often.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:29.420
They keep tearing my clothes.

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:31.631
So you intend to fly naked?

00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:34.008
7,000 liters of water
go into making one garment.

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:37.511
So you're actually going to fly naked?

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.473
Well? Do you have something to report?

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.392
Ms. Ki Ka-young has now made
her second wish.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:44.769
A righteous one at that.

00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:46.020
Congratulations.

00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:49.690
Good intentions don't always lead
to good outcomes.

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:51.776
We can't let our guard down.

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:54.779
Where is Iblis?

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:56.614
Yeah, what?

00:10:57.114 --> 00:10:58.324
Making her grandma young?

00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:00.743
What about it? You call that righteous?

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.289
It's fine.

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:07.416
Don't sweat the small stuff.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.211
Just look at Kang Im-seon's eyes.
Perfectly wicked.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.505
Hey.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:14.131
You're the best.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.885
But why do you keep sitting like this?

00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:18.844
My damn back.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.859
Why are you intruding
on someone else's lamp?

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.696
Did you make an appointment
when you crashed my rooftop?

00:11:38.572 --> 00:11:40.449
So Irem sang like a canary again.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.954
Hey. I get you're excited
that Ki Ka-young made a righteous wish,

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:48.624
but her first wish was enough
for me to slit her throat.

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.085
So, one who was born on Wednesday,

00:11:51.168 --> 00:11:54.547
don't interrupt my precious contemplation
and get lost, will you?

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:58.676
Contemplation, my ass.
You were rattled and talking to yourself.

00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:00.302
Satan, who was born on Thursday.

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:02.304
Rattled? Me?

00:12:03.764 --> 00:12:07.226
You don't have a clue. Once you see
Gu Bo-gyeong and Eom Sang-tae…

00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:10.646
It's written all over their faces.
They will be corrupted.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:11.897
Oh, and the mutt?

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.650
Come on, you already know.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.111
I said stop disrupting the human world.

00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:19.697
If a dog becomes a man,
is that the end of it?

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.575
What about people's memories
if someone becomes young overnight?

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:24.577
Gold and riches? You know it won't work.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.913
You can't deposit over ten million
without providing a source!

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:29.874
Your methods? They're so old-school.

00:12:29.957 --> 00:12:33.002
You no longer have a use in this world.

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:34.378
Even so,

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:36.172
how could you say such…

00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:39.258
You're gassing me, you know.

00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:40.509
"Gaslighting."

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:43.596
Sade, that jerk!

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.267
What will you do
if I prove that I do have a use?

00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:51.187
Mr. Genie?

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:53.105
Where are you?

00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:56.150
Do your best to prove it, then.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.028
Everyone will start seeking you out now.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.822
As long as you're not seeking me out.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.200
Yes, I'm coming, Mutt.

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:06.202
Where are you right now?

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.000
Help me live like an actual person.

00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:16.295
I look like a person.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.464
But as for what I can do…

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:22.009
I can't do anything.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:24.762
That's your second wish?

00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:27.056
It's the same as your first.

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:30.351
What's with the manner of speech?
Is it a shtick?

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.020
My dad

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:34.939
was a foreign dog.

00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:36.273
Anyway,

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:39.193
I need money. And ID.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.154
I must have money and ID.

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:47.701
I also find modern society so hard.

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:50.996
And I suddenly have five wish-makers.

00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:56.710
I'm just as baffled as you.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.171
All right. How about this?

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:02.216
I'll turn you into someone
who doesn't need ID.

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:05.886
What kind of person would that be?

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.596
The kind of person who pays

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.558
to hire people who do have IDs.

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:16.063
GOBLIN STATIONERY

00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:18.983
The key here is wet hair.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:23.320
A man who'd rather boil to death in a suit
steps out of the driver's seat.

00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:26.407
And you?

00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:28.701
You're in the back seat.

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:33.664
Hey. Look over there.

00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:35.416
- Where?
- Damn.

00:14:35.499 --> 00:14:37.626
Looks like the fucking top dog.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.254
How did that motherfucker
end up with a car like that?

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.755
I'm damn jealous.

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:43.799
He probably worked like a dog.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:46.427
I wish I had
a dogshit ton of money to flaunt too.

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:57.479
He's coming this way.

00:14:59.106 --> 00:14:59.940
Hey, you punks.

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:06.405
You once kicked a dog
in this alleyway, didn't you?

00:15:06.488 --> 00:15:08.699
Are you familiar with cocker spaniels?

00:15:08.782 --> 00:15:10.951
You mean one
of the top three unhinged breeds?

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.954
So what if we are? Oh, are you that dog?

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.168
Then I guess you know
why I'm doing this too?

00:15:21.962 --> 00:15:22.796
The hell?

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.214
Hey, are you okay?

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:27.176
- This motherfucker!
- You crazy fuck!

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.845
Hey, you son of a bitch!

00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:42.942
For your troubles.

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.486
And don't ever mess with dogs again.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.197
I'll be watching you.

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:51.283
Hey. The money. Pick up the money.

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:52.701
Just pick it up already.

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:04.588
Damn it.

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:16.266
I can't believe
your passcode is actually 1004.

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:24.775
Damn it.

00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:32.116
Iblis, you satanic asshole!

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:38.038
Grandma?

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:41.959
Grandma?

00:16:57.933 --> 00:16:59.727
A leather jacket in this heat?

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:18.495
Chanel.

00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:37.848
Grandm…

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:05.209
I'm not out of breath.
Not even close to exhausted.

00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:07.336
My hip is like new.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.682
Grandma, watch out!

00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:32.903
You good, son?

00:18:34.863 --> 00:18:36.990
You should respect your elders,
young lady.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:38.492
"Young lady"?

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.161
"Young lady"?

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:44.665
"Young lady"!

00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:06.895
Grandma's going to need some rules too.

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:15.404
Aren't you hot?

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:17.990
No way.

00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:20.075
I'm at the perfect temperature. Why?

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:23.453
Everything I say now
is a rule you must follow, no matter what.

00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:27.124
First, never answer this phone.

00:19:27.207 --> 00:19:29.835
Never. Not with this new
nightingale voice of mine.

00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:31.503
I won't answer.

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.380
New cell phone, okay. What else?

00:19:33.463 --> 00:19:34.673
By the way…

00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:36.800
Second, if anyone asks why you're here?

00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:38.427
For a six-month countryside stay.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.720
Third. From where?

00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:43.724
- Hadong?
- Hey, Ki Ka-young?

00:19:43.807 --> 00:19:45.976
But Hadong's out in the country too.

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:48.312
Say you're from Cheongdam, Seoul.
And your name…

00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:49.354
I already picked one.

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.565
Lee Mi-ju. Suits me, doesn't it?

00:19:51.648 --> 00:19:54.484
Great. Fourth.
Drop that dialect from now on.

00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:57.779
This is between him, you, and me.

00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:00.657
So you need to stick to the rules
and not get caught. Got it?

00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:03.535
Come on, now.
Do you think I'm some nitwit?

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:04.912
When I was young…

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.664
Hold up, I am young now.

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:11.835
The thing is, I just want to know
what's on the menu for dinner tonight--

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:14.254
You don't even need to eat.
Why are you pigging out?

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.381
Grandma. Use a Seoul dialect.

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:20.928
Goodness gracious!

00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:22.846
That scared the daylights out of me!

00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:28.393
Oh, sorry. That freaks me out every time.

00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:30.479
Anyway, when I was young,

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:32.898
I was also pretty chic and had big dreams.

00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:36.777
Do you still need to go to the salon
to enter the Miss Korea pageant?

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.904
You have a monolid.
You wouldn't make the cut.

00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:42.366
Don't think about anything else.
Just go and do something about your hair.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.202
Shouldn't I get eyelid surgery first?

00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:47.579
So stingy about food.

00:20:48.163 --> 00:20:49.873
I don't even eat that much.

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:54.586
Gosh, this young man sure got here early.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.464
He looks strong too.
He'll probably get picked first.

00:20:57.547 --> 00:20:59.466
Move over a little. Scooch over.

00:21:00.008 --> 00:21:02.010
- Thanks.
- Go on, scooch over.

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.054
There you go. That's it.

00:21:04.137 --> 00:21:06.515
- Wait, I…
- Just a little more. That's it.

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:07.808
They'll fall off.

00:21:08.308 --> 00:21:10.477
Okay, I need people
to work the cabbage patch.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.853
First 15.

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:14.022
- Me!
- Hey, me!

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.525
What are you doing?
Are you all uncomfortable?

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:18.860
Me too!

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.405
I'm very uncomfortable. Me!

00:21:21.488 --> 00:21:22.322
Here, me!

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:23.949
I'm extremely uncomfortable!

00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:48.974
Come and have your meals!

00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:50.350
Enjoy your meals.

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:52.894
- I know, right?
- Did someone go buy rice wine?

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.147
- He's on his way to buy it.
- Right away?

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.565
He's off to get it.

00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:57.858
Wow, this is…

00:21:57.941 --> 00:22:01.111
- Goodness, thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:05.782
Eating without paying? Seriously?

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:09.703
Thanks to you, we can call it a day now.

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:11.580
Here.

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:14.875
- What is this?
- Your pay for the day.

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:17.210
I get paid too?

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:21.298
- Thank you.
- Incredible!

00:22:23.467 --> 00:22:24.968
I thought I was going to die.

00:22:25.052 --> 00:22:27.387
You here? Go on, sit.

00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:29.639
Scooch over. Come on.

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:33.518
- Hey.
- You're here again!

00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:34.561
Hi, Mr. Kim.

00:23:03.507 --> 00:23:04.341
What is this?

00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:15.519
What a fucking pain in the ass.

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:19.106
You should have just died.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.616
Who are you?

00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:31.034
Where did you come…

00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:36.581
Did you see that?

00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:39.960
Yes, I saw it all.
But that's not important.

00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:43.422
I am Genie, the lamp spirit.
I shall grant you three wishes.

00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:45.090
No reviving or going to the future.

00:23:45.173 --> 00:23:48.176
Anything besides that,
your wish is my command.

00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:51.054
Mister, are you drunk or something?

00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:53.265
Just go on your merry way.

00:23:53.348 --> 00:23:55.976
And know you're only alive
because you're a guy.

00:23:57.436 --> 00:23:58.437
You can see me?

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.355
Man, I was in a rush and came as myself!

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:03.817
I was first in line too.
Now hurry, what's your first wish?

00:24:04.317 --> 00:24:05.402
What a joke.

00:24:06.194 --> 00:24:08.488
Who the fuck
let this moron out this early?

00:24:08.572 --> 00:24:09.990
You're a genie?

00:24:10.991 --> 00:24:12.325
Then bring this back to life.

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:16.455
Thank you so much for your prompt wish.

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:18.957
It's possible
because it's still breathing.

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:31.803
Look at it go.

00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:34.723
Shall we keep it rolling
and get to your second wish?

00:24:36.683 --> 00:24:38.477
Fuck!

00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:40.770
This is real?

00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:43.482
That's seriously fucked up!

00:24:44.357 --> 00:24:46.776
You should have told me that it was real!

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.614
I just blew a wish on nothing,
you motherfucker!

00:25:05.378 --> 00:25:06.630
You fucking moron.

00:25:08.089 --> 00:25:10.759
If you're a genie,
that makes me your master.

00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:12.052
Treat me like it, damn it!

00:25:12.135 --> 00:25:14.888
Why should I? That's a misconception.

00:25:14.971 --> 00:25:17.641
I may grant wishes,
but I can also have a nasty temper.

00:25:21.228 --> 00:25:22.437
Like this.

00:25:28.318 --> 00:25:31.696
Just a moment. Please.

00:25:32.572 --> 00:25:34.824
So that means
I have two wishes left, right?

00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:47.921
Wait, where did the lamp go?
Why can't I see it?

00:25:48.004 --> 00:25:51.675
The lamp will appear when you desire
something enough to wish for it.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.678
Give it careful thought
before summoning me.

00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:57.681
And don't bother trying to control me,
you lowly human.

00:25:59.307 --> 00:26:02.269
And there's no point
trying to remember my face.

00:26:03.103 --> 00:26:05.313
I'll look different to you anyway.

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:16.199
Fucking piece of shit!

00:26:18.618 --> 00:26:20.120
Good morning, Homies!

00:26:20.203 --> 00:26:23.206
We're up early today
to plant some lettuce.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.709
A lot of you struggle
with insomnia, don't you?

00:26:25.792 --> 00:26:27.210
I have bad insomnia too.

00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:29.337
So I'll grow these and "roar!"

00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:31.089
Gobble them all up.

00:26:31.172 --> 00:26:35.719
All right, lettuce seedlings
need to be planted 20 centimeters apart.

00:26:35.802 --> 00:26:38.013
Let's plant one here, and…

00:26:39.306 --> 00:26:40.932
Another one over here.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.393
One here.

00:26:46.563 --> 00:26:48.523
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT!
YOU'RE KILLING ME! - ZOOM IN MORE!

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:52.569
I think we'll end today's live here.
See you again when the lettuce has grown!

00:26:52.652 --> 00:26:54.154
Hey, what? Why are you…

00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.533
What was that? They were loving it!

00:26:59.409 --> 00:27:01.328
- You zoomed in again, didn't you?
- What?

00:27:02.537 --> 00:27:05.457
Well, you know,
you leaned over, and I was just filming.

00:27:06.041 --> 00:27:08.543
What did you say? You sick bastard.

00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:11.546
Here. I present to you my left cheek.

00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:16.343
Come on, they say to love thy enemies.

00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:21.973
- You sly dog. You deserve a smack!
- Hey, come on. Quit it!

00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:25.393
I've looked into it,
and you know that sleazy guy?

00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:29.314
This country has a university
that's really good in terms of science.

00:27:29.397 --> 00:27:31.399
That's where the two met.

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:33.777
Really? What did they do?

00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:37.989
They were in the waltz club.

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:39.741
What?

00:27:41.368 --> 00:27:42.702
Waltz?

00:27:54.297 --> 00:27:55.298
How unexpected.

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:57.926
I didn't think you'd be into waltzing.

00:27:58.009 --> 00:27:59.678
I wasn't interested at first,

00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:02.430
but a hometown friend of mine
suggested it,

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:04.766
saying it's better
to break down beats than heads.

00:28:06.976 --> 00:28:08.770
You sure are quirky.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:12.732
By the way, I saw you turned down
the President's Scholarship again.

00:28:12.816 --> 00:28:17.278
Thanks to you, I get to study abroad.
Maybe a research lab in the Arab League.

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:18.196
Thanks.

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:19.614
Don't mention it.

00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:22.242
I'm loaded,
so I could pay for the trip myself.

00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:26.162
Didn't you say you were from a small town
somewhere in Chungcheong-do?

00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:27.956
Our chili crops are booming.

00:28:31.292 --> 00:28:32.544
Man, you're so…

00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:45.765
- I'm the best here, right?
- Yeah.

00:28:50.019 --> 00:28:52.063
- Are you okay?
- There's nothing there.

00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:53.523
- What's with you?
- Damn it.

00:28:53.606 --> 00:28:54.441
What's wrong?

00:28:54.524 --> 00:28:56.609
You sure did fall over
in a very quirky manner.

00:28:56.693 --> 00:28:58.445
- What's gotten into you?
- What is it?

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.615
Is your face okay?

00:29:02.699 --> 00:29:04.033
That's where you fell, right?

00:29:04.117 --> 00:29:05.118
Who is this bastard--

00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:08.121
Come on, you're hurt.
Don't bother trying to answer.

00:29:08.204 --> 00:29:11.416
Does it hurt a lot?
Did you break this bone here?

00:29:34.814 --> 00:29:35.648
We have guests.

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:47.744
What's with this savage place?

00:29:49.746 --> 00:29:51.289
Will you even get a word in?

00:29:51.372 --> 00:29:53.500
It sure seems like… How should I put it?

00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:55.043
Not like an ordinary home.

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:57.003
Right. It really does draw you in.

00:29:57.587 --> 00:29:59.130
Don't be a scaredy pants.

00:29:59.714 --> 00:30:00.548
Right.

00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:02.884
You sure have a large family.

00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:04.844
What? Are you all brothers?

00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:07.931
How patriotic of your parents.
Are we still waiting on the adults?

00:30:08.014 --> 00:30:09.349
Can I help you?

00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:13.186
Right, I guess introductions
are a little overdue.

00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:15.814
I'm the chief of Cheongpung Village--

00:30:15.897 --> 00:30:17.524
I asked if I can help you.

00:30:19.025 --> 00:30:21.486
Well, we heard you'd moved in,

00:30:21.569 --> 00:30:23.488
but you haven't shown your face.

00:30:23.571 --> 00:30:26.491
You need to complete resident forms,
but we didn't bring enough.

00:30:26.574 --> 00:30:28.827
We didn't know your family was so large.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.788
Local village news
is posted regularly on the Band channel,

00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:33.706
so make sure you're subscribed.

00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:36.626
Punch your number in.

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:41.881
Goodness, I'm so forgetful.
I almost waited to ask you next year.

00:30:41.965 --> 00:30:43.842
- Your name is?
- It's Jung Jun-u.

00:30:43.925 --> 00:30:46.511
Hey, give him your number.

00:30:53.893 --> 00:30:55.812
I wasn't done talking over here…

00:31:05.947 --> 00:31:06.948
What was that?

00:31:15.331 --> 00:31:16.499
What are you doing?

00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:17.709
Protecting Grandma.

00:31:19.294 --> 00:31:22.589
It all rides on keeping this quiet.
See if the screen's getting an image.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.591
Is that your third wish?

00:31:24.674 --> 00:31:26.426
If you're not going to help, piss off.

00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:30.638
Is that your third wish?

00:31:31.973 --> 00:31:34.058
Why are you on about wishes again?

00:31:35.184 --> 00:31:38.229
I grew up to be so pretty with no scars.

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:43.902
When I was eight,
you told me not to get hurt.

00:31:45.528 --> 00:31:47.113
Haven't you heard of white lies?

00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:50.450
All lies are bad.
They steal chances to grow.

00:31:51.492 --> 00:31:54.537
Is that why you're working so hard
to install security cameras?

00:31:54.621 --> 00:31:56.664
Because you're so honest, Ki Ka-young?

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.896
Hey, why aren't you barking at me? Huh?

00:32:25.568 --> 00:32:27.820
I swear this is the spot. Where is it?

00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:31.032
Darn it.

00:32:33.576 --> 00:32:34.911
The money isn't there.

00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:37.080
It hasn't been for ten years.

00:32:37.163 --> 00:32:38.373
You startled me, you brat.

00:32:38.998 --> 00:32:40.917
I nearly had a heart attack.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.710
Unlikely. Your heart's young now.

00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:46.339
I dug up all the money you buried
and donated it.

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:48.132
What?

00:32:49.384 --> 00:32:50.802
How did you know about it?

00:32:50.885 --> 00:32:53.262
Wait. All of it? There was so much.

00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:56.724
- Just the starting amount.
- Just the starting amount?

00:33:02.105 --> 00:33:03.898
So you made some money off it?

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:06.150
Hand it over. Let's split it 50-50.

00:33:06.234 --> 00:33:09.570
Even grandparents get paid
to babysit these days, you know.

00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:11.823
Half would be way too much.

00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:14.993
I've made a killing with it in stocks.

00:33:15.785 --> 00:33:16.703
Stocks?

00:33:18.579 --> 00:33:19.956
That thing you had me sign?

00:33:21.374 --> 00:33:23.418
Aggressive investing
as a mere high schooler?

00:33:28.214 --> 00:33:30.174
I saw all the stocks
you bought skyrocketing

00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:32.301
and thought you were
possessed or something.

00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:35.179
But then you used that money
to pay my college tuition,

00:33:35.263 --> 00:33:37.724
and you became
a god-like figure to my mom.

00:33:37.807 --> 00:33:39.934
I thought to myself,
"You're actually someone's god."

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:40.935
"How awesome."

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:44.856
"I'm finally escaping this town.
How exciting!"

00:33:44.939 --> 00:33:45.940
Are you done eating?

00:33:46.774 --> 00:33:49.485
It just came out, so of course not.
Not by a long shot.

00:33:50.903 --> 00:33:53.573
What are you staring at anyway?
Is something going on?

00:33:53.656 --> 00:33:54.907
I want to hurry home.

00:33:54.991 --> 00:33:55.950
Why?

00:33:56.492 --> 00:33:57.618
Because of that jerk?

00:33:57.702 --> 00:34:00.913
I told you not to get too serious
with some jerk you don't know.

00:34:02.165 --> 00:34:04.834
Hey, what are you doing here?

00:34:04.917 --> 00:34:07.420
Didn't you go to Hawaii with Pan-geum?

00:34:10.423 --> 00:34:12.216
Something came up, so I couldn't go,

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.302
but Grandma
didn't want to waste the ticket.

00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:17.847
She went on her own so she wouldn't waste
the swimsuit she'd bought.

00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:18.973
Alone?

00:34:20.683 --> 00:34:23.478
And why isn't she answering her phone?

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:27.607
It's a long flight, a different time zone,
and with no roaming, no news is good news.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.860
Grandma went to Hawaii? Alone?

00:34:31.652 --> 00:34:34.655
Goodness, she's always so damn tactless.

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.075
You could've given me the spare ticket.

00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:39.285
What use is an unused ticket?

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.288
Pack up a large to go for me.

00:34:42.371 --> 00:34:45.625
That one's just incapable
of thinking about others.

00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:47.460
No wonder no one speaks well of you.

00:34:47.543 --> 00:34:48.544
Right. To go.

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.380
I'll get the rest of this to go.

00:34:51.964 --> 00:34:54.383
- I'll eat this at home.
- Then what about me?

00:34:54.884 --> 00:34:56.761
I'm still eating.

00:34:56.844 --> 00:34:59.222
SOYEON SALON

00:35:04.018 --> 00:35:05.353
Move!

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:06.521
Hey, watch out!

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:18.491
Hey, jackass! It's illegal
to ride scooters on sidewalks!

00:35:18.574 --> 00:35:19.867
I saw your face, you know.

00:35:22.453 --> 00:35:23.287
Are you all right?

00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:25.123
Goodness me, young lady!

00:35:25.206 --> 00:35:28.000
Min-ji, you really take no nonsense…

00:35:31.045 --> 00:35:32.255
do you, miss?

00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:34.215
Do you know me?

00:35:36.759 --> 00:35:39.428
You own the dental clinic over there.

00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:41.264
You're quite famous.

00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:46.269
I'm Lee Mi-ju, and I'm here
for a six-month countryside stay.

00:35:46.352 --> 00:35:49.939
I read Smile Dental Clinic's a must
when visiting Cheongpung,

00:35:50.022 --> 00:35:52.024
so I was just thinking about when to go.

00:35:52.108 --> 00:35:53.401
You were?

00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:55.653
Please do. Come whenever.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.448
But judging by that smile just now,
you don't have any teeth to fix.

00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:03.494
Holy smokes.
My teeth must have gotten younger too.

00:36:03.578 --> 00:36:05.705
You must be from Gyeongsang-do.

00:36:06.247 --> 00:36:08.166
Where are you staying?

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.334
Well, I…

00:36:13.546 --> 00:36:16.340
I'm sure we'll bump into each other again,
don't you think?

00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:17.842
If fate would have it.

00:36:19.093 --> 00:36:19.927
Well, sure.

00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:22.889
And if you're going to get your hair done…

00:36:22.972 --> 00:36:24.765
You have an excellent jawline,

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:27.894
so a simple blowout
could add some character

00:36:27.977 --> 00:36:29.187
while keeping your volume.

00:36:40.281 --> 00:36:43.075
A blowout?
Does she realize how much that costs?

00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:46.412
I could do that myself at home.
Why would I come to a salon?

00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:49.582
Shall we, then?

00:36:59.383 --> 00:37:01.093
I heard you have something to say.

00:37:01.594 --> 00:37:02.720
It's nothing major.

00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:06.182
You were classmates
with Ms. Ki Ka-young, right?

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:08.726
We weren't close, so…

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.978
What's for lunch today?

00:37:13.147 --> 00:37:16.776
You may not have been close,
but you're not complete strangers, right?

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.071
Must I really spell it out?

00:37:20.154 --> 00:37:22.865
Do I really need to be doing this?
I should be home by now.

00:37:22.949 --> 00:37:26.786
All right, look.
You know our new pension package?

00:37:26.869 --> 00:37:30.081
The only VIP we have
who can comfortably afford that package

00:37:30.164 --> 00:37:32.124
is Ms. Ki Ka-young, you know?

00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:35.503
You could go and see her
and do some… you know?

00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:38.130
Can't you take some initiative
for a change?

00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:40.091
I'll think about it.

00:37:40.174 --> 00:37:43.219
Now is not the time
to say you'll think about it!

00:37:43.302 --> 00:37:46.222
I've already done
all the thinking for you.

00:37:46.847 --> 00:37:50.643
Work it out over the weekend, all right?

00:38:22.258 --> 00:38:23.175
A kettle?

00:38:26.429 --> 00:38:29.515
Who the hell used this thing
that's a bitch to clean?

00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:37.690
What is this?

00:38:38.274 --> 00:38:39.900
Is this micro dust or what?

00:38:51.454 --> 00:38:54.373
I am Genie, the lamp spirit.

00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:57.668
I shall grant you three wishes. Make them.

00:38:58.586 --> 00:38:59.920
No bringing back the dead.

00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:02.006
No traveling to the future.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:04.342
- Anything besides that--
- A genie?

00:39:07.887 --> 00:39:10.097
Wait, I'm not quite done explain…

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.524
I honestly had faith, you know.

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:24.028
I truly believed
that a day like this would come.

00:39:24.111 --> 00:39:26.322
I haven't had
such a quick response in some time.

00:39:26.405 --> 00:39:28.032
I'll make a wish.

00:39:28.115 --> 00:39:29.283
For my first wish…

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:32.745
Ki Ka-young, she runs an auto shop.

00:39:36.665 --> 00:39:37.500
And?

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:41.045
GU BO-GYEONG
JUNE 20, 2024

00:39:41.128 --> 00:39:43.464
MADE HER FIRST WISH

00:39:44.298 --> 00:39:46.592
All right. What was Gu Bo-gyeong's wish?

00:39:48.135 --> 00:39:50.179
Tell me quick. I need to go get a refund.

00:39:50.971 --> 00:39:53.557
- I'm even dressed for the occasion.
- Dressed for a refund?

00:39:53.641 --> 00:39:56.102
I got a used spanner set,
but the fourth one's missing.

00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:58.020
I really like the number four.

00:39:58.771 --> 00:40:00.022
I won't allow it.

00:40:02.441 --> 00:40:04.568
Blood on white clothes.
Now that'd be pretty.

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:06.487
So hurry up and tell me.

00:40:07.154 --> 00:40:08.906
What did Gu Bo-gyeong wish for?

00:40:10.616 --> 00:40:13.953
Give me all the money
that's in Ki Ka-young's account.

00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:18.916
You want to be rich like Ki Ka-young?

00:40:18.999 --> 00:40:20.418
No. That's not it.

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:24.171
I want all the money
that's in Ki Ka-young's account.

00:40:26.048 --> 00:40:27.258
Every last cent.

00:40:30.219 --> 00:40:31.053
I see.

00:40:32.847 --> 00:40:34.849
You want Ki Ka-young's misfortune.

00:40:39.812 --> 00:40:41.897
What should I do?

00:40:51.657 --> 00:40:52.867
It is done.

00:40:53.659 --> 00:40:54.660
Really?

00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:01.417
DEPOSIT, KI KA-YOUNG
10,000,000 WON

00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:07.882
And your second wish?

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:09.884
Wait, just a moment.

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:12.219
I don't have to make it right away, do I?

00:41:15.389 --> 00:41:16.432
For now…

00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:21.270
I just want to cherish this moment.

00:41:28.694 --> 00:41:32.448
Ki Ka-young, who said humans are kind,
has appeared in another's wish.

00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:33.949
Still believe in humans?

00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:36.118
It does make me angry
how she singled me out.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.622
But a bet is still a bet.

00:41:42.374 --> 00:41:44.835
Kang Im-seon, Eom Sang-tae,
and Gu Bo-gyeong.

00:41:45.961 --> 00:41:47.796
I think I'll be winning this bet.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.759
WANTED EVERYTHING
IN KI KA-YOUNG'S ACCOUNT, EVERY LAST CENT

00:41:53.052 --> 00:41:53.886
Yes.

00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.517
It does seem to be heading that way.

00:42:02.811 --> 00:42:04.230
So just stay still.

00:42:12.738 --> 00:42:13.989
What are you doing?

00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:18.536
You asked to be taken care of.
So I'm doing just that.

00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:20.162
I can't do this if I lose.

00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:26.752
Boy, my dear Lee Beul-li is warm.

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:30.422
My darling Satan sure is warm.

00:42:32.925 --> 00:42:35.511
My dear Iblis is so warm.

00:43:00.869 --> 00:43:02.788
I've been curious for a while.

00:43:03.872 --> 00:43:06.959
Why doesn't that hourglass flow?
Doesn't that mean it has no purpose?

00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:09.336
Because it's a coffin, not a clock.

00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:14.717
That's you in there.
I was locked up with a handful of you.

00:43:15.634 --> 00:43:16.468
A coffin?

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.356
So a coffin can actually be this tiny.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.985
Damn, I got mine down
to a size five Korea Post box.

00:43:33.736 --> 00:43:35.821
We were so warm just now.

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:38.365
Are you seriously flash-freezing me out?

00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:45.456
Did you hold ancestral rites for me?

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.687
Cast the Goryeo bitch aside too!

00:44:08.771 --> 00:44:09.938
Please.

00:44:22.618 --> 00:44:23.452
What is it?

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.621
So it really was me.

00:44:26.288 --> 00:44:27.706
The laughing girl in my dreams.

00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:30.876
I've dreamed about this place.

00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:34.838
The decor is a little different,

00:44:35.756 --> 00:44:37.132
but it was definitely here.

00:44:39.635 --> 00:44:41.428
I was laughing here.

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:42.888
What are you talking about?

00:44:43.389 --> 00:44:46.350
You've never been in here.
Not once in the past.

00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:49.061
Then did I see the future?

00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:50.813
It was definitely me.

00:44:51.563 --> 00:44:53.524
I was smiling. Like this.

00:44:57.444 --> 00:44:58.362
That creepily?

00:45:03.617 --> 00:45:05.411
Where did you hide my toolbox?

00:45:14.002 --> 00:45:15.337
You should've taken it in.

00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:19.466
Even if there are issues, I'll need to
order parts, so I can't fix it right away.

00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:21.969
It's all right. Just do a regular checkup.

00:45:23.303 --> 00:45:25.889
Wait here.
I need to go to the bank quickly.

00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:39.278
Look away.
I don't like it when people watch me.

00:45:46.702 --> 00:45:49.705
Is it okay for an adult
to speak so harshly to a child?

00:45:49.788 --> 00:45:51.498
You think being young gives you a pass?

00:45:52.666 --> 00:45:54.585
Go sit over there and read your book.

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:56.253
I've already finished it.

00:45:56.336 --> 00:45:57.171
HISTORY OF GORYEO

00:45:57.254 --> 00:46:00.674
In Goryeo times, Arabia was called
Abbasid, and the two had close ties.

00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:03.510
But the exchanges stopped
after the year 1040.

00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:05.053
I wonder why.

00:46:05.137 --> 00:46:06.472
Did someone block the path?

00:46:06.555 --> 00:46:07.765
It wasn't me.

00:46:07.848 --> 00:46:10.184
Do you know "Twin Flower Shop"?
The Goryeo-era song?

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:13.979
They say the foreign man in the song
was actually an Arabian merchant.

00:46:14.062 --> 00:46:16.356
If he came all the way to Goryeo
from Arabia,

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.860
there must be people who traveled
from Goryeo to Arabia, right?

00:46:19.943 --> 00:46:22.029
Ask the Internet, not the auto shop.

00:46:23.197 --> 00:46:24.823
What is it now?

00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:26.950
Hey, part-timer!

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:30.078
Did you call me?

00:46:30.162 --> 00:46:31.580
Watch the shop for a bit.

00:46:31.663 --> 00:46:33.499
Those are some of my favorite heels!

00:46:49.056 --> 00:46:49.890
Wait.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.156
Let's see.

00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:11.411
Come on. What's wrong with this thing?

00:47:13.789 --> 00:47:15.958
If you're getting coffee, this one's good.

00:47:16.458 --> 00:47:19.127
So we did run into each other. Like fate.

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.755
It's such a small town.

00:47:22.631 --> 00:47:23.882
You go first.

00:47:23.966 --> 00:47:27.678
So you weren't wondering what to drink.
Haven't you used a kiosk before?

00:47:27.761 --> 00:47:29.346
Well, about that…

00:47:29.429 --> 00:47:31.431
So you always had someone
to do it for you?

00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:33.851
Who were the jerks who did it all for you?

00:47:35.477 --> 00:47:37.479
This coffee tastes better
with an extra shot.

00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:41.775
Why are you laughing?

00:47:43.652 --> 00:47:46.071
Because I'm grateful, and you're cute.

00:47:46.154 --> 00:47:48.156
That's a pretty dangerous thing to say.

00:47:48.782 --> 00:47:50.868
You straightened your hair. It's pretty.

00:47:52.286 --> 00:47:53.996
It's not pretty at all.

00:47:54.079 --> 00:47:55.539
It's… Oh!

00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:58.542
Maybe it's because my clothes
are doing all the work.

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:00.127
Your clothes

00:48:01.128 --> 00:48:01.962
are a no.

00:48:02.629 --> 00:48:04.006
What?

00:48:09.928 --> 00:48:10.888
Oh gosh.

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:13.140
What are you doing?

00:48:14.933 --> 00:48:16.393
Keeping an eye on Grandma.

00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:18.437
But she keeps laughing.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.563
Look.

00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:21.356
True joy.

00:48:22.649 --> 00:48:23.483
Why is that?

00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:26.445
They grow up so fast.

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:29.823
Damn it.

00:48:30.782 --> 00:48:32.659
She should just live with Min-ji, then.

00:48:35.954 --> 00:48:36.955
By the way,

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:40.792
about that thing where you show me care.

00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:43.420
What are the rules for that?

00:48:44.504 --> 00:48:46.548
Is it the time, the place,

00:48:46.632 --> 00:48:49.009
the day, or the outfit?

00:48:50.344 --> 00:48:51.428
Does it matter?

00:48:52.387 --> 00:48:54.598
I feel like trash, so don't talk to me.

00:49:00.228 --> 00:49:01.563
Come on.

00:49:09.905 --> 00:49:12.532
No, that's not it!

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:13.951
Seriously.

00:49:16.536 --> 00:49:17.621
That's not it!

00:49:19.873 --> 00:49:21.792
Iblis!

00:49:29.007 --> 00:49:30.842
Why aren't they coming out?

00:49:37.391 --> 00:49:38.725
You, come with me.

00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:56.785
You completely emptied my safe

00:49:57.869 --> 00:50:00.247
and gave that huge amount of money

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:01.248
to that mutt.

00:50:01.873 --> 00:50:03.875
You told me to consider modern systems.

00:50:05.377 --> 00:50:08.463
That was the only money
that was free from modern-day systems.

00:50:09.047 --> 00:50:10.382
And he's not a mutt.

00:50:11.299 --> 00:50:13.927
His dad's actually from England
and has quite the pedigree.

00:50:28.984 --> 00:50:30.902
Why gouge out the angels' eyes?

00:50:31.778 --> 00:50:34.406
Isn't that how
the painting was originally?

00:50:35.115 --> 00:50:36.783
Originally? Originally!

00:50:37.576 --> 00:50:39.703
You know what it took to restore it?

00:50:42.748 --> 00:50:43.957
I can't take it anymore.

00:50:57.679 --> 00:50:58.722
Deary me.

00:51:45.018 --> 00:51:46.520
Iblis!

00:52:24.266 --> 00:52:25.475
Please.

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:28.311
What could it be? The sword?

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:30.522
- Please.
- The reaping hook?

00:52:30.605 --> 00:52:32.315
- Please.
- The axe?

00:52:32.399 --> 00:52:33.608
Please.

00:52:36.736 --> 00:52:40.198
I must have asked for a sword
that can cut a head clean off. Yes.

00:53:08.602 --> 00:53:10.437
Why would you come to my house?

00:53:11.813 --> 00:53:13.607
Don't tell me you came for my grandma.

00:53:14.816 --> 00:53:15.734
If so, you're dead.

00:53:15.817 --> 00:53:18.153
You may be the lamp's master,
but you can't kill me.

00:53:19.571 --> 00:53:21.948
- And I'm here to see you.
- Me?

00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:24.743
So I'm dying?

00:53:25.577 --> 00:53:26.661
Don't worry about that.

00:53:27.746 --> 00:53:29.331
Not for today, at least.

00:53:31.333 --> 00:53:33.543
I know you made your second wish.

00:53:36.296 --> 00:53:38.173
What does that have to do with you?

00:53:41.343 --> 00:53:43.178
I thought I might help you

00:53:43.678 --> 00:53:45.222
decide on your final wish.

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:52.312
Do you know the reason Iblis

00:53:53.271 --> 00:53:54.189
wants to kill you?

00:53:54.272 --> 00:53:56.399
Because I locked him up in his lamp.

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.276
So he wants to get revenge.

00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.653
That's right.

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:02.072
Then what might be the reason you died?

00:54:05.992 --> 00:54:07.118
Aren't you curious…

00:54:11.164 --> 00:54:12.666
about what happened?

00:54:14.292 --> 00:54:15.669
Won't you come with me…

00:54:18.463 --> 00:54:19.839
to the moment you died?

00:57:56.139 --> 00:58:01.144

GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.031
Won't you come with me

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:14.949
to the moment you died?

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.288
How could I trust you?

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.460
I followed his orders
and bowed before the first human.

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:30.256
Iblis has been my brother for the longest
and my enemy for just as long.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.219
Iblis is trying to kill you,
Ms. Ki Ka-young.

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.137
The enemy of an enemy…

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:39.307
is surely a friend?

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:58.409
Piss off.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.121
- Why?
- Your face just now.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.831
You were being deceptive.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:06.501
What? Did you bite your tongue?

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.421
Someone just whacked my master.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:11.673
Really?

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:14.926
Someone who would beat up Ejllael?
I only know of two.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.267
One of them is occupied, which means…

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:27.397
I have to get to work
early tomorrow, so I'm off.

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:32.360
Good morning, Ms. Ki.

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:35.822
Did something happen?

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:38.158
We're with the police.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:42.662
Did Ejllael report you for assault?
He is a stickler for protocol.

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:45.290
I think you're the one
who's ratting me out right now.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.376
They're on a missing persons case.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.006
Do you recognize this woman?
This village was her last known location.

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:57.635
I tend to track things by scent.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.764
We haven't seen her.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.017
Could I take a picture of this?

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.976
Sure.

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.605
Please do get in touch
if anything comes to mind.

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:38.968
BLACK HAIR DYE

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:45.266
That's strange. I was just here last week.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.227
Why'd they request another visit so soon?

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.774
Anyone home? Ms. Shin Suk-ja?
It's your water filter technician.

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.402
What's that smell?

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.906
Apparently, she died alone.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.241
Who found her?

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:03.952
Her kids must not have checked in on her.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.664
Why do you always handle things
in such a complicated manner?

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:11.709
If I am to keep accompanying
those who die alone,

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.878
I must adapt to human protocol.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.881
I made every report myself
until about 40 years ago.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.133
I was really busy back then.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.512
I'd listen to the dying's last complaints
and file the reports,

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:23.972
all in heavy clothes.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:27.225
I can't.

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:29.560
I can't leave my sick girl behind.
I just can't.

00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:33.731
Please give me more time
until my granddaughter gets better.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:34.857
Please.

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.277
You don't have to worry about that.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:38.820
It's not you.

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:40.697
It's her.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:43.658
No, it can't be!

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.702
Then the police started looking for me.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.912
Because death follows me everywhere.

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:50.540
I'm probably still wanted by Interpol.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:51.541
I see.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:54.002
Then why were you hit by Ms. Ki Ka-young?

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:57.213
Fail to consider protocol
when convincing her?

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.554
The fact that you know
means Iblis already knows too.

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:07.307
Of course.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.143
I hear the talk of the day,
and Sade hears the night's.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.107
Why are you hogging them both?

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.650
This is a fight against myself.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.653
Why is an adult doing this
in broad daylight?

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:21.904
Are you a bum?

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.364
No, I'm a respectable genie.

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:26.075
And I'm immortal,
so I'm practically an infant.

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:28.703
So I'm older than you?

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.372
Hey, infant. Move over.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.833
No wonder Ka-young doesn't like you.

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:39.672
What did you just say?

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.883
Sorry for calling you an infant.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.302
Ki Ka-young doesn't like me?

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.930
If anyone should dislike anyone, it's me.
Did she tell you that?

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:51.100
Please tell me everything you know,
Mr. Sang-hyeok.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:52.435
Master.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.982
Ejllael personally went
to the lump of clay's house? Why?

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.692
I hear he was being all enchanting,

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:02.362
saying, "Won't you come with me
to the moment you died?"

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:03.529
The moment she died?

00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:09.160
That won't be good for me.

00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:10.078
And?

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:14.123
When he said that, Master's master
told Ejllael to "piss off" and then just

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.291
went for it.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.544
She doesn't give me dinner
if she's in a mood.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:20.922
I should go check.

00:06:22.423 --> 00:06:23.257
Distract the man.

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:25.676
The man?

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:27.595
Ki Ka-young!

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.600
Wait, this is my carpet.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.478
Gosh, how could she use it to…

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:42.068
You're wearing Versac…

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:46.364
You're doing this while wearing that?

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:48.116
Ki Ka-young will be mad.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.078
The only way to train my eye for fashion
is to wear stuff like this every day.

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.872
Right, I made hamburger steaks.

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.333
Leave some for Ka-young.
She'll be home late.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.710
Where did she go? She wasn't at the auto…

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:03.339
Right.

00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:06.259
Today's the fourth.

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:27.905
Aren't you curious

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.116
about what happened?

00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:54.348
You really are doing

00:07:54.932 --> 00:07:56.809
your utmost to die, aren't you?

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.269
It's not fair.

00:07:58.352 --> 00:08:01.564
What exactly was his purpose
in making you and me meet?

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:06.486
Well, based on your actions,
it couldn't have been to make me happy.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:11.324
I don't know his intentions,
but if you do die, it'll be at my hands.

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:15.119
If you'd like,
we can say that's the reason we met.

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:48.402
Yoo Jeong-hwa hasn't attended class
for over a month.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.795
Which room is this?

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:08.422
Spare me the bullshit about privacy
and hand me the key,

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:09.715
or I'll call the police.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:13.469
She's my daughter,
and the boy she's with is a minor.

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:20.393
So fucking annoying.

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:22.770
They're fucking terrible. Fucking idiots.

00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:24.397
Pull your weight, damn it.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.524
You suck ass too.

00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:28.734
I'm doing perfectly well right now.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.572
How long do other people

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:34.949
keep theirs before making it?

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.660
The third wish, I mean.

00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:44.292
The longest was a guy
who held on to it for 72 years.

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:46.127
Wow.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.921
I get it though.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.842
Caught between the despair
that there's only one left

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:57.179
and the euphoria of knowing
that you still have one,

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.348
you don't want to break the spell.

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:03.728
Tell me.

00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:05.605
What did he wish for?

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:08.608
Most humans make
their first wish right away,

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:11.736
afraid that their newfound luck
may vanish.

00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:14.155
Then they use their second wish,

00:10:14.238 --> 00:10:17.325
patching up the first one
they rushed to make,

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.828
cursing themselves
for their failure to wish for more.

00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:24.832
And then, they live in hell,
clinging to their final wish.

00:10:24.915 --> 00:10:28.294
Seeking something greater,
greater, and greater still.

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.131
He made his final wish after 72 years.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.301
He wished for me to forget
that he'd already

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.303
made two wishes.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.725
He found the greatest thing of all.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:48.939
Does that work?

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:52.985
What do you think?

00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:56.697
If you'd like to know, try it.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:19.220
Goodness me.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:24.266
Always put the purse back in its dust bag.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.685
Do not wear on rainy days.

00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:28.187
Never ever wear
hot pink Crocs with this outfit.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.148
This outfit goes with
both sneakers and heels.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.984
Keep the shoes simple for a smart look.
And carry this purse.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:35.653
No fruit knives in the purses.

00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:37.196
My goodness, this girl.

00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:40.241
I see. So this is how you style them.

00:11:40.324 --> 00:11:42.743
Let's see.

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:49.667
Today, I choose you.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:14.525
4,000 won?

00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:16.026
For one of these?

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:19.238
Goodness me,
4,000 won gets you a loaf of bread.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:24.118
You're wearing designer heels
and a blouse from the latest collection,

00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:25.369
yet this is expensive?

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.166
You sure are strange.

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:34.128
That I am. Very strange.

00:12:35.045 --> 00:12:37.673
Come by my place sometime.
I'll fry you sweet pancakes.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:38.966
As big as your face.

00:12:41.218 --> 00:12:42.261
Just eat one.

00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:46.015
The owner here is one of my patients,
and they still need a few more implants.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.685
Then we'd best boost their sales.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.854
Especially if they're
Dr. Choi's patients, no?

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.190
All right, let's see.

00:12:58.861 --> 00:12:59.904
Too sweet.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.239
Two would be pushing it.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.658
An old-fashioned palate

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:07.244
and an ultra-smooth home invite.

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:10.998
What on earth is this lady's deal?

00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:16.629
My deal?

00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:20.007
I'm a woman
whose life was a teeny bit difficult

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.718
but has recently become
a teeny bit more fun.

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:28.307
Go on. Try it.

00:13:32.102 --> 00:13:33.938
Something's definitely off.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:38.275
Pan-geum may be having
the time of her life in Hawaii,

00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:41.028
but there's no way
she wouldn't be in touch for this long.

00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:43.823
Some crazy crap is going down.
I just know it.

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:44.865
Right?

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:49.245
It's one thing not to call us,
but she could at least answer our calls.

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:54.208
And it's odd that the moment she left,
a total stranger moved in.

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:59.296
Just now, I saw that young woman
giggling away over cookies with Dr. Choi.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.800
The other night,
I actually saw that girl and Ka-young

00:14:02.883 --> 00:14:05.219
digging up Pan-geum's chili field.

00:14:05.302 --> 00:14:07.179
I wonder what that was about.

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.682
The chili field? Goodness gracious.

00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:12.810
Ka-young finally went and did it.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:16.230
What if she killed her grandma
and buried her?

00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:18.357
- There's no way.
- Come on, Heung-rye.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.027
What do you mean there's no way?
The young bitch must be her accomplice!

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:23.988
What are you waiting for? Call Chang-sik!

00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:29.869
She's a guest at our house
for a six-month countryside stay.

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:30.911
Cut the crap.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:35.082
If she's only staying for six months,
why'd she come out of Pan-geum's room?

00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:37.459
Now, now. Calm down, everyone.

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:41.213
Our village elders have reasonable
suspicions given the circumstances,

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.007
so you'd best answer honestly.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:46.427
So, where has your grandma gone?

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.681
Hawaii. She said it was her dream
when she was young.

00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:54.059
She couldn't pick Miss Korea or Hawaii
and regretted missing both.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.519
Hawaii?

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.022
"You go to Hawaii." That Hawaii?

00:14:58.105 --> 00:14:59.481
All by her merry self?

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.151
Why are you still going on about old news?

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:04.028
- She went to Hawaii.
- Yes?

00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:06.447
But she's not answering her damn phone!

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:08.574
She went quietly by herself.

00:15:08.657 --> 00:15:11.452
See? She just said "she went"!

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.203
I told you she killed her!

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.539
And this outsider's your accomplice?

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:18.334
Goodness, dearie.
How could you say something so horrific?

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.293
Dearie?

00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:29.303
Don't you all call each other that
out in the countryside?

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.472
That's what they do on TV.

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:35.017
Look at how this minx
is squinting her eyes like this.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.185
Look at her.

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:38.479
Who do you think you're fooling?

00:15:38.562 --> 00:15:42.483
You call your grandma right now.
I want to see her with my own eyes!

00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:46.904
She's right. Aren't you even worried?
None of us can get hold of her.

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:50.199
What did I tell you? She can't call her.

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:53.661
Just spit it out. You did away
with your grandma, didn't you?

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:54.662
What kind of--

00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:56.872
You can't.

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:01.251
Hey.

00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:03.712
It's ringing right now.

00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:06.256
It'll ring, but she won't answer.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.967
MS. OH PAN-GEUM
CONNECTING

00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:13.430
Yes, hello? What is it?

00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:17.476
Has something happened?
I'm here in Hawaii.

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:20.646
Right, so you're doing fine.
It's me, Chang-sik.

00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:21.939
Say hello, everyone.

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:26.694
Is it night over there?
Gosh, that's so cool.

00:16:27.277 --> 00:16:30.406
Just look at the ocean over there.
Amazing, isn't it?

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:32.324
- Hand it over!
- It's a video call!

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:33.283
It's a vid--

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.868
You sure are something.

00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:38.497
How could you go all by yourself?
I heard you had a spare ticket and all!

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.999
Hand it here. Let's all see.

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:43.085
Hey, look at you!
A flower wearing flowers!

00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:46.296
Goodness, you're all pretty and glowing.

00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:50.634
Pan-geum, why didn't you answer our calls?
And when are you coming back?

00:16:51.885 --> 00:16:54.263
I was thinking of staying
for a few more months.

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:56.306
Ka-young is all grown up now,

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.309
and my eldest daughter asked me
to come and live with her.

00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:01.395
And… Hello?

00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:03.355
Hello?

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:06.191
- What's wrong with the connection?
- The reception here is…

00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:08.444
- Hello?
- Right, on your way back, I'd love…

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.487
Some jojoba oil, but the line cut out.

00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:12.865
Either way, you all saw that, right?

00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:15.409
We all suspected Ms. Ki for nothing!

00:17:15.492 --> 00:17:17.703
At ease. Everyone, disperse!

00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:20.330
Honestly. Let's go pick some strawberries!

00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:24.126
Why didn't you call her
when we first asked?

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.755
You kept talking in circles,
like you were hiding something.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:29.048
Of course I'd suspect you!

00:17:29.673 --> 00:17:30.883
You're not exactly normal.

00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:46.440
I thought I'd drop by the village hall,

00:17:47.524 --> 00:17:48.942
but I'll lie low from now on.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.155
I caused you such a headache.

00:18:06.376 --> 00:18:10.089
Didn't you say you'd come up with
perfectly flawless wishes?

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:12.925
You're grateful as hell?

00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:15.219
So it's moments like these.

00:18:16.136 --> 00:18:17.554
This is what I get…

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:21.475
for being selfish
and making wishes to Satan.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.916
Hello.

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:50.087
I'm a student studying
how to decipher facial features.

00:18:50.754 --> 00:18:52.840
I see you have such a pure soul.

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.219
Of course. I would.

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:58.512
I'm a spirit.

00:18:58.595 --> 00:19:00.013
But life's giving you trouble?

00:19:01.431 --> 00:19:02.474
How did you…

00:19:04.184 --> 00:19:07.104
I ought to take pleasure
in my enemy's misfortune, but I don't.

00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:11.400
- Why might that be?
- Right. Of course you're unhappy.

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:13.569
I see an ancestor of yours
died on the road.

00:19:15.028 --> 00:19:18.699
My ancestor lives on, immortal.
It's my brothers who died far from home.

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:22.369
Almost all of them died
in the war against the angels.

00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:26.456
I'm just setting the record straight.

00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:30.294
Is that so?

00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.588
Well, best wishes to you.

00:19:34.047 --> 00:19:36.675
Where are you going?
That was just the prologue.

00:19:37.217 --> 00:19:39.219
The war lasted 300 years!

00:19:47.394 --> 00:19:48.562
Heading home from work?

00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:52.149
Ms. Lee?

00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:55.694
I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:57.571
I'm deaf,

00:19:57.654 --> 00:19:59.323
so my responses are delayed.

00:19:59.406 --> 00:20:00.991
I need to read your lips.

00:20:01.074 --> 00:20:02.784
Here's your latte.

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:03.827
I had no idea.

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:05.704
Your latte's ready.

00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:13.795
I've had a lot of time to practice
because I was born this way.

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:17.007
Because one shouldn't hear
the secrets of heaven.

00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:18.508
Excuse me.

00:20:21.136 --> 00:20:22.137
What was that?

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.642
Sounded like the line, "Lucifer has come
to the school for Satans."

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:30.812
I was born
from a single breath of white smoke,

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:34.775
drawn from a hookah pipe and exhaled
by my master, the angel Ejllael.

00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:37.486
When my master made me,
he blocked my ears.

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:41.615
- Lest I trill the secrets of heaven.
- Hey, stop! You've been so nice to me!

00:20:41.698 --> 00:20:42.908
Don't get bored with me!

00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:44.993
Hey, that's the road!

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:47.621
Oh dear.

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:54.670
All right, you're free to enter now!

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.278
I don't think I've seen you here before.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.113
Auntie!

00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:23.782
I told you, that's not the bathroom!
Go outside!

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:25.659
So you must all be family.

00:21:25.742 --> 00:21:28.120
What do you say?
Do you want in on a round?

00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:29.997
But I don't know what that is.

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:31.873
And, most importantly,

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:33.500
I'm broke.

00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:36.086
Don't you worry about that.

00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:38.213
You'll learn the rules as you play,

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:40.299
and I can lend you some money.

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:43.427
Let's start with a million
with 10% deducted as interest.

00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:47.556
Wait, you're just handing me
something so precious?

00:21:48.932 --> 00:21:49.766
Thanks.

00:21:51.518 --> 00:21:53.520
You must be the leader of this tribe.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.566
Don't get nervous.
I'll approach you slowly.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.742
You've dodged the molestation charges.

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:10.495
So people over there really do
greet each other by touching noses.

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:14.333
You may leave once your guardian arrives.

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:16.251
My guardian?

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:18.837
Wait, can't I just go?

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.006
You saw me get beaten up
last time, didn't you?

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:29.264
Molestation?

00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:31.850
First you dine and dash. Now molestation?

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.394
Wear the clip.

00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:36.730
Wear it!

00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:39.608
The thing is,

00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:41.777
this all came about because…

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.112
Seriously, this is so unfair.

00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:47.574
Get over here.

00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:51.161
Unfair? This is unfair?

00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:54.623
Come here.

00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:01.671
Get over here.

00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:10.180
Two.

00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:13.475
I have two left.

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:16.728
Two.

00:23:17.312 --> 00:23:19.981
Two.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.987

CHEONGPUNGHO BANK

The psycho's filthy rich, but her
daily transfer limit is ten million!

00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:45.173
That won't do.

00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:47.843
If we move it all at once,
they'd investigate immediately.

00:23:48.468 --> 00:23:50.137
I'll figure out the rest myself.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.346
Here's my second wish.

00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:54.266
Increase Ki Ka-young's transfer limit
to the maximum.

00:24:08.905 --> 00:24:11.074
Why would you lock the break room door?

00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:13.368
Get out here.
Ki Ka-young is asking for you.

00:24:24.337 --> 00:24:27.174
I want to increase my transfer limit
to the maximum.

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:31.970
Sure.

00:24:33.221 --> 00:24:34.556
The maximum is 50 million.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.395
Fill out the blanks here and here.

00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:42.147

and hated losing it most.

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:26.900
Don't you?

00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:30.779
Didn't you see me write fast
because I hate it?

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:35.450
But if it's to validate humanity,
losing money would be worthwhile.

00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:37.786
It would prove my arrogance.

00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:43.875
So stop gloating. I know I'm losing.

00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:49.381
Why were you in the water?

00:25:50.423 --> 00:25:52.342
Those bubbles were you, right?

00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:54.928
I'll go wherever I want.

00:25:56.763 --> 00:25:58.890
It's not like you own the ocean.

00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:04.771
Is there anything you hate in particular?

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.523
Like garlic?

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.525
Or a stake?

00:26:08.608 --> 00:26:09.651
Or a cross?

00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:15.657
I particularly hate you.

00:26:16.658 --> 00:26:17.867
Get out.

00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:32.090
Hey, Mi-ju. You found your way here.

00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:36.386
I'm here, yes, but I'm not sure
a rookie like me could do anything.

00:26:36.469 --> 00:26:38.763
I was a complete mess
when I first started.

00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:41.057
Played any other sports in the past?

00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:42.892
I did a little yoga in the past.

00:26:42.976 --> 00:26:45.854
I could get my foot up to my neck
and was pretty flexible.

00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:48.356
But I can't go there anymore.

00:26:48.898 --> 00:26:50.358
I've been thinking,

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:53.445
I may as well learn something
I could use to protect someone.

00:26:54.487 --> 00:26:56.156
Hit this. Show me what you've got.

00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.784
- Holy smokes!
- Hey, what was that?

00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:03.038
You'll get us in big trouble!

00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:05.165
Mi-ju, are you loaded?

00:27:05.248 --> 00:27:06.916
I think you might have to replace this.

00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:10.462
Really? Did they attach it with glue?

00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:11.755
I'm joking, of course.

00:27:13.673 --> 00:27:14.591
Joking?

00:27:16.176 --> 00:27:18.178
Bring it on. Get over here.

00:27:22.557 --> 00:27:23.933
About that mansion.

00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:26.978
Do you think everyone
in the front yard was family?

00:27:27.062 --> 00:27:29.773
Didn't they look
more like guards than family?

00:27:30.857 --> 00:27:32.651
No. You can't fool these eyes.

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:35.570
They're not family or guards.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.532
Something is happening
in this peaceful village of mine.

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:41.159
They were…

00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:44.371
an army.

00:27:44.454 --> 00:27:45.580
- An army?
- An army?

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:47.123
Yes. Military.

00:27:47.749 --> 00:27:50.377
GOBLIN STATIONERY

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:03.723
Mister, where did you get that money?

00:28:04.307 --> 00:28:06.559
You've always been broke.

00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:07.477
Stop right there!

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.812
Why?

00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:11.147
Empty your pockets.

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:12.691
Why?

00:28:25.328 --> 00:28:27.247
Certain dark channels were involved.

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:32.001
All right. It's on me today.

00:28:32.585 --> 00:28:34.921
Really? You're being serious, right?

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:46.307
- What's with your arms?
- Certain dark family matters are involved.

00:28:48.017 --> 00:28:50.645
By the way, do you want to know a secret?

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:54.357
You have to keep this secret.

00:28:54.858 --> 00:28:56.401
Sang-hyeok, run. Quickly!

00:28:56.484 --> 00:28:57.986
Get back here, you little shit!

00:28:58.069 --> 00:29:00.280
Why take it out on him
when you're short on cash?

00:29:00.363 --> 00:29:02.866
That's why I said
get an overdraft account, you bitch!

00:29:02.949 --> 00:29:05.702
I can't with my credit score,
you fucking asshole!

00:29:06.286 --> 00:29:08.204
I saw an angel.

00:29:10.623 --> 00:29:11.750
You did?

00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:14.294
I see them occasionally too.
Okay, I'm starting.

00:29:14.377 --> 00:29:16.129
I'm being serious.

00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:17.797
So I prayed.

00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:20.175
I asked them to make
my mom's boyfriend disappear.

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:23.845
That jerk you saw doesn't grant wishes.
You have no idea how selfish he is.

00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:25.138
Don't believe me, then.

00:29:25.722 --> 00:29:28.099
Seriously, though,
as soon as I'm a bit bigger,

00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:30.101
I'd probably be able to beat him up.

00:29:30.685 --> 00:29:33.188
But it just takes too long to grow up.

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:41.321
Okay, give me 100 won.

00:29:41.404 --> 00:29:43.114
But you have a lot of money now.

00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:47.160
I'm saying I'll grant that wish for you.
But nothing in this world is free.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:51.164
You wouldn't know, but the true
wish specialist is… Woo-hoo! I won!

00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:55.043
I'll trust you this once.

00:29:55.543 --> 00:29:57.504
I deliberately lost
a 100-won match to you.

00:29:58.213 --> 00:29:59.923
What? Wow.

00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:02.425
You're worse than Satan.

00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:05.136
All right.
It's just until you become an adult.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.846
You're 12 years old right now,

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:11.518
so I'll have them maul him just enough
to keep him bedridden for 7.5 years.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.364
My arms. My legs.

00:30:26.699 --> 00:30:28.576
I know this face.

00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:31.913
Who are you?

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:34.749
Send help! A man's dying out here!

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:37.168
A man?

00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:40.129
I don't see a man here.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.007
You beat a 12-year-old
and call yourself a man?

00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:44.759
Even Satan would shed tears…

00:30:46.135 --> 00:30:47.303
Good job holding back.

00:30:49.597 --> 00:30:50.807
In BC,

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.935
I fought for three centuries
to protect my brothers.

00:30:54.894 --> 00:30:57.188
Today, in 2024 AD,

00:30:58.523 --> 00:31:00.984
I start yet another war
for the sake of a brother.

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:06.823
Sang-hyeok is an enemy,
but he's also a comrade.

00:31:07.615 --> 00:31:09.200
And he chose to become my friend.

00:31:11.035 --> 00:31:13.288
That is the reason
for your current suffering.

00:31:20.503 --> 00:31:22.130
Help me!

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:25.717
Help me! I was wrong. Please!

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.051
How unlucky.

00:31:27.135 --> 00:31:28.136
Help me!

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:30.722
My specialty is killing, not saving.

00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:09.052
Why do you keep following me?
Got nothing better to do?

00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:12.305
I had to get him
from the desert back to Korea,

00:32:12.388 --> 00:32:14.599
call an ambulance,
and frame him as delusional!

00:32:14.682 --> 00:32:16.601
Why stir up chaos in the modern world?

00:32:16.684 --> 00:32:19.103
Why are you suddenly pretending
to be a good guy?

00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:22.190
You know, I've been thinking about that.

00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:25.485
Ever think I was originally the good guy,
and you were the bad one?

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.823
I shall use a very blunt scythe
when I slit your throat.

00:32:30.907 --> 00:32:32.033
So one strike won't do.

00:32:32.116 --> 00:32:33.201
See?

00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:35.495
You and I are no different.

00:32:36.496 --> 00:32:39.582
Do you even have time for this?
Don't you need to go see Ki Ka-young?

00:32:41.209 --> 00:32:43.628
I guess you're not up for another beating.

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.130
What?

00:32:47.423 --> 00:32:49.008
Concerned I'll go see her again?

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.638
What did you even mean to show her?

00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:55.098
What, my cruelty?

00:32:55.682 --> 00:32:56.975
Or the wishes she made?

00:32:57.058 --> 00:32:59.727
That's why I was punished
for 983 years, no less.

00:33:01.187 --> 00:33:02.480
Isn't that enough?

00:33:07.402 --> 00:33:08.820
How laughable.

00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:12.115
We have lived an eternity,

00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:14.575
so that period of less than 1,000 years

00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:17.495
was hardly punishment.

00:33:22.959 --> 00:33:26.629
I've inspected every element,
and there are no issues with the watch.

00:33:26.713 --> 00:33:27.547
Really?

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.927
I'm sure the watch hands spun backwards.

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:34.846
Incredibly fast at that.

00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:39.600
I've been working here for over ten years,
and I've never had an inquiry like this.

00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:42.228
Moreover, it's just impossible, ma'am.

00:33:55.283 --> 00:33:56.993
So I really can't let myself in?

00:34:05.168 --> 00:34:06.461
What the hell does it say?

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:08.171
It says you shouldn't shake it.

00:34:08.254 --> 00:34:10.923
That an ill-tempered genie
might get angry.

00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:19.307
TRANSLATE

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:24.187
SHELF LIFE IS INFINITE
FROM DATE OF REMAKING: OCTOBER 24, 1061

00:34:25.521 --> 00:34:26.689
So he lied.

00:34:27.356 --> 00:34:28.775
If it was the year 1061,

00:34:28.858 --> 00:34:31.778
and he said he was confined for 983 years,

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.946
he's 20 years short.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:38.576
It couldn't have been a housing scam.

00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:40.828
What is this?

00:35:09.065 --> 00:35:10.066
Who are they?

00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:13.027
What have they been doing there all day?

00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:15.530
Should we bring it up?

00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:22.703
Why the intense stares?

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.872
What are they looking at all day?

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.294
I'm Chauffeur Kim, a former member
of the Reconnaissance Unit.

00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:32.839
I sense some intense eyes on us.

00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:35.007
Two in the bushes.

00:35:36.425 --> 00:35:37.677
Two more in the mansion.

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:39.971
Perhaps more.

00:35:42.431 --> 00:35:43.349
Boss,

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:46.477
what kind of life have you led?

00:35:48.896 --> 00:35:50.314
I have no other choice.

00:35:51.607 --> 00:35:53.734
You can trust me, sir.

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:02.326
Apologies, sir,

00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:05.371
but may I ask what you are waiting for?

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:07.832
I'm waiting

00:36:08.749 --> 00:36:09.750
for my dad.

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:12.503
This is where I lost my way.

00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:16.674
I remember the smell of my dad's car.

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:22.263
My younger brother, Ha-neul. Kim Ha-neul.

00:36:23.472 --> 00:36:24.807
He'll be looking for me.

00:36:27.435 --> 00:36:28.352
Dad?

00:36:28.436 --> 00:36:31.147
Is this short-term memory loss
or something?

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:35.276
What on earth
have you gotten tangled up in, sir?

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:38.821
- That's insane.
- She sure is something.

00:36:38.905 --> 00:36:42.325
Can you believe he told me
I can't leave work until she gets here?

00:36:42.909 --> 00:36:44.660
I swear the guy's nuts.

00:36:44.744 --> 00:36:45.578
This is crazy.

00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:47.079
She's here.

00:36:47.663 --> 00:36:49.207
Is something wrong?

00:36:50.958 --> 00:36:52.543
I honestly can't believe this.

00:36:52.627 --> 00:36:53.628
Come with me.

00:36:58.174 --> 00:36:59.634
What the hell is going on here?

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:02.094
Why is the money
in Ms. Ki Ka-young's account

00:37:02.178 --> 00:37:05.681
being transferred into your account
every day, Ms. Gu?

00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:07.058
Are you embezzling?

00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:11.145
How could you say such a thing?
It's the first I'm hearing of it too.

00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:15.524
For the past two weeks,
there have been transfers of ten million,

00:37:15.608 --> 00:37:18.110
then 50 million won every day,
and this is news to you?

00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:19.737
This is so damn unfair!

00:37:20.238 --> 00:37:23.032
Are you saying I should spend
all my time checking my account?

00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:25.952
Huge amounts
were being transferred every day,

00:37:26.035 --> 00:37:27.411
and you seriously didn't know?

00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:30.539
Our logs show you repeatedly accessed
Ms. Ki Ka-young's information.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.667
How do you explain that?

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.835
You asked me to sell her our pension plan.

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:37.964
That's why I looked.
To figure out how to convince her!

00:37:38.047 --> 00:37:40.091
You saw the logs, so you'll know.

00:37:40.174 --> 00:37:42.260
She came in
to increase her transfer limit.

00:37:42.343 --> 00:37:43.970
So why are you doing this to me?

00:37:44.053 --> 00:37:47.598
Shouldn't you be speaking
to Ki Ka-young about this, not me?

00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:48.891
Why, you…

00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:50.601
Given the situation, sir,

00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:53.688
the Financial Supervisory Service
must already be investigating--

00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:54.897
Shut your mouth!

00:37:55.481 --> 00:37:56.524
Of course I know that!

00:37:57.024 --> 00:37:57.858
Unbelievable.

00:37:58.359 --> 00:38:01.862
Ms. Gu, go meet Ms. Ki Ka-young
before the FSS does,

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:03.948
and find out what has happened here.

00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:05.908
You're friends, aren't you? Friends!

00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:08.995
All of our jobs are on the line now.

00:38:10.496 --> 00:38:11.372
Yes, sir.

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:22.341
I'm back.

00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:24.802
Eat up.

00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:33.060
Thanks for the book.

00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:45.406
HISTORY OF GORYEO

00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:56.417
Have you

00:38:57.835 --> 00:38:59.253
finally made a decision?

00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:08.888
The angels came down
and began slaughtering all genies,

00:39:09.388 --> 00:39:11.682
and Ejllael is the one who led the charge.

00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:16.562
The war lasted 300 years,

00:39:17.563 --> 00:39:19.523
and I lost most of my brothers
as a result.

00:39:24.653 --> 00:39:25.821
Lead the way

00:39:26.405 --> 00:39:27.740
to the moment I died.

00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:39.794
He is displeased

00:39:40.586 --> 00:39:44.215
as disasters and droughts
have struck Ifriqiya,

00:39:45.174 --> 00:39:46.967
costing countless human lives.

00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:49.678
You'd best not provoke them.

00:39:50.179 --> 00:39:52.306
Don't overdo it.

00:39:53.307 --> 00:39:57.144
Anyway, what is that face you wear?

00:39:57.728 --> 00:40:01.816
I chose a face set to be in high demand
across the world for the next millennium.

00:40:03.192 --> 00:40:05.069
I'm speaking in their language now too.

00:40:06.112 --> 00:40:08.531
My next wish-maker
is on their way from there.

00:40:45.192 --> 00:40:47.319
Dogs! Wild hounds!

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.155
Run!

00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:54.243
A pack of wild hounds!

00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:03.127
Dogs! It's a pack of wild hounds!

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:06.130
Just throw that limping boy aside!

00:41:07.882 --> 00:41:09.008
No, don't!

00:41:09.091 --> 00:41:11.093
You can't!

00:41:11.719 --> 00:41:13.053
Don't!

00:41:16.265 --> 00:41:17.308
Hunbish!

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.210
The time has come for some wishes.

00:42:04.313 --> 00:42:07.107
It's Iblis! It's Shaytan!

00:42:07.608 --> 00:42:10.611
It's Shaytan! Run!

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:13.614
Where are you going?
Cast the Goryeo bitch aside too!

00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:16.617
Run away!

00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:21.372
Save me!

00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.544
Hurry, run!

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.099
I am Genie, the lamp spirit.

00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:42.560
I shall grant you three wishes.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:44.228
Make them.

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:47.982
Did you say wishes?

00:42:49.024 --> 00:42:51.777
No bringing back the dead.
No traveling to the future.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.404
Anything besides that,

00:42:53.487 --> 00:42:54.863
your wish…

00:42:58.242 --> 00:42:59.493
is my command.

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:02.955
Are you also

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.291
from Goryeo, sir?

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.212
If you'd like it that way,
let's say it's so.

00:43:10.296 --> 00:43:11.130
Now,

00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:13.549
make your first wish.

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:20.222
Please save Hunbish.

00:43:21.056 --> 00:43:23.684
Please let him live a long, long life.

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:27.479
Please! He can't just die like this.

00:43:28.522 --> 00:43:29.565
That's right.

00:43:33.027 --> 00:43:33.986
Come with me

00:43:35.321 --> 00:43:36.280
to corruption.

00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:05.517
Run!

00:44:07.353 --> 00:44:09.104
Do not blame me.

00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:13.901
My young master wishes
for someone to live a long life.

00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:23.619
And for a long, lengthy life,

00:44:25.204 --> 00:44:26.705
a blood sacrifice must be made.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:31.293
Desert,

00:44:32.127 --> 00:44:33.754
be tainted by this blood.

00:44:36.965 --> 00:44:38.759
The boy lives,

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.303
though the wild hounds will starve.

00:44:58.237 --> 00:45:00.739
Now, shall we hear
what your second wish is?

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:06.370
Please make it so that

00:45:07.955 --> 00:45:09.456
other children from Goryeo

00:45:10.332 --> 00:45:13.085
aren't sold to be animal feed, as I was.

00:45:16.296 --> 00:45:17.881
Then I shall cut off the path.

00:45:19.925 --> 00:45:21.176
I shall be back soon.

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:41.655
This is probably around 1041 AD.

00:45:43.115 --> 00:45:45.492
Are you sure it was the year 1041?

00:45:46.368 --> 00:45:47.286
I'm sure.

00:45:48.036 --> 00:45:51.498
I remember it as the time when Iblis
was at his height, deceiving humans.

00:45:52.875 --> 00:45:55.919
There was an unusually large number
of deaths that year.

00:45:57.045 --> 00:45:57.880
Including yours.

00:46:02.468 --> 00:46:05.012
You see them, don't you? All those deaths.

00:46:07.097 --> 00:46:08.766
All the work of Iblis.

00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:36.877
There they are.

00:46:37.503 --> 00:46:39.338
Do you see me there with a scythe?

00:46:41.006 --> 00:46:43.967
I haven't seen my original face
in a long time.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.054
I'll change it to this face
so it's less jarring.

00:46:53.936 --> 00:46:56.647
So your second wish
has also been fulfilled.

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:59.566
The path to Goryeo has been blocked.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.860
Blocking that path
triggered quakes and tsunamis.

00:47:03.028 --> 00:47:05.989
With your first wish,
15 of 17 merchants lost their lives,

00:47:06.073 --> 00:47:09.535
and due to your second wish,
hundreds of humans died.

00:47:13.372 --> 00:47:14.540
That can't be.

00:47:14.623 --> 00:47:16.834
I didn't make such wishes.

00:47:18.794 --> 00:47:19.711
Please help!

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:24.716
I guess that makes it 16.

00:47:34.643 --> 00:47:37.104
Now, only your final wish remains.

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:39.773
Girl from a foreign land, make your wish.

00:47:42.651 --> 00:47:46.488
This is not what I wanted.

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:49.616
What do I do now?

00:47:50.158 --> 00:47:53.203
I made the wrong kinds of wishes.

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:56.290
How foolish.

00:47:57.499 --> 00:47:59.793
There's no such thing as the right wish.

00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:02.963
To gain something,
something else must be lost.

00:48:03.463 --> 00:48:06.133
For someone to live, another must die.

00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:08.135
Sade!

00:48:34.494 --> 00:48:37.789
You may say such things, but your
final wish will be "please save me."

00:48:39.124 --> 00:48:39.958
So make your wish.

00:48:48.342 --> 00:48:49.384
No.

00:48:51.136 --> 00:48:52.554
I accept

00:48:53.847 --> 00:48:55.140
whatever punishment.

00:48:56.475 --> 00:48:57.976
So please,

00:48:58.602 --> 00:48:59.770
make sure…

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:04.149
we are punished.

00:49:05.233 --> 00:49:08.111
You and I both.

00:49:11.406 --> 00:49:12.366
What?

00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:14.826
It's only fair.

00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:17.079
This

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.290
is my final wish.

00:49:31.051 --> 00:49:32.469
You lowly thing. You dare…

00:49:34.763 --> 00:49:37.474
You petty human,
molded from mere clay. You dare?

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:44.648
Behold.

00:49:44.731 --> 00:49:47.526
His creations
are truly righteous and beautiful.

00:49:47.609 --> 00:49:48.944
You have lost, Iblis.

00:49:49.945 --> 00:49:51.571
You remember his words, don't you?

00:49:52.072 --> 00:49:54.866
If you happen to meet
even one pure human, you will forever…

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:56.284
- Just wait.
- No, forever!

00:49:56.368 --> 00:49:57.953
Wait, just wait!

00:50:01.123 --> 00:50:02.374
Righteous?

00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:05.335
I'm not sure.

00:50:07.254 --> 00:50:08.171
Because really,

00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:10.465
there's room for interpretation here.

00:50:11.967 --> 00:50:14.636
So would you put in
a good word for me, Brother?

00:50:19.766 --> 00:50:20.809
Cut the crap.

00:50:28.775 --> 00:50:30.152
Is this really the end?

00:50:31.236 --> 00:50:32.070
Really?

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:34.740
Hey, come back.

00:50:35.323 --> 00:50:36.158
Ejllael.

00:50:36.783 --> 00:50:37.951
Get back down here!

00:50:47.085 --> 00:50:48.462
You lowly clay. You dare…

00:50:48.962 --> 00:50:51.256
You lowly being, molded on a Friday.

00:50:51.339 --> 00:50:53.967
Mere human who lives
for less than 100 years. You dare!

00:52:03.745 --> 00:52:04.579
Do you see?

00:52:04.663 --> 00:52:06.832
Your death was so tragic.

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:10.085
Iblis is an evil bastard

00:52:10.168 --> 00:52:12.796
who twisted every wish you made,
no matter what it was,

00:52:12.879 --> 00:52:14.172
to lead you to corruption.

00:52:30.272 --> 00:52:31.106
It wasn't…

00:52:33.108 --> 00:52:34.192
rage.

00:52:37.154 --> 00:52:39.197
When I saw him in the lamp,

00:52:39.781 --> 00:52:41.449
it definitely looked like rage.

00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:43.326
But this…

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:46.830
This face…

00:52:50.375 --> 00:52:51.668
is undeniably

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:54.004
true sorrow.

00:53:39.674 --> 00:53:40.634
How laughable.

00:53:43.178 --> 00:53:46.848
We have lived an eternity,
so that period of less than 1,000 years

00:53:46.932 --> 00:53:48.183
was hardly punishment.

00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:41.249

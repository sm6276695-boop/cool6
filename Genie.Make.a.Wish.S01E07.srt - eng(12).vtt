GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:10.612
It wasn't rage.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.406
But this…

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:18.369
This face

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.456
is undeniably…

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:24.709
true sorrow.

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:29.881
I will now also give you sorrow

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.637
I will give you sorrow
More precious than love.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:39.057
An old woman who had laid
A few tangerines on the street

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.851
Shivering from a lifetime of cold
On a winter's night

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.648
What is this anyway?
Why do I have to do this?

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.026
Just keep reciting it.

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:53.655
You'd better recite it
ten times every day, okay?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.117
Grandma hopes that my darling Ka-young,

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:00.745
that you, my dear bundle of joy,
will one day

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:04.290
cry your heart out with longing

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:07.252
and also burst out laughing with joy.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.379
That's what I want for you.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.339
Let's try it, okay?

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:15.885
To you, who rejoiced as you haggled
The price of tangerines…

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.595
DESPAIR

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.305
LONGING

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.059
…I shall show you sorrow's equal face

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:29.691
When I called out to you
From the darkness…

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:36.364
Not once did you show me an equal smile

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:40.869
When a frozen corpse
Froze yet again under a straw sack

00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:44.747
You did not so much
As cover it with another sack

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.794
For your indifferent love

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.467
For your tears
That seem incapable of flowing

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:12.775
Iblis is not the kind of being
you think he is.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.404
My brother Iblis's sole purpose is
to hoodwink humans and drag them to hell.

00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:18.573
The only thing he can give you is hell.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.118
So please just make a righteous wish--

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.286
Let me ask you.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:29.000
I will now also give you waiting

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:30.376
What were you doing?

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:32.837
You're an angel.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:36.382
While that young boy
and this young girl were dying…

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.802
just what were you doing?

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:42.096
I was praying, of course.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.266
I am his warrior first
and an angel second.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.434
Warrior?

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:48.686
I am

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:52.148
a mechanic who beats up assholes like you.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.494
Careful now.

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:06.996
Hey, you got furniture?

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:09.791
What is all this?

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.878
It just sort of happened.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.715
Are you feeling any better?
I've never felt my heart hurt before.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.300
Did you see me

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.680
crying tears of blood
before I was detained, by any chance?

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:27.308
No, you were always the one
making humans cry tears of blood.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:32.438
Then did you perhaps see me
meet a woman before I was detained?

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.940
I wouldn't know.

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:36.818
You were moving around
from one jar to the next.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.778
Are you sure it wasn't Jinniya?

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.655
It wasn't.

00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:46.286
What in the world was that?

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.038
Why did I see the lump of clay's face?

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.584
By the way, why did that start flowing?

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:54.585
What's flowing?

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:58.840
What the…

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:01.968
Why is it suddenly flowing
after 983 years of being still?

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:03.511
It wasn't flowing earlier.

00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:04.887
Why is it? What's going on?

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:06.806
Do you think it could be that?

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.309
It's my boss
who's contained here, isn't it?

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:10.685
Then the answer's clear.

00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:13.563
It's the time you have left
to corrupt her.

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:16.316
Your heart must have hurt
because this started flowing,

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.234
and you don't have much time left.

00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:20.153
Could that really be it?

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:25.867
Was I getting an early taste of death?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.536
How much time do I have left?

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:31.039
Is this handful of sand

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.291
all the time I have left?

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.629
Iblis was in pain?

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.923
Yes, according to
the magpies' testimonies.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.885
They say that everything
within his reach turned to ash.

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.511
A pile of ash? It was that bad?

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.097
Damn, why is that?

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:52.393
Is it because I took Ki Ka-young
to see her past life?

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.311
Pardon?

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:56.230
Given the timing, that seems likely.

00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:58.775
Why did you show Ki Ka-young
her past life?

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:03.571
I hoped Ki Ka-young, enraged by her death,
would seek revenge with a righteous wish.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:05.406
But it was pointless.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.033
That woman.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.912
She saw the truth.

00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:13.456
Not about her death,

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.458
but how Iblis mourned it.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:18.419
That was an important contract…

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.548
And she even clocked
the 20-year difference?

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:24.550
Thankfully she doesn't know that much.

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:27.678
But I think it's true
that pressuring her backfired.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:30.473
Ki Ka-young's lifespan changed.

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.188
Her lifespan?

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.860
I will put an end to the heavy snow
That once fell on this world

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.532
I will take the spring snow
That fell on the barley fields

00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:53.996
And visit the sorrows of the people
Shivering with cold

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:58.543
I will walk the snowy paths with you
Where it no longer snows

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:13.099
It was getting late.

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:16.227
I was visiting somewhere.

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.023
We will talk of the power of sorrow

00:07:22.483 --> 00:07:25.820
And walk all the way
To the sorrow of waiting

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:42.003
You're not answering my calls.
Are you busy? It's me, Gu Bo-gyeong.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.255
Let's see you squirm.

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:52.638
This is probably around 1041 AD.

00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:56.309
There's still that 20-year difference.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.366
Damn it.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.035
You're still here doing this?

00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:16.454
I knew this would happen.

00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:20.374
My boss isn't just anyone. At this rate,
she'll make a righteous last wish.

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.584
Smoothly and silently.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.669
Master's neck? Clean off.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.255
I knew this was how things would turn out.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.134
You should have told me if you knew.

00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:32.261
Don't use that word.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.264
No more words that start with "right."
I know what I'm doing!

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.141
Really? What are you planning?

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:41.395
Humans make such a fuss
and fight over love.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:44.899
They cry, laugh, and even thrive on love,
but in the end, it wrecks them.

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:48.486
I'll brainwash them into her.
Joy, sorrow, waiting, and longing.

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:50.071
And, if possible,

00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:51.739
even love.

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:56.452
That's not exactly how that works.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.580
I shall infuse you with love,
O emotionless one.

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:02.583
But I will not let you have me,
thus bringing you despair.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:03.793
Don't hold me back.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.753
If it's for revenge,

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.589
I'll use love as a weapon.

00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:11.342
So what's your plan?

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.555
First things first,
I'll become very irresistible.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:16.597
On that note…

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.099
Don't be so ridiculous.

00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:19.725
Could you pay the Internet café?

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:23.187
GORYEO ARABIAN MERCHANTS

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:24.939
THE RAPID PROGRESS OF GORYEO SOCIETY

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:31.320
RECORDS OF ARAB MERCHANT VISITS
CEASE AFTER 1040

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.990
But the exchanges stopped
after the year 1040.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.032
I wonder why.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:36.701
Did someone block the path?

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:39.829
Your second wish has also been fulfilled.

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.956
The path to Goryeo has been blocked.

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:44.333
Blocking that path
triggered quakes and tsunamis.

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.337
So it was because of my wish?

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:04.312
Why can't you just say it? This genie
is my genie. I am this genie's master!

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:08.941
Turn off the music already.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.568
Or maybe you want to get smacked?

00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:13.279
Right? It's "maybe," right?

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:16.198
I knew it. How he said, "Baby, let's go!"

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:17.992
was just so strange.

00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:20.161
The writer must've been nuts.

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:23.831
Hey! That writer is…

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:27.418
Shut your mouth.

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:34.300
There's more? Don't tell me.
A sequined tracksuit with foam on your…

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.471
Wow, I hadn't even thought of that one.

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:43.100
Go, Ki Ka-young!

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.518
Bravo!

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:46.771
You're amazing, Ka-young!

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:56.822
I considered both options,
but I guess neither worked.

00:11:00.284 --> 00:11:01.410
Don't tell me you're…

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:02.745
CHOI YOUNG-DO

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.832
I hoped it wouldn't come to this too.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:09.752
But I have no other choice,
seeing as my life is on the line.

00:11:11.962 --> 00:11:15.383
Why are you always holding stuff
like that? Makes me want to protect you.

00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:20.846
That's oddly convincing.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.598
Fine, whatever.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.266
Take a seat over here, kid.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.060
What is this?

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:28.396
Did my brainwashing actually work?

00:11:31.565 --> 00:11:33.275
About when I died.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.361
- In my past life.
- Yeah?

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:37.697
Didn't you loathe me back then?

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.910
Why would you think I didn't?
What, can't you see my loathing now?

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:50.876
I can't.

00:11:53.462 --> 00:11:54.880
I've hidden it well, then.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.552
The expression I saw
was definitely true sorrow.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:04.014
The only people who look at me like that
are Grandma and Min-ji.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:07.643
I hear that's what they call
being cut deep.

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:10.730
So what cut you?

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:13.274
What are you talking about?
What did you see and where?

00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:16.610
Are there female genies too?

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.405
What?

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.700
What if there are? Why?

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.869
- Are there?
- Jinniya?

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.497
Of course there are.
That's what female genies are called.

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:29.915
Jinniya.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.126
Have you ever seen one?

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.213
A long time ago.

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:37.840
Did you two date?

00:12:40.217 --> 00:12:43.053
A long… time ago.

00:12:43.637 --> 00:12:44.930
It was, you know…

00:12:45.806 --> 00:12:49.268
It was before Christ,
and I was really young back then, and--

00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:52.897
Whatever. Just show me the look.
The one you gave the female genie.

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:56.442
Come on, how could I do that?

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:59.820
I wasn't even using this face back then.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.406
My facial features were all different.

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:06.786
Different, how?
Did you not have two eyes and a nose?

00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:14.502
Is the genie who controls the rain
a jinniya, by any chance?

00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:16.712
Then it must have rained every day.

00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:19.256
What?

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:22.426
Did you two kiss?

00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:26.931
I had completely different
facial features, okay?

00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:29.433
This mouth didn't even exist back then!

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.312
I'm actually late for something.

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:34.563
See you at home.

00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:37.691
So you did.

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:38.776
Get back here!

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:46.784
That woman. She saw the truth.

00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:48.118
Not about her death,

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.454
but how Iblis mourned it.

00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:59.296
It's been quite a while, Iblis.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.340
I ought to be saying that to you.

00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:03.217
It's been a while since I saw you.

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:07.596
My dear Irem, you spent
every single day for 983 years

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.475
faithfully aiding your master
in covering my lamp with more sand.

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:14.562
I assume you have a request.

00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:15.729
I do have a favor.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:19.358
Any idea where and what
Jinniya is inhabiting these days?

00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:23.112
If you don't know, could you find out?
Without her knowing, of course.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:24.029
Until then.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.291
Mark down any items
close to expiring, okay?

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:36.208
Yes, sir.

00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:41.922
Sir, when did you…

00:14:42.923 --> 00:14:45.134
I had a meeting
with a supplier this morning.

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:47.469
It's ten minutes until lunch.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.472
Manager Kang, do you think
this is some kind of brunch café?

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:53.809
Meeting? With which supplier?

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.978
It's time for lunch,
so we should eat together.

00:14:56.937 --> 00:15:00.357
If I'm honest,
something urgent came up at home.

00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:02.067
I'm so sorry.

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:03.569
I have no words.

00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:05.070
You're apologizing for this?

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:09.366
Manager Kang, you shouldn't be
apologizing for this kind of thing.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.951
Just take responsibility!

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:15.831
Your reputation and numbers are shit.
Even your work ethic is fucking shit.

00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:18.042
Director.

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:19.793
You didn't even know I was coming,

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:22.630
which means no one on your team
even bothered to warn you.

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:25.758
How did you even become
a branch manager in the first place?

00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:27.426
Did you sell your soul to the devil?

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.429
Twenty years is a lot
for a deadweight like you.

00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:34.224
Leave your resignation on your desk,
and just go. No need for a handover.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.812
I heard Cheongpung has great thistle rice.

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:39.939
Yes, sir.

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:46.445
Ms. Kang Im-seon,
are you out of your mind?

00:15:47.404 --> 00:15:48.238
Oh my gosh!

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:52.660
I'm currently submitting my resignation.
Is there a problem?

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:55.663
Since you won't be needing a handover,

00:15:56.163 --> 00:15:57.331
I'll be off now.

00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:00.125
I need to sell
the rest of my soul to the devil.

00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:17.101
Boss.

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:19.770
I'll help you find your family.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.522
I won't ask questions.

00:16:23.524 --> 00:16:27.486
Maybe we should move past the car
and try to remember something else.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:28.904
Memories?

00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:34.284
"Let's go for a walk!"

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:41.625
"That son of a bitch is so damn loud!
Just shut up already!"

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.128
The lady in unit 904 was scary.

00:16:46.046 --> 00:16:48.340
The Animal H…

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:52.511
Head? H… head.

00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:57.099
Dr. Kim. I'll bite him good.

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.352
Head?

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:01.687
Yeah.

00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:09.570
Healing, hall, habitual, hospital.

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:12.406
There's a chance he's mistaken.

00:17:12.489 --> 00:17:15.784
If Dr. Kim is an actual doctor,
their surname must be Kim.

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:18.037
I've found it.

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.372
Boss, let's go.

00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:22.791
That hospital's two hours from here.

00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:24.752
Really?

00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:34.803
Are you really sure you lived here?

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:35.971
This is the place.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.933
The way here from the hospital was right.

00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:41.643
Thank you, Chauffeur Kim.

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:48.567
It looks as though they haven't been home
for at least three days.

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:51.904
Then I need to "wait."

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.161
I smell my younger brother.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:09.546
Could it be that he has memories
of being raised like a dog?

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:11.632
That muttfucker!

00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:23.727
Maybe we picked a town
that's just too dull.

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:28.232
No stories or action.
Just one big snoozefest.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.822
What is this? A phishing scam?

00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:36.448
Click.

00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:40.994
I AM GENIE, THE LAMP SPIRIT.
I SHALL GRANT YOU…

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:42.663
What the… A genie?

00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:46.166
Man, the emojis hella suck.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.584
I SHALL GRANT THREE WISHES…

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:51.004
WHATEVER. I'LL DM YOU THE DETAILS,
SO JUST MAKE A WISH

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:53.924
Is Da-jin pulling a prank?

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:55.509
All right,

00:18:56.009 --> 00:18:57.177
I'll bite.

00:18:57.761 --> 00:18:59.054
Let's see.

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.099
Is there anything we could film
that would go viral?

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:03.267
This village

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:06.520
is just too quiet.

00:19:06.603 --> 00:19:08.897
SO WHAT? YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE A RACKET IN THE VILLAGE?

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:12.151
These small towns are bound to have
one of those, you know…

00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:14.653
Right, like some

00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:17.030
secret crime hidden in the village.

00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:24.454
"It's been fulfilled"?
What a crock of shit.

00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:26.915
Hey, it would need to beat the algorithm.

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.417
You think I'm some idiot…

00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:33.088
What the hell?

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:39.511
Where am I?

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:42.139
This is freaking me the hell out.

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:45.809
When did I switch this on?

00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:51.773
Right, hello, everyone.
Yes, I've had a few drinks.

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:54.109
What?

00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:56.528
I didn't fall over.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.405
I was just lying down…

00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:04.912
Why's there a stupid hole here?

00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:09.416
Sorry?

00:20:11.126 --> 00:20:12.461
Was there something there?

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:15.797
Well, I always do as you ask.

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.966
All right. Okay.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.594
Thanks to you guys,
I'm digging in the dead of night.

00:20:20.677 --> 00:20:22.346
What would even be here?

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:27.267
What's this?

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.938
Holy shit!

00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:33.607
END OF LIVESTREAM

00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:36.944
SWEETHEART

00:20:38.278 --> 00:20:39.363
Da-jin.

00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:40.697
Da-jin!

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:41.990
There's a corpse!

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.242
Start streaming again.

00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:45.744
Go live again, you idiot!

00:20:45.827 --> 00:20:48.163
We had over 100 live viewers!

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.081
What?

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.847
We've passed 600,000 views!

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:07.641
And who discovered this? Me.

00:21:07.724 --> 00:21:10.310
Yours truly. Me, Ko Yeong-hyeon.

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:13.063
- I discovered it, I tell you.
- Why did you even go there?

00:21:13.146 --> 00:21:15.107
- That late. In the middle of drinking.
- What?

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:20.112
I AM GENIE, THE LAMP SPIRIT

00:21:20.195 --> 00:21:21.530
IT'S BEEN FULFILLED

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.949
No way.

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:25.951
The genie?

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:28.370
I heard from Constable Oh,

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:31.540
and the corpse was fully decomposed.

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:35.335
If you can help it,
please avoid going out at night.

00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:38.005
And if you must,
make sure to travel in pairs.

00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:40.465
Goodness, this is scary as hell.

00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:43.510
What is all this chaos
in our usually quiet village?

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:45.012
Indeed.

00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:50.559
Yeah, that auto shop.

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:53.520
Just one body doesn't mean
she stopped at killing one.

00:21:53.603 --> 00:21:56.481
If she's always been a psychopath,
they should investigate her--

00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:57.649
Just a moment.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.152
It wasn't Ka-young.

00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:03.613
On what basis are you spouting
that absolute horse shit?

00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:05.198
I won't treat you. Please leave.

00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:08.243
Why are you snapping at us?
This isn't the only clinic around.

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:12.497
Which is why I'm asking you to leave
before I press charges for defamation!

00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:16.501
We didn't even say anything out of line.
Why's she shouting at her clients?

00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:17.794
I'm so put off.

00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:34.186
We need detergent.

00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:35.228
Right, that one.

00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:39.483
I wonder if Pan-geum even knows

00:22:39.566 --> 00:22:42.152
what's going on here
over in Hawaii or whatever.

00:22:42.235 --> 00:22:44.821
Do you know why Pan-geum
still hasn't come back?

00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:48.575
She's abandoned her too.
She's run away for good.

00:22:48.658 --> 00:22:50.535
Ka-young always used her grandma as cover

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:53.080
to sell us the lie
that she was just like anybody else.

00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:55.624
So yeah, we all played along.

00:22:55.707 --> 00:22:59.461
But to be completely honest,
Ka-young is the most suspicious.

00:22:59.961 --> 00:23:02.089
You can't change someone's nature.

00:23:02.589 --> 00:23:05.008
That's utter nonsense.

00:23:05.092 --> 00:23:08.136
I am a former Marine.
I'm as sharp as a tack.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.473
It takes 20 years, minimum,
for a corpse to fully decompose.

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:13.683
Twenty years ago,
Ms. Ki would have been eight.

00:23:14.643 --> 00:23:16.686
How would an eight-year-old kill a person?

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.438
Why the hell not?

00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:21.358
There must be sketchy stuff
all over that auto shop of hers.

00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:24.111
Things that could melt
human flesh right down.

00:23:24.194 --> 00:23:26.988
You've always had
a vivid imagination, Ms. Park.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.996
Grandma, what is it? Why are you crying?

00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:36.915
Who died this time?

00:23:43.213 --> 00:23:44.631
Ka-young.

00:23:44.714 --> 00:23:46.967
No matter what people say about you,

00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:50.470
even if they suspect you and such,

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:53.890
you must not harm them, okay?

00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:56.810
Why would I harm them? I didn't do it.

00:23:58.437 --> 00:23:59.771
Of course, my darling.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.482
I know that very well.

00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:06.611
I just worry others might not know
and point their fingers at you.

00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:09.322
I hate you crying more than any of that.

00:24:09.823 --> 00:24:10.657
Don't cry.

00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:15.036
All right. I won't cry.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.331
My tears have all dried up.

00:24:19.499 --> 00:24:21.460
Gosh, I'm so out of it.

00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:24.671
I got frozen pollack for spicy fish stew,
but forgot the crown daisy.

00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:27.257
I'll get some.
Don't go out unless you have to.

00:24:28.383 --> 00:24:30.635
Grandma, you stay here and make the broth.

00:24:53.366 --> 00:24:55.911
Thirty missed calls,
and you didn't think to call back?

00:24:58.371 --> 00:24:59.623
Why exactly did you call?

00:24:59.706 --> 00:25:01.333
Come explain yourself at the bank.

00:25:01.416 --> 00:25:04.419
You know, right? That your money's
being transferred to my account.

00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:06.713
My accounts were frozen because of you.

00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:08.632
This indicates tax evasion.

00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:10.842
Am I currently committing tax evasion?

00:25:12.093 --> 00:25:16.097
Don't play dumb. You gave it to me
willingly, whatever the reason!

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:17.140
That makes it a gift!

00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:20.977
So just come and tell the bank
that you gifted it to me.

00:25:22.103 --> 00:25:23.271
Or I'll report you.

00:25:25.982 --> 00:25:26.816
Report me?

00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:31.404
You committed the crime,
and you're reporting me?

00:25:34.115 --> 00:25:34.950
You're a murderer.

00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:38.286
Everyone says you're the one
behind that skeleton murder.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.915
You act like you're hot shit,
but I could just kill you.

00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:44.251
How do you think your money came to me?

00:25:44.334 --> 00:25:46.836
I made a wish to a genie, the lamp spirit.

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:50.340
It doesn't matter whether you believe me.

00:25:50.423 --> 00:25:51.508
Just deal with it.

00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:54.427
Otherwise, I'll wish to have you killed.

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:57.264
Make the wish, then. Just kill me now.

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:03.937
But if you kill me now,
my grandma will inherit all my money.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.772
You won't see a cent of it.

00:26:06.523 --> 00:26:08.024
You fucking bitch!

00:26:08.858 --> 00:26:10.235
You psychopathic bitch!

00:26:10.318 --> 00:26:12.112
You're right. I am a psychopath.

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:15.699
So it would have been easier for me
to make mistakes.

00:26:15.782 --> 00:26:18.994
But I always made the difficult choice
to grow up decent.

00:26:19.703 --> 00:26:22.497
So life has been a total fucking bore.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:24.833
But what about you?

00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:28.420
You're not even a psychopath,
so why do you make such choices?

00:26:30.213 --> 00:26:33.508
If the bank contacts me, I'll tell them
the truth. That you embezzled.

00:26:34.342 --> 00:26:35.802
You could try begging the genie.

00:26:36.678 --> 00:26:37.846
But you know, Bo-gyeong,

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:41.224
whatever you wish for,
you won't get anything. Why, do you ask?

00:26:41.308 --> 00:26:45.103
Because no matter what you wish for,
I'll wish for it all to be reversed.

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:47.731
I do believe in genies.

00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:54.362
I have a wish left, too, you see.

00:26:57.157 --> 00:26:57.991
What?

00:27:03.663 --> 00:27:05.248
To think that Satan was right.

00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:07.626
This is a clear example
of human corruption.

00:27:08.543 --> 00:27:10.378
Gu Bo-gyeong and even me.

00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:15.425
Are you all right?

00:27:18.928 --> 00:27:20.722
You know, with everyone suspecting you.

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:23.642
I grew up used to that.

00:27:23.725 --> 00:27:26.978
After all, murders and psychopaths
are closely related.

00:27:33.568 --> 00:27:37.030
Where's the highest point
in this neighborhood?

00:27:50.627 --> 00:27:52.420
You can push me if you'd like.

00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:55.215
It's been a while
since we did something like that.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.762
You won't break
in a satisfying way from up here.

00:28:01.763 --> 00:28:02.806
But you knew that, right?

00:28:06.768 --> 00:28:08.520
That's Cassiopeia over there.

00:28:09.979 --> 00:28:11.231
And that's Orion.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.025
Right, everyone seems to know those two.

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:15.360
Tell me more.

00:28:16.778 --> 00:28:17.904
I see.

00:28:17.987 --> 00:28:21.324
That explains why that's all you see
when you look it up.

00:28:23.284 --> 00:28:24.911
Even spirits only get that far?

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:31.209
Look. Wow.
It's almost like it's raining stars.

00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:32.752
Rain?

00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:34.921
No, we don't even have any alcohol.

00:28:35.463 --> 00:28:38.675
And, most importantly,
you're not pretty today.

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:41.344
I asked Min-ji again.

00:28:41.428 --> 00:28:42.721
She said stars come second.

00:28:42.804 --> 00:28:45.640
What matters more is
how pretty the other person looks.

00:28:46.349 --> 00:28:47.183
Me?

00:28:47.767 --> 00:28:50.729
Me, who's only worn the prettiest
of faces since the dawn of time?

00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:52.897
- What part of me isn't pretty?
- Your hair part.

00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:56.943
Must you wear it on that side?
Your face is a little asymmetrical.

00:28:57.569 --> 00:29:01.406
Then can't you just come to my right
and look at me from a slight angle?

00:29:02.657 --> 00:29:03.575
I don't think I can.

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:05.994
I'm not perfectly symmetrical either.

00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:09.205
How is it we still can't have
a proper conversation?

00:29:10.665 --> 00:29:13.251
Then, do you want a shoulder to lean on?

00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:16.379
Or do you maybe want me
to tousle your hair?

00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:19.632
Or, perhaps, I'll wear a coat
and walk over impressively.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.723
What's with those eyes?

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:33.313
I can't change my hair part.
I've perfected it since the start of time.

00:29:34.314 --> 00:29:36.858
- Let's go with the first one.
- The first one?

00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:40.195
Oh, my shoulder?

00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:42.989
Here.

00:29:47.327 --> 00:29:49.579
Damn you, Ki Ka-young!

00:29:49.662 --> 00:29:51.039
I wasn't fooled by you!

00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:55.335
I gave you my shoulder for you to push!

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.796
Tends to stand by his pride.

00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:05.762
Where's she gone without her phone?

00:30:05.845 --> 00:30:06.846
Ka-young!

00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:13.812
Ka-young wasn't answering her phone, so…

00:30:14.896 --> 00:30:16.689
This is the house you're staying at

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.441
for half a year?

00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:20.860
Well, you see…

00:30:23.112 --> 00:30:27.867
I am a very close friend of Ka-young's.

00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:28.785
Very.

00:30:28.868 --> 00:30:30.119
You know Ka-young?

00:30:32.705 --> 00:30:33.873
That's so strange.

00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:37.502
Where is Ka-young right now?

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:40.338
Your hair part is also not exactly…

00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:47.929
What is this, Ki Ka-young?

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:51.891
Why is that man
casually walking into this house?

00:30:52.392 --> 00:30:54.936
And how is it this lady
is casually walking out of it?

00:30:57.647 --> 00:31:00.692
- She's a close--
- Don't you dare say she's a close friend.

00:31:00.775 --> 00:31:02.318
I've known you for 14 years.

00:31:02.402 --> 00:31:03.820
Even when you were in college,

00:31:03.903 --> 00:31:07.407
you came from Daejeon to Seoul
to have gamja-tang with me.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.450
Now you suddenly have a close friend?

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:11.327
Can't you handle this like last time?

00:31:11.911 --> 00:31:13.705
You didn't even plan for this?

00:31:14.622 --> 00:31:16.249
Were you fibbing about being smart?

00:31:16.749 --> 00:31:18.418
Classy choice of words.

00:31:18.501 --> 00:31:22.088
You stay right there,
or I'll call the cops.

00:31:22.171 --> 00:31:26.217
Hey, the whole town is wild
with all this talk of corpses and stuff.

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:28.928
Come on, what is this, Ki Ka-young?

00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:30.471
Well, it's…

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:32.015
Brother!

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:40.899
I heard my older brother was here
from the Middle East,

00:31:41.482 --> 00:31:43.151
so I came to see him.

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:46.696
Right. Lee Mi-ju. Lee Beul-li.

00:31:46.779 --> 00:31:48.156
We're siblings, see?

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:49.282
Bro!

00:31:51.117 --> 00:31:52.410
Siblings?

00:31:54.787 --> 00:31:56.331
I know exactly what this is.

00:31:56.414 --> 00:31:57.874
Bong Joon Ho's Parasite.

00:31:58.708 --> 00:32:02.962
One by one, you're moving your family in
until the whole place is yours.

00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:04.964
But there's no basement here,

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.717
so is there one more living in that shed?

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.635
Come on.

00:32:19.395 --> 00:32:20.438
No way.

00:32:22.732 --> 00:32:23.816
Come here.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.318
You people.

00:32:25.401 --> 00:32:27.070
Show me your IDs right now.

00:32:28.154 --> 00:32:29.113
True friendship.

00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:31.866
That's right, you brat.
This is friendship.

00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:36.829
What are you all doing?
I want to see your IDs. Right now!

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.458
I won't tell you right now.

00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:42.085
No matter what you say, I won't.

00:32:42.168 --> 00:32:43.878
But I'll tell you everything later.

00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:46.214
Don't ask me anything about those two.

00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:48.841
Or you'd be getting in my way.

00:32:49.717 --> 00:32:50.843
When exactly is later?

00:32:50.927 --> 00:32:53.179
I don't know. Just later.

00:32:55.014 --> 00:32:55.890
Just trust me.

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:02.647
Fine. I'm sure you have a reason.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:03.648
I trust you.

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:07.318
But wasn't it three, not two?

00:33:07.402 --> 00:33:09.737
Aren't we counting the one
who was in the shed?

00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:13.866
Right. He and Lee Beul-li
are sort of a package deal.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:14.784
Yes.

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:27.547
The two female guests just checked out,
saying the town is too scary.

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:30.008
I know. I got the call.

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:33.803
Did something happen? You don't look well.

00:33:34.303 --> 00:33:37.223
You're getting on my nerves,
so you should turn in now.

00:33:37.724 --> 00:33:38.558
All right.

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:42.895
Why does he keep chopping firewood
when it's hot out?

00:33:54.407 --> 00:33:57.076
What the hell
have they left behind this time?

00:33:58.036 --> 00:33:59.370
Well, fuck me!

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:01.622
It's finally here.

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.291
It's finally appeared again!

00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:15.720
Why did it take you so damn long
to show up again?

00:34:15.803 --> 00:34:19.849
I even went to where I hit that deer
in case I needed to be there to see you.

00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:22.393
Okay. Here's my second wish.

00:34:22.477 --> 00:34:26.773
Let me take a trip back, 20 years ago,
to December 23, 2004, at 11:40.

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.323
I need to check something.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.874
CHEONGPUNG VILLAGE HALL

00:34:44.957 --> 00:34:48.377
What the hell? Why are we
in broad daylight? I said 11:40!

00:34:48.461 --> 00:34:50.129
11:40 is during the day.

00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:51.589
Fuck.

00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:54.509
You should have said 23:40
if you meant night.

00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:58.513
How am I supposed to wait until night?
I'm itching to know!

00:35:00.306 --> 00:35:03.059
Darling Jeong-hwa,
are you happy to see Ka-young?

00:35:04.143 --> 00:35:07.522
Here, take a look.
She smiles whenever she sees you.

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:10.525
Ka-young, all of those people
who say nasty things to you,

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:13.069
they only do that
because they carry doubt inside.

00:35:13.653 --> 00:35:14.987
You get me, don't you?

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:21.744
I don't know. It's too hard.

00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:27.250
So that bitch grows up
to own the auto shop.

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:29.752
That brat is a psychopath, you know.

00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:33.381
We have time to kill, so how about
we play hide-and-seek with that bitch?

00:35:43.224 --> 00:35:44.892
What the fuck was that for?

00:35:48.521 --> 00:35:51.023
Why do people keep
leaving things behind in the past?

00:35:53.901 --> 00:35:57.071
Where is it that you're trying to go?
Can you tell me exactly?

00:35:58.114 --> 00:35:59.907
{\an8}20 YEARS AGO, 23:39

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:00.950
{\an8}20 YEARS AGO, 23:40

00:36:01.033 --> 00:36:02.410
BLACK HAIR DYE

00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:05.580
Why would you even
dye your hair like this?

00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:08.249
It's not very ladylike, is it?

00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:12.003
I got some on your face.

00:36:41.115 --> 00:36:42.116
Fuck.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.910
For fuck's sake.

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:52.251
Damn it.

00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:54.712
Fuck!

00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:04.764
So it was Mom. It was Mom!

00:37:05.598 --> 00:37:09.810
I knew for sure someone was there,
yet they never reported me.

00:37:10.311 --> 00:37:12.813
I wondered why every day for 20 years.

00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:19.278
Is it really so exciting
that the witness to your crime

00:37:20.446 --> 00:37:21.614
was your mother?

00:37:21.697 --> 00:37:24.575
Mom would never be able to report me.

00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:27.036
She's got my back, just like you do.

00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:30.957
Now I can relax and get on
with killing more skanky bitches

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.959
to make this world a cleaner place.

00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:34.085
Right away!

00:37:37.713 --> 00:37:39.924
So this is how the lump of clay felt.

00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:42.760
My thought process was similar too.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.429
But this is just revolting.

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:51.352
{\an8}EOM SANG-TAE, JULY 20, 2024
MADE HIS SECOND WISH

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:55.982
{\an8}WENT BACK 20 YEARS TO CONFIRM THE WITNESS

00:37:56.065 --> 00:38:00.278
{\an8}THE WITNESS WAS HIS MOTHER

00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:11.205
Why didn't you tell me, Mom?

00:38:12.748 --> 00:38:14.375
I know everything now.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:16.794
You saw me, didn't you?

00:38:18.713 --> 00:38:22.758
If only I'd known earlier,
I wouldn't have held back for so long.

00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:34.478
Hair dye?

00:38:34.562 --> 00:38:37.857
Yes. He was dyeing
the dead corpse's hair black.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.608
Her hair was red.

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:41.986
The bastard's a serial killer.

00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:45.948
Some detectives stopped by recently,
saying a woman had gone missing in town.

00:38:48.617 --> 00:38:52.413
Given the circumstances, it's likely
she was Eom Sang-tae's victim too.

00:38:55.207 --> 00:38:56.500
Either way, thanks to you,

00:38:56.584 --> 00:38:59.378
we uncovered the real killer
behind a 20-year-old cold case.

00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:03.466
It's not thanks to me,
but thanks to the wish you made.

00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:05.134
Tell me if you're angry. I'll kill him.

00:39:05.217 --> 00:39:06.719
I'll fold him like a twig

00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:09.430
and drag him all the way to hell for you.

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:11.974
No, we can't deal with him like that.

00:39:12.058 --> 00:39:15.478
This bastard needs to be locked up.
He can go to hell after that.

00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:18.814
We'll strike when Eom Sang-tae
makes his final wish.

00:39:18.898 --> 00:39:20.358
Leave this one to me.

00:39:20.941 --> 00:39:22.026
Wow.

00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:23.778
I'm starting to wonder now.

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:26.697
Will I really be able to beat you?

00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:31.994
"If there comes a moment
that Iblis bows his head before a human,

00:39:32.078 --> 00:39:32.912
you shall

00:39:32.995 --> 00:39:34.997
slit your brother's throat."

00:39:36.749 --> 00:39:38.000
Tell me if you want to beat me.

00:39:39.335 --> 00:39:41.003
Grandma has become young again,

00:39:41.087 --> 00:39:42.671
and life is just no fun.

00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:46.717
So I'll let you win.

00:41:16.557 --> 00:41:17.850
Hello. Welcome.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.853
Here we go.

00:41:23.856 --> 00:41:25.733
- What would you like?
- A small gamja-tang.

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:28.277
A small? Which one?
With greens or aged kimchi?

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:33.866
Is the gamja-tang place up for sale?

00:41:33.949 --> 00:41:35.576
Yes. How did you know?

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:39.580
They're asking for well below
market price. Ms. Ki, are you interested?

00:41:53.469 --> 00:41:54.303
I'm back.

00:41:54.803 --> 00:41:58.098
Eat up.

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:46.730
Long time no see, Mr. Shadi.

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.691
Why'd you put the world to sleep?

00:42:48.774 --> 00:42:50.693
I knew that you would be awake.

00:42:51.443 --> 00:42:52.736
And if you're here,

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.822
it means Ejllael must be close by.

00:42:55.823 --> 00:42:59.868
I don't know
if Iblis puts up with Ejllael,

00:43:00.578 --> 00:43:02.871
but I still have bad blood with Ejllael.

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.082
He killed our brothers.

00:43:05.165 --> 00:43:09.211
I'm asking if there's any reason
for me to stop you.

00:43:09.295 --> 00:43:12.298
Do not worry.
This has nothing to do with you angels.

00:43:14.216 --> 00:43:15.426
The night is short,

00:43:17.177 --> 00:43:18.679
and my steps are heavy.

00:43:19.555 --> 00:43:21.682
They will only lead me
to the one I wish to see.

00:43:49.501 --> 00:43:51.670
We're in big trouble, boss!

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.673
We're in big trouble, Ejllael!

00:43:57.801 --> 00:43:59.970
We're in big trouble, Irem!

00:44:06.226 --> 00:44:07.061
Take a look.

00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:10.356
He's been tied up with this thread,
and he can't move.

00:44:10.856 --> 00:44:11.690
What?

00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:14.735
This black thread?

00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:17.529
You couldn't cut this,
so you called us all?

00:44:17.613 --> 00:44:18.656
I tried that at first.

00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:20.949
I don't know what this thread is,

00:44:21.033 --> 00:44:23.702
but it weighs a ton
and is impossible to cut.

00:44:23.786 --> 00:44:24.620
Is that so?

00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:27.331
I should buy some of this.

00:44:27.414 --> 00:44:28.749
I'd make good use of this.

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:30.084
What…

00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:36.507
Servant of the angel. You cannot lie.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:39.802
Only you were free to roam last night.
Tell me everything you know.

00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:43.013
I encountered Shadi last night.

00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:45.683
He put the entire world to sleep

00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:48.811
and was walking,
taking incredibly laden steps.

00:44:49.812 --> 00:44:50.979
Aren't you busy today?

00:44:51.563 --> 00:44:52.690
Who is Shadi?

00:44:52.773 --> 00:44:55.526
He's a brother
who controls sleep with song.

00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:58.153
I know Shadi paid me a visit
because I fell asleep.

00:44:58.237 --> 00:45:00.447
But it's even stranger
if this was his doing.

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:01.532
This…

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.285
This isn't Shadi's power.

00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:08.539
None of our brothers has the ability
to make such a thread.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.419
If you're all brothers, does that mean
all genies share the same birthday?

00:45:13.502 --> 00:45:15.295
Yes, they were all born on a Thursday.

00:45:15.796 --> 00:45:18.215
I was born on a Wednesday
and you, a Friday.

00:45:18.298 --> 00:45:20.884
Why invent
a birth secret for someone else?

00:45:20.968 --> 00:45:22.886
I was born on a Monday.

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:25.097
That's not what that means--

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.558
That's not what's important here!

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:30.561
You show up late
and still make small talk?

00:45:30.644 --> 00:45:33.021
You know I travel
at 50 kilometers per hour.

00:45:33.522 --> 00:45:34.982
I ran here in a frenzy.

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:38.694
Really? You looked so poised
in your pictures online.

00:45:38.777 --> 00:45:39.653
That's right.

00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:41.697
That's why I try to avoid running if I--

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.534
Shadi tied me up, so could you at least
find and bring him here, brother?

00:45:45.617 --> 00:45:47.369
You know he hates my guts.

00:45:48.203 --> 00:45:50.664
You don't look too uncomfortable.
Just stay put.

00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:53.333
If I get loose,
the first thing I'll do is kill you!

00:46:05.345 --> 00:46:08.265
Wait, did you just cut off my wrists?

00:46:08.348 --> 00:46:11.226
He said the thread was impossible to cut,
so I cut your wrists.

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:12.978
Did you want me to cut the thread?

00:46:14.229 --> 00:46:16.523
I'm sure you heard it all,
but it won't be easy to…

00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:19.485
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:24.698
Wow.

00:46:25.783 --> 00:46:28.243
Wait, that actually worked?

00:46:28.744 --> 00:46:29.703
How did that work?

00:46:29.787 --> 00:46:31.747
Who knows? Maybe I'm just strong.

00:46:32.664 --> 00:46:34.249
Or perhaps because I'm your master.

00:46:38.045 --> 00:46:39.546
I need to get to the food bank.

00:46:42.007 --> 00:46:44.551
VAT settlements are due this month,
so please excuse me.

00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:47.179
Hey, get over here. What are you hiding?

00:46:49.389 --> 00:46:51.225
Thanks for that. I need to speak to her.

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:52.267
By the way,

00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:54.353
I saw you left me out to dry
in the desert.

00:46:55.103 --> 00:46:55.938
I saw it all.

00:46:56.605 --> 00:46:59.525
That angel who just left
showed me how I died in my past life.

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:02.027
That jerk can't be serious!

00:47:04.154 --> 00:47:05.280
About that…

00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:11.954
The situation back then was a little,
you know, that way.

00:47:12.746 --> 00:47:15.916
Wow. I don't make this kind
of demand very often.

00:47:16.625 --> 00:47:17.584
Sade.

00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:19.670
- Bite her.
- What? Me?

00:47:20.254 --> 00:47:21.171
Oh, my fingers.

00:47:25.759 --> 00:47:27.427
I don't bite people, boss.

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:31.098
Of course, I know.
Dear Sade doesn't bite people.

00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:32.891
You do, right? I was scared there.

00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:37.145
But you did clear the way for a pack
of wild hounds to tear me apart.

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:39.106
Before I died.

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.191
So you saw that?

00:47:41.275 --> 00:47:44.903
Wow! Master! Please obliterate me!

00:47:44.987 --> 00:47:46.572
Come here. Get over here.

00:47:46.655 --> 00:47:49.783
If you all leave,
then who will take me out of here?

00:47:52.077 --> 00:47:53.495
Damn you, you just had to--

00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:55.163
Shall we talk about Shadi?

00:47:55.247 --> 00:47:58.584
Isn't that more urgent right now?
Otherwise, I'll keep my mouth shut.

00:47:58.667 --> 00:47:59.710
Damn you.

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.880
Shadi came to see me and tied me up.

00:48:02.963 --> 00:48:05.090
I haven't even seen him
since the 300-year war.

00:48:05.173 --> 00:48:08.760
His heavy footsteps mean
he's also tied up by that thread.

00:48:08.844 --> 00:48:10.596
He must have come to tell me that.

00:48:10.679 --> 00:48:13.599
Shadi is someone's hostage again,
just like he was back then.

00:48:13.682 --> 00:48:16.727
And you know something, and you cannot lie
under any circumstances.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.106
Was it your doing again?

00:48:21.189 --> 00:48:23.734
No. This was your doing.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:25.861
Shadi has a master.

00:48:25.944 --> 00:48:28.739
Shadi bestowed the ring he inhabited
and chose his own master.

00:48:28.822 --> 00:48:29.823
He is no hostage.

00:48:30.532 --> 00:48:32.034
This is the extent of my answer.

00:48:32.534 --> 00:48:35.746
- What do you mean this is my doing?
- I can't hear you.

00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:38.874
You're right. Whatever you say is right.
Yes, all right.

00:48:38.957 --> 00:48:41.793
Prattle away
because I just can't hear you.

00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:47.591
So who's Shadi's master?

00:48:49.134 --> 00:48:50.677
Cunning bastard.

00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:53.639
Want to know who his master is?

00:48:53.722 --> 00:48:55.057
The immortal being

00:48:55.557 --> 00:48:57.559
that your arrogance created back then.

00:49:00.354 --> 00:49:02.189
Please save Hunbish.

00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:05.192
Please let him live a long, long life.

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:07.444
Him?

00:49:34.388 --> 00:49:37.933
I don't even remember his face.
You're saying he's in town right now?

00:49:38.016 --> 00:49:40.185
No. I won't. I don't know. No such thing.

00:49:40.268 --> 00:49:42.187
Whatever you ask,
I'll answer with one of--

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:43.897
His Servant, Ejllael.

00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:47.025
Where is he? What's the color
of his front door? Shape of his roof?

00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:48.402
Bloody Satan!

00:49:49.194 --> 00:49:50.028
Damn it.

00:49:53.365 --> 00:49:56.201
Damn it! My shirt!

00:49:57.077 --> 00:49:58.161
Sade!

00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:04.334
This air. The smell of blood.

00:50:04.418 --> 00:50:08.505
Isn't this when my boss died
in her past life? 983 years ago?

00:50:08.588 --> 00:50:09.423
That's right.

00:50:09.923 --> 00:50:11.842
I made an immortal at this time.

00:50:13.385 --> 00:50:16.972
I somewhat extrapolated
from the lump of clay's wish.

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:21.268
But I can't remember his face.

00:50:22.269 --> 00:50:23.895
He'll be passing by here soon.

00:50:24.396 --> 00:50:26.231
You remember his scent

00:50:26.314 --> 00:50:28.066
and find him when we get back.

00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:32.070
He's definitely somewhere
in Cheongpung village.

00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:34.031
Yes, Master.

00:51:29.836 --> 00:51:31.588
Are you the one who saved me?

00:51:33.715 --> 00:51:35.342
My name is Hunbish.

00:51:36.676 --> 00:51:37.719
Thank you.

00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:41.389
Yeah?

00:51:43.016 --> 00:51:44.935
You didn't seem
too grateful in the future.

00:51:45.727 --> 00:51:46.561
What do you mean?

00:51:46.645 --> 00:51:48.855
There's no point in remembering my face.

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.899
I'll appear to you with a different face.

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:58.406
And don't you dare
do anything stupid to my brother.

00:51:59.741 --> 00:52:01.409
I will seek you out soon, kid.

00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:41.546

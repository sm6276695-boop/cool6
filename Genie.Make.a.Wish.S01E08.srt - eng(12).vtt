GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:08.276
My name is Hunbish.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.075
What did you see last night?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.345
Shadi brought me out of the ring.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.268
Run away.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.027
The entire world was fast asleep.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:58.243
As he left, Shadi tugged a single thread
from the rug in Father's room.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.203
He told me

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.789
to run away.

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:11.047
What did you use my thread for?

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.717
You put the world to sleep
without permission?

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:18.304
Tisah.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.205
What did you find out yesterday?

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.457
A way to release those shackles?

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.711
Or someone to release them for you?

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.590
When Iblis woke up,

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.341
he would've known I'd been there.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:02:59.387
So you found hope?

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.891
Hope that your brother
will come and save you?

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:07.061
Has it really never occurred to you

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:10.064
that if I didn't want you
putting the world to sleep,

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:13.067
I would have tied your tongue
and not your feet?

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:17.906
I was also curious to know

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.036
if that bitch would be able
to cut my thread in this life as well.

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.706
So I had been patiently waiting
for you to have a little outing.

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:33.129
Thanks to you, I finally have my answer.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.548
You're still set on this, Khalid?

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.175
Please stop.

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:38.843
Or my brother will kill you.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.261
Why would I die?

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.805
If I can just make that lamp my own…

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:45.558
Once I become the master of that lamp,

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.479
I'll be the only being
who can cut my threads,

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:53.566
which would mean
I can become the leader of all spirits!

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.282
Who is Khalid?

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.492
You scared me!

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:03.952
Why are you still here?

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:06.204
Why am I still here?

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:10.083
You all just bolted out.
How exactly was I supposed to get out?

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:11.292
Right.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.711
Wait, isn't that heavy?

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:18.174
I asked you who Khalid is.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.761
Khalid? I'm not sure. Who's that?

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:23.179
You would know, not me!

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.349
All of this happened
because you locked me up in here!

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:27.684
Cut the crap.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:28.851
I saw for myself,

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.896
and you'd have been locked up
even if it weren't for me, Satan!

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.526
That deity of yours was just using me
as a durability test for his creations.

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:39.279
You're right about that.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.324
I'll let it slide since you agreed.

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.956
I saw the sand was flowing,
so I touched it.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.208
Then I suddenly saw it.

00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:54.377
What did you see?

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:03.720
In what seemed like the distant past,
there was a boy weaving a rug in the sun.

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:06.556
And I was there beside him.

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:08.850
I called his name.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.268
Khalid.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:14.981
Are you sure?

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:18.151
I'm sure.
I was just as pretty as I am now.

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:24.866
For starters, get me out of here.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:26.784
Hey!

00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:30.038
You're getting it everywhere.

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:38.880
Grandma. Try shaking your arm.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:40.715
Is it heavy?

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.760
This teeny thing? What is this?

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.219
Is this what's trendy now?

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.555
Oh Pan-geum, try breaking the thread.

00:05:47.638 --> 00:05:49.640
You want me to break it? Like this?

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.143
It breaks.

00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:54.729
It doesn't work between humans.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.190
Tie me with it.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:05:59.776
You should brace yourself.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.111
I'm a spirit, so I have…

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.781
I have infinite magic…

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.413
There you go.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:13.623
You apparently don't.

00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:18.336
It doesn't work
from spirits to humans either.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:20.463
Now tie yourself up.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:21.464
What?

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:24.008
Right, well,

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.469
you know,

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.888
you can never rule out chance,
and I don't want to--

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:30.723
- Do it.
- I'm doing it.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.775
It's done. Now break it.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.610
Please?

00:06:43.694 --> 00:06:45.446
Grandma, try breaking the thread.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.408
Goodness me.
What is this, some kind of mutt training?

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.575
Gosh.

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.418
What the… It broke so easily before.

00:06:59.877 --> 00:07:01.379
- Wait here.
- Wait!

00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:03.381
Let's see. Yes, these.

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:05.591
Okay.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.135
Great.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:11.848
What is this?

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.101
Wait right here.

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:18.646
- The straw cutter will be in the shed.
- Are you sure you even tried?

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.984
It only works
when a spirit ties another spirit.

00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:25.653
- That's the thread's rule.
- Okay, I get it.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.530
Just break it already.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.031
By the way,

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.950
that thread reeks of blood.

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.536
- What?
- Blood?

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.004
So it was originally white.

00:07:43.087 --> 00:07:45.047
It looks black because it's bloodstained.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.468
Given the information we have
and the fact that I can cut it,

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.094
this must be my blood.

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:53.264
That's shocking. Try breaking it already.

00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:55.433
Let's take a detailed,
thorough look at it.

00:07:57.935 --> 00:07:59.687
About how you left me out to dry.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.606
The grains of my ashes were very fine.

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:04.150
You must have taken extra care
to air me out real good.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.403
Grandma! Haven't you found
the straw cutter yet?

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.447
- Hey.
- We should grab the big cutter!

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.781
Hey, Master!

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:14.285
Wait, just get this…

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.581
Quit stuffing your face, jerk.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.847
Are you going to stay in here?

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:38.100
What's with you guys?

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:41.479
You, for one, and everyone else
in the front yard. Who are you?

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.065
How is Hun your father?

00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:47.193
Enough to pay off your debts
and gamble to your heart's content.

00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:48.736
You said that's all you needed.

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:51.614
So why are you asking questions now?

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:55.284
I didn't know I was getting into something
with lives at stake!

00:08:58.037 --> 00:08:59.497
I can't afford to make mistakes.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:02.583
I'm his dad, after all.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.219
Why the hell are you all so helpless
against a damn kid?

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.640
You're asking that too.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.644
Father's previous parents
all asked the same question.

00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:26.440
You know something? To orphans,
the entire world is nothing but horror.

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:44.709
But if you've lived
the greatest horror of all,

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.421
everything else pales by comparison.

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:06.272
The weak get torn apart,
and the strong are rewarded with meat.

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:09.400
That's all we need.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.625
So don't bother trying so hard.

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:28.252
No matter what you do,
we'll only listen to Father.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:30.463
This bullshit ends today.

00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:33.174
Tomorrow, we're getting you
some hiking gear.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.524
I keep getting stuck here.

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:55.321
Gosh, beauty really is pain.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.698
Are you getting an extra shot?

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.742
I won't ask anything else.

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.661
Just whether you want an extra shot.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.914
Extra shot, please.

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:07.958
What about whipped cream?
And caramel syrup?

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:11.379
More questions. Silly me.

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.840
I could just add everything
to make it tasty.

00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:22.932
I wasn't trying to be funny.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.644
This isn't a question.
I'm just jumping to conclusions,

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:28.145
so you don't have to answer.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.816
Is your name Lee Mi-ju?

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.026
It's fake, right?

00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:36.779
And you're not Lee Beul-li's sister.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.620
I'd really like an answer
to this one though.

00:11:45.162 --> 00:11:49.375
Are you being hunted by the government
or taking on the whole country?

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:52.962
Gosh, how could you say such a thing?
It's absolutely not that!

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:55.965
Good, then.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.592
And this is just to reassure you.

00:11:58.676 --> 00:11:59.885
Ka-young

00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:02.012
is as good as they come.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:07.184
I just mean you should ignore
whatever you hear others saying about her.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:11.397
My goodness.

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.608
Goodness, I'm so grateful.

00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:17.862
Wait, you're tearing up?

00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:34.086
What's with the cherry blossoms?

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:37.965
Is this even the right season for that?

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:47.600
All right, everyone.
I'll show you everything. Through here--

00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:48.934
Sir, we can't let you pass.

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:52.188
Didn't you hear that I was the first
to discover it and call it in?

00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:53.731
I'll take a quick peek.

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:56.859
Everyone says that,
based on the diameter of the pelvis found,

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:59.111
the corpse is most likely female.

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:01.197
Apparently, she originally had red hair,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.700
but it was dyed after she was killed!

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:08.245
That means this is a very serious crime.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:10.164
And who discovered it?

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:21.425
Ms. Ki?

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.595
What brings you here, Ms. Ki?

00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:29.183
This was stuck in your tail light
when you left your car with me.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.561
What on earth do you mean?

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:34.772
What is this?

00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:36.524
Take a look and see for yourself.

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:40.611
To me, it looks like a woman's
bleached blonde hair.

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:48.494
Why give me this?

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.247
I don't understand.

00:13:51.747 --> 00:13:52.873
What's going on here?

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:54.750
Your face tells me you do understand.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.836
You're behind it, aren't you?

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.838
The skeleton they found.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.216
And I'm guessing you did the same
to the owner of that hair.

00:14:02.716 --> 00:14:03.676
Ms. Ki.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.263
Someone might seriously get
the wrong idea if they heard you.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:10.057
By the way…

00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:13.769
did you come alone?

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:15.229
Of course not.

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:17.940
I'm here with someone
you'd never dream of.

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:33.289
Don't waste my time and listen up.

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:37.042
The police are looking for this woman.
Look familiar?

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:38.836
She has the same hair color too.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.214
I actually looked
in your truck bed that day.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:45.009
Everything else made sense,
but one thing felt out of place.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:47.720
BLACK HAIR DYE

00:14:47.803 --> 00:14:49.305
And then I saw the news.

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:52.349
Oh, he dyes their hair
after their death. How fun.

00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:55.185
You think that's fun?

00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:58.814
Well, every masterpiece needs a signature.

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:03.485
That's why I came. To give you a gift.

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:04.820
Here.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.454
You're actually giving me this

00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:17.082
instead of taking it to the cops?

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:19.209
Why?

00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:29.178
I guess someone's
digestive system is working well.

00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:31.180
You should finish up.

00:15:34.975 --> 00:15:36.310
Come on, not that.

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:38.771
Finish up the bowing.

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:44.526
The same reason you had me
fix your tail light, I suppose.

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:46.737
Because you and I are alike.

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:53.744
I knew it.

00:15:53.827 --> 00:15:55.454
I knew you'd be just like me!

00:15:55.537 --> 00:15:57.539
No. Unlike you, I'd never make a mistake.

00:15:58.707 --> 00:16:02.753
If only there were a way
for you to fix that error.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.839
There is a way. Don't worry about that.

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:09.051
If this all works out well,
why don't we do the next one together?

00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:10.719
Let's talk after you fix it.

00:16:11.845 --> 00:16:13.347
I don't work with amateurs.

00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:32.908
Why did you do that?
Why did you give the culprit the evidence?

00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:37.079
He's the only one who knows
where the missing woman is buried.

00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:40.666
If I took that to the cops
and they caught him,

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:43.919
then that bastard
would use his last wish to escape.

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.629
That woman would be lost forever.

00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:48.674
That's why I made it
so he'd make his third wish sooner.

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:53.345
I don't think I'm the one who should be
taking on the immortal being.

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:58.142
Eom Sang-tae will surely want to go
back in time to get rid of the evidence.

00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:00.477
When Eom Sang-tae makes his final wish,

00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:02.813
give my notebook to my past self.

00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:04.064
Why should I?

00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:06.358
Let's make it clear.
I only fulfill wishes--

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:09.403
You're a big fat liar.
The writing on the bottom of the lamp.

00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:12.781
The translation says
it's the date it was made.

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:14.408
You translated it?

00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:17.453
It says it was made in the year 1061.
Haven't you seen it?

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.288
Do you check beneath your floors?

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.669
OCTOBER 24, 1061

00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:26.962
You're right.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:30.799
Did you not harp on about being locked up
for 983 years because of me?

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.384
But you're off by 20 years.

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:35.262
Did you goof around for 20 years
and then get locked up?

00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:36.346
I'm sure I didn't!

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.016
I counted every single year
with extra precision…

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.518
Or so I thought… so what's this?

00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:43.937
Master. I found the smell.

00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:44.980
Right.

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.565
What smell?

00:17:46.648 --> 00:17:48.734
I've been doing my own investigation.

00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:02.039
It's actually a little different
from the original scent,

00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:03.624
but not completely.

00:18:04.124 --> 00:18:06.376
I'm not sure why, but either way,

00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:09.213
the immortal one's scent
is coming from that house.

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:16.637
It seems Shadi is here too.

00:18:22.851 --> 00:18:24.436
You want us to visit Dubai?

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:25.771
Why?

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:29.691
I have a brother in Dubai who'd know
what went down when I was locked up.

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:32.945
But we don't know when
Eom Sang-tae will make his final wish.

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:36.657
I can come, wherever I am.
And the notebook is in the lamp.

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:39.535
I guess you're right.

00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:42.121
But why should I go?

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.040
Because I'd be safest by your side?

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:48.293
No. Because I'd be safest by your side.

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.754
What if I get tied up again?

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:04.351
I was a little careless, wasn't I?

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:08.522
What a motley crew.

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:13.026
I see. Is this one
finally being kicked out?

00:19:14.194 --> 00:19:15.028
In your dreams.

00:19:16.196 --> 00:19:18.615
I'm pretty sure I only asked you to come.

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:21.994
The people who are safest by my side
need to come with us.

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:25.330
I've got things to take care of there,
so I need you

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:27.541
to take good care of Mi-ju for me.

00:19:27.624 --> 00:19:29.543
She's never been abroad before.

00:19:29.626 --> 00:19:32.045
Didn't you say these two were siblings?

00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:34.214
Now this is her first trip to Dubai?

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:37.551
- We're new siblings.
- We're new siblings.

00:19:40.053 --> 00:19:42.764
Whether you're siblings or sisters,
we're headed to Dubai.

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:44.641
And the tickets are first class.

00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:42.157
You're cute from every angle.

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:45.118
How did you get here, exactly?
I didn't see you in first class.

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:47.955
How? I got here by something else. A lam--

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:52.125
Yeah, okay. Who cares how you got here?

00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:54.795
And we're getting picked up
in a limo, no less.

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:58.340
For starters,
let's take the limo to the hotel and eat.

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:00.092
Eat as much as you want, Min-ji.

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:03.178
We'll head to Old Dubai first.

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:04.680
Why there?

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.071
- See that jar here?
- What?

00:21:21.154 --> 00:21:23.699
- You want me to buy it for you?
- No.

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:25.659
Could you rub it for me?

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.287
If I do it, no one will come.

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:51.310
Song Hye-kyo!

00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:53.937
Is that you?

00:21:54.021 --> 00:21:55.689
Is this a famous face?

00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:58.025
You rubbed my jar so vigorously

00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:01.653
that I just chose a face I liked
from your region on Netflix.

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:07.117
You set me up?

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:08.994
Piss off.

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:12.873
Do you happen to be a genie too?

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.752
You made her rub it
without an explanation?

00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:20.047
Me? I'm his ex-girlfriend.

00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:23.383
Oh, Jinniya?

00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:28.764
It's been a really long time, hasn't it?

00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:31.058
Could we chat for a moment?

00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:33.810
A moment? Given our past,
would a moment really be enough?

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.481
Hand over the coffee cup set
I bought for you in the BC era.

00:22:45.989 --> 00:22:48.408
I wouldn't still have that.
I bet it's a relic by now.

00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:51.203
Then what about the rug I gave you?
At least give that back.

00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:55.374
That too. It got worn out over time.

00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:58.293
It probably helped date palms
grow tall and strong.

00:22:58.377 --> 00:22:59.586
Well then,

00:22:59.669 --> 00:23:01.463
enjoy your chat.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.965
I'll see you later. You're dead meat.

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:08.512
Wait, you're that bitch from back then.

00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:13.600
And you're a bitch who also knows me?
Where I'm from, reincarnation is a thing.

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:19.272
We just met, and she's calling me a bitch?

00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:20.482
Hey.

00:23:21.024 --> 00:23:23.276
Do you think we could go
to your jar for now?

00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:25.570
Do you think I'm insane?

00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:28.156
I must be insane

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.367
to let you back in here.

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:34.788
I guess the interior is
a lot more understated now.

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:37.249
Time sure is a cruel mistress.

00:23:37.332 --> 00:23:39.292
Just spit it out. What? What is it?

00:23:39.376 --> 00:23:40.794
Why have you come to see me?

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.171
I just have two quick questions.

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:47.467
Have you ever taken on
a different appearance just to trick me?

00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:50.178
Like you did today.

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:53.974
Did you ever take on the face
of the human woman you just saw

00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:58.270
and, you know,
smile widely and prettily at me?

00:23:58.353 --> 00:24:01.356
Get out. And would you just die already?

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.191
It really wasn't you?

00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:05.485
Okay, then.

00:24:05.569 --> 00:24:08.822
Do you remember our brother,
the one who controlled sleep?

00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:11.158
Shadi?

00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:12.617
- Yes.
- What about him?

00:24:13.201 --> 00:24:15.287
I haven't seen him in about 600 years.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.874
He put me to sleep and left me tied up
with thread that's impossible to break.

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:20.333
Know anything about that?

00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:23.003
The thread was unbreakable?

00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:28.925
Shadi had a son with a human woman.

00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:30.635
He wove rugs.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.221
But the boy died.

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:36.766
He was half human and half spirit,
so he lived a mortal life.

00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:40.520
Shadi had a son?

00:24:49.738 --> 00:24:54.159
Now Shadi can only sing
when you desire, Father.

00:24:55.785 --> 00:24:57.329
Back at the festival that time,

00:24:57.913 --> 00:24:59.581
I saw Iblis.

00:25:07.589 --> 00:25:12.594
He had the same face
he wore 963 years ago.

00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:16.056
If my brother wants to hide,
you'll never recognize him.

00:25:16.139 --> 00:25:21.686
I may not recognize him,
but you most certainly would.

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.022
If I eliminate the lamp's master,

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:28.109
you will bring me Iblis's lamp, won't you?

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.248
Was his son's name Khalid by any chance?

00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:44.709
I wouldn't know his name.

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:49.756
In any case, after all that fuss,
you seriously sought her out again?

00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:52.342
I didn't seek her out.
She was reborn and found my lamp…

00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:53.426
Wait.

00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:55.345
Hold up.

00:25:56.846 --> 00:26:00.016
How come you recognize Ki Ka-young?
She died at eight in her past life.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.726
What are you talking about?

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.020
Because of her,
you took an entire city, and…

00:26:05.313 --> 00:26:06.565
Damn it.

00:26:07.065 --> 00:26:08.900
This must be the 20 years he sealed.

00:26:10.277 --> 00:26:12.279
Hey, get lost already.

00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:15.407
You and I never met, all right?

00:26:16.283 --> 00:26:18.410
Hey, wait. What does that even mean?

00:26:22.622 --> 00:26:23.915
My memories were sealed?

00:26:28.712 --> 00:26:29.629
But…

00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:55.155
Nice look, Zahara.

00:26:55.655 --> 00:26:58.617
Where are all those countless
beautiful flowers of yours?

00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:03.580
This is the only flower left.
The immortal's one.

00:27:13.089 --> 00:27:14.341
Anyway,

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.761
have you heard that Iblis got out?

00:27:20.513 --> 00:27:22.682
Has Iblis's punishment ended?

00:27:23.558 --> 00:27:24.601
Where is he now?

00:27:26.686 --> 00:27:28.938
All of your brothers
are in the land of Goryeo.

00:27:29.022 --> 00:27:31.524
Even Shadi is there, getting on my nerves.

00:27:32.942 --> 00:27:36.363
Anyway, Iblis may pay you a visit
very soon.

00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:37.697
So keep your mouth shut.

00:27:39.407 --> 00:27:42.369
No matter what Iblis asks,
do not reveal what you remember.

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.668
You remember your grave mistake,

00:27:50.377 --> 00:27:51.336
don't you?

00:27:59.135 --> 00:28:00.512
Iblis went to meet who?

00:28:01.304 --> 00:28:02.514
Jinniya.

00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:04.391
They must have met by now.

00:28:04.474 --> 00:28:06.184
He asked me where she was.

00:28:06.267 --> 00:28:08.603
Your arrogance could reach the heavens.

00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:12.440
I've just returned from restraining
Zahara and what? Jinniya?

00:28:18.822 --> 00:28:21.533
Since when have I let you act
without my permission?

00:28:22.158 --> 00:28:25.704
If the kindhearted Jinniya let anything
slip, he'll chase that lead for sure.

00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:28.164
Even if it means shaking down
every last brother!

00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:30.041
I have…

00:28:31.668 --> 00:28:32.669
wronged you.

00:28:32.752 --> 00:28:36.339
I blocked your ears so you would not hear,
yet you still chirped away.

00:28:36.965 --> 00:28:39.509
I shall take that voice
which says whatever it pleases.

00:28:41.094 --> 00:28:42.554
I trust you'll take good care

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:45.515
of the one thing you have left.

00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:17.088
Why do you keep following me?

00:29:17.714 --> 00:29:21.801
Master told me to protect you
just in case anything happens.

00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:24.095
He sure is watching me closely
in case I die.

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:27.223
He has waited a thousand years,
so he must be biding his time.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.810
He's already had
his once-in-a-lifetime romance.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.438
What caused the breakup anyway?

00:29:33.521 --> 00:29:35.440
So you figured it out?

00:29:35.523 --> 00:29:36.483
Irem dumped me.

00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:40.570
What's with the sudden confession?
I was asking about Iblis and Jinniya.

00:29:40.653 --> 00:29:42.864
Right, them. So you saw.

00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:46.159
With them, too,
my master was dumped by Jinniya.

00:29:46.826 --> 00:29:48.578
- Why?
- I thought you saw her.

00:29:48.661 --> 00:29:52.457
Jinniya is incredibly beautiful.
My master really doesn't measure up.

00:29:55.168 --> 00:29:58.838
About all the wiper fluid you drank.
I'll have to dock it from your pay.

00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:00.840
All of a sudden?

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:20.777
Goodness me, how much gold is this?

00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:24.113
Over there. That way!

00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:30.119
I guess you don't know much about it.

00:30:30.203 --> 00:30:32.080
That sort of illness can't be cured.

00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:37.752
She always takes her medication.
She even sets reminders to take them.

00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:41.047
They're just sleeping pills
and a sort of craving suppressant.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.342
The rest is basically candy
to put her grandma at ease.

00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:46.636
Don't tell her grandma though.

00:30:49.597 --> 00:30:52.308
I guess she has… a lot of secrets.

00:30:52.892 --> 00:30:53.726
Mi-ju?

00:30:54.227 --> 00:30:56.145
That look on your face is a big no.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.608
She may not have any emotions,
but she's totally amazing.

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.902
The meds are just a helping hand.

00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:05.864
Is that so? That's right. You're right.

00:31:05.947 --> 00:31:08.575
Whose words would I believe, if not yours?

00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:10.869
You're my dear Ka-young's best friend.

00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:14.455
So stop concerning yourself
with other women, and focus on me.

00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:19.544
I'm tall,
so I've never bought heels before.

00:31:20.628 --> 00:31:22.213
Should I buy these or not?

00:31:23.673 --> 00:31:26.259
The shoe has found its way
to its true owner.

00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:29.429
Then absolutely buy them.
I'll get them for you.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.057
Can we get these? We'll--

00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:35.935
You must be out of your mind.
Do you know how much these cost?

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:39.689
- You should be stopping me.
- Why? Just wear them out.

00:31:39.772 --> 00:31:43.693
I have a ton of money. I'm super rich
from trading stocks, you know.

00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:46.613
I just want to buy you something.

00:31:48.448 --> 00:31:49.532
Okay?

00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:58.291
This blade here is called
Muttalib's Sword or Iblis's Rage.

00:31:58.374 --> 00:32:02.337
According to legend, Muttalib,
the outsider, stole Iblis's treasure,

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.215
and Iblis, enraged,
struck this sword down as a warning.

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:08.593
No one has been able
to remove it since then,

00:32:08.676 --> 00:32:13.556
so when developing this city,
they created a square and built around it.

00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:33.242
Why is Shaytan…

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:36.746
Leisurely sightseeing, are we?

00:32:36.829 --> 00:32:38.539
What? No.

00:32:42.251 --> 00:32:44.629
I heard you went to the desert,
so I went for a walk.

00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:48.800
So is that really your rage?

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.176
What is?

00:32:59.769 --> 00:33:01.896
What the… Why is that there?

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:16.786
So this sword really is your rage?

00:33:16.869 --> 00:33:19.080
Rage might be a bit of a stretch.

00:33:20.915 --> 00:33:24.002
But it is my sword.
Wait, so why is it stuck in here?

00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:28.840
What? It really is mine.

00:33:28.923 --> 00:33:30.633
Maybe I got drunk and left it

00:33:31.759 --> 00:33:32.677
here?

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.179
That happened every so often.

00:33:35.763 --> 00:33:36.848
Put it back. Now.

00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:38.558
It's a tourist site now.

00:33:38.641 --> 00:33:40.768
And that's a rule. One of Dubai's rules!

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:42.520
I was just putting it back.

00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:46.274
I only carried it around to show off
in the Middle Ages.

00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:50.153
Seeing how much people like it
does make me feel proud.

00:33:51.654 --> 00:33:54.699
I guess I'll just leave it
until I figure out why it's here.

00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:06.794
- Didn't I just move it?
- Sure. Who's next?

00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:09.380
You don't even have 1,000 won.
What was your treasure?

00:34:09.464 --> 00:34:12.175
The tea set your ex bought you?
Or the rug your ex--

00:34:12.258 --> 00:34:16.095
That reminds me.
Who was that woman we saw at the airport?

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.347
I've been itching to know.

00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:22.435
Her? Min-ji's ex-girlfriend.
Like someone else, her ex-girlfriend.

00:34:22.518 --> 00:34:23.478
Right.

00:34:24.479 --> 00:34:27.273
So that's why they exchanged
such longing looks.

00:34:27.356 --> 00:34:30.860
So, ex-girlfriends are to be longed for?
Did you long for Jinniya too?

00:34:30.943 --> 00:34:33.154
Why do we keep talking in circles?

00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:37.867
Wait, then why was Min-ji's ex
glaring at you?

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.495
Who knows? She was always that way.

00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:44.749
We're having gamja-tang again?

00:34:45.374 --> 00:34:49.045
- Do you even know what today is?
- Of course I do. Our 300-day anniversary.

00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:50.755
I'm sorry.

00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:53.299
But I already made these plans.

00:34:53.966 --> 00:34:54.842
I'm done with this.

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:58.346
Of the thousands of dishes out there,
why does it have to be gamja-tang?

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.891
Not many dishes let you enjoy
the marrow in each joint.

00:35:01.974 --> 00:35:04.310
Would you just shut up
so the two of us can talk?

00:35:06.562 --> 00:35:09.482
Choi Min-ji. I can't take this anymore.
Choose. Is it her or me?

00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:12.235
Leave.

00:35:14.028 --> 00:35:15.363
I loved you.

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:21.953
Fine. Have a great life or whatever.

00:35:26.707 --> 00:35:28.793
She wished you well. Why the tears?

00:35:29.418 --> 00:35:31.671
Just see her. See her and see me too.

00:35:33.881 --> 00:35:35.883
That's just not possible.

00:35:40.888 --> 00:35:43.474
Wow, what a heartbreaking story.

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:47.353
I've got a one-sided crush too, actually.

00:35:47.854 --> 00:35:49.605
She has a cute, fluffy coat--

00:35:49.689 --> 00:35:51.023
No one asked you.

00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:55.236
Where should we go today?
Today's our last day here.

00:35:55.903 --> 00:35:58.906
Ka-young said we had somewhere to go,
just the two of us.

00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:01.701
The two of you? Why? Where?

00:36:05.413 --> 00:36:06.664
My goodness.

00:36:09.208 --> 00:36:10.668
Ka-young!

00:36:11.294 --> 00:36:13.754
Hey, come and help me apply this.

00:36:14.922 --> 00:36:15.923
Here.

00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:20.261
I told you to ditch pain relief patches
and see a doctor.

00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:22.513
These work like a charm.

00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:25.933
If I see a doctor,
they'll just tell me to get surgery.

00:36:26.017 --> 00:36:27.935
No way am I letting a knife near me.

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:30.479
It's my dream to be
in the Miss Korea pageant.

00:36:30.563 --> 00:36:32.940
And you never know,
I might still have a shot.

00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:37.195
My mom made a huge fuss
when I got married.

00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:41.490
She was saying I should be hitting salons
in Myeong-dong, not getting married.

00:36:41.574 --> 00:36:42.783
Should I be laughing?

00:36:47.997 --> 00:36:50.541
Grandma, do you miss Mom?

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:52.043
Mom?

00:36:52.668 --> 00:36:55.922
Of course I miss her. That's a given.

00:36:57.048 --> 00:37:00.343
She passed away
less than a year after I got married.

00:37:00.426 --> 00:37:02.386
No, not your mom, my mom.

00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:06.849
Your daughter.

00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:09.644
Right.

00:37:12.021 --> 00:37:13.147
Well, I…

00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:16.234
I do think about her.

00:37:16.817 --> 00:37:17.693
But

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:21.113
she hasn't even visited
in 20 years, so, well…

00:37:23.532 --> 00:37:24.659
That damn girl.

00:37:25.993 --> 00:37:27.036
So you do miss her.

00:37:40.508 --> 00:37:44.637
My goodness. Goodness me.

00:38:18.504 --> 00:38:21.590
Mom had a far better mom
than she deserved.

00:38:24.677 --> 00:38:25.928
How infuriating.

00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:43.029
Hey, you psycho bitch!

00:38:43.112 --> 00:38:45.448
Just go ahead and make your wish first!

00:38:47.366 --> 00:38:48.743
CLOSED TODAY

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:52.038
You really think I'll make mine first
just because you're holding out?

00:38:52.121 --> 00:38:55.416
You have no fucking idea
how much of an opportunity this is!

00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:57.293
Hey!

00:39:09.597 --> 00:39:11.307
Mom, are you divorcing Dad?

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.768
First you get fired, and now this?

00:39:14.268 --> 00:39:17.271
You get out too.
You said you wanted to live alone.

00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:19.732
Really? You're getting me my own place?

00:39:19.815 --> 00:39:21.650
What, do I owe you a place?

00:39:22.151 --> 00:39:25.112
You're on your own from now on.
I could just not give birth to you.

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:28.866
What are you talking about?
Are you saying you regret having me?

00:39:29.575 --> 00:39:31.869
So you can resent me,
but I can't resent you?

00:39:33.287 --> 00:39:34.789
You made me regret it, damn it!

00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:37.458
I gave you two chances,

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:40.628
and you still managed
to screw everything up!

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.891
So this is your final wish.

00:39:56.894 --> 00:39:58.020
It is.

00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:00.898
My final wish…

00:40:07.363 --> 00:40:09.448
is for you to forget

00:40:10.449 --> 00:40:11.992
I already made two wishes.

00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:18.541
Alas, the greed of humans.

00:40:32.138 --> 00:40:33.264
It's been fulfilled.

00:40:35.057 --> 00:40:36.350
Really?

00:40:40.146 --> 00:40:42.857
Humans always end up
falling into this trap.

00:40:44.066 --> 00:40:44.984
Think about it.

00:40:45.067 --> 00:40:48.362
If the wish that man made
after 72 years had actually worked,

00:40:49.905 --> 00:40:52.533
would I have remembered that story
and told it to you?

00:40:54.493 --> 00:40:55.411
What?

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:18.392
KANG IM-SEON, AUGUST 2, 2024
MADE HER FINAL…

00:41:21.562 --> 00:41:22.521
I guess

00:41:23.355 --> 00:41:24.273
I'm going to lose.

00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:28.152
Not yet. That's just one person.

00:41:28.736 --> 00:41:30.154
We have the mutt and YouTuber.

00:41:30.237 --> 00:41:33.657
But Eom Sang-tae and Gu Bo-gyeong
are already a done deal.

00:41:35.117 --> 00:41:36.160
Listen carefully.

00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:39.872
You still have one final wish.
You can just undo all of this.

00:41:39.955 --> 00:41:40.998
Just wish for it.

00:41:41.081 --> 00:41:42.208
I can't do that.

00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:44.502
If I do, I can't catch Eom Sang-tae, and…

00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:48.547
you would lose.

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:58.724
By the way, does everyone give up
so easily after the three wishes?

00:41:59.225 --> 00:42:00.726
Don't they say, "Just one more"?

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.612
So their memories disappear.

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:15.908
The moment their final wish is granted,

00:42:16.492 --> 00:42:20.371
they forget who they met,
what they lost in order to gain something,

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:23.666
and everything related to you.

00:42:24.959 --> 00:42:25.793
Is that right?

00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:33.342
Does that mean…

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.555
I will too?

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:50.943
But will you

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:53.654
remember me?

00:42:56.782 --> 00:42:57.783
Yes.

00:43:14.466 --> 00:43:15.718
That's not very fair.

00:44:45.557 --> 00:44:46.767
I visited Dubai.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:47.976
It's a necklace.

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:52.481
Of all things?

00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:54.525
What's with the sign language?

00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:57.027
Wait, your neck. Were you hurt?

00:44:57.111 --> 00:44:59.446
Don't tell me he took your voice too?

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.408
Damn that Ejllael!
I won't just let this slide!

00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:05.285
Hey! Are you insane? Get back here!

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.501
Let go. Let go of me, damn it!

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:16.046
Ejllael, you're evil!

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.340
Just let go! Come on!

00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:20.926
Ejllael, you're evil!

00:45:21.009 --> 00:45:23.095
What the hell is going on here?

00:45:23.178 --> 00:45:25.514
How dare you lay your hands
on a mythical beast!

00:45:26.014 --> 00:45:27.683
This beast of yours bit me first!

00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:31.103
Take him right now and piss off,
or I'll obliterate him!

00:45:31.186 --> 00:45:34.273
All right. I'll take him
and piss off for you.

00:45:39.153 --> 00:45:44.783
How far are you throwing me?

00:46:20.486 --> 00:46:21.320
Wow.

00:46:48.514 --> 00:46:50.849
Hey. Let's stop. I'm wiped out.

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:52.559
Fine.

00:46:53.936 --> 00:46:54.978
Just answer me this.

00:46:55.562 --> 00:46:57.314
You said I stole one of your feathers

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:00.317
before I was locked up, didn't you?

00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:02.778
What exactly did I do

00:47:04.029 --> 00:47:04.947
with that feather?

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.616
How the hell would I know that?

00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:09.201
At least tell me when it was.

00:47:09.701 --> 00:47:11.870
How long before I was locked up?

00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:15.249
I've got a 20-year hole in my memory.

00:47:19.711 --> 00:47:21.547
Who said that? Did Jinniya say that?

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.093
Wait, you're that bitch from back then.

00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:29.263
So you all know something.

00:47:30.806 --> 00:47:33.809
Fine. For now,
just take the life of that immortal.

00:47:34.393 --> 00:47:37.396
He'll come after Ki Ka-young
because she broke the thread.

00:47:39.314 --> 00:47:40.232
How would I do that?

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:43.277
You're overlooking three things.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.238
First. Even I can't take the life
of an immortal.

00:47:46.321 --> 00:47:48.615
Just how would I go about
revoking your magic?

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:50.909
Second. The immortal
isn't after Ki Ka-young.

00:47:50.993 --> 00:47:52.452
He's after you.

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:54.496
He wants to become your master.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:57.958
And third.

00:47:58.542 --> 00:47:59.751
I told you this already.

00:47:59.835 --> 00:48:01.545
Shadi is not a hostage.

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:04.923
That immortal…

00:48:07.092 --> 00:48:08.677
is actually Shadi's son.

00:48:11.013 --> 00:48:12.014
His son?

00:48:17.269 --> 00:48:19.229
But I heard Shadi's son was dead.

00:49:03.523 --> 00:49:04.608
Aren't you scared?

00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:10.197
Do you go hiking often?

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.114
No.

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:12.783
This is my first time.

00:49:13.408 --> 00:49:15.452
Rough trail though. It almost killed me.

00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:17.746
Either way, it's good to see you.

00:49:25.379 --> 00:49:26.380
Ka-young.

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.549
How many wishes do you have left?

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.056
I thought it was particularly quiet today.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.518
Move. You're not the one
really asking that question.

00:49:39.601 --> 00:49:40.519
So you're aware.

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.772
But, you see, I don't know a thing.

00:49:43.855 --> 00:49:46.066
So please just give me a straight answer.

00:49:46.733 --> 00:49:48.360
They want me to ask you that.

00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:50.696
Those guys are terrifying.

00:49:51.279 --> 00:49:52.614
They even kill people.

00:49:53.615 --> 00:49:56.159
The moment I answer that question,
I'll die anyway.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:59.204
And my loved ones
would be in danger again.

00:50:00.497 --> 00:50:01.415
Is that right?

00:50:05.377 --> 00:50:07.629
It's just that I've racked up some debt.

00:50:08.588 --> 00:50:10.674
So I just need to do
what I was sent to do.

00:50:13.468 --> 00:50:15.387
I was told to do this
if you didn't answer.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.056
I mean it when I say

00:50:19.182 --> 00:50:20.767
this is nothing personal.

00:50:31.278 --> 00:50:36.491
The auto shop. The cars I fix.
My adjustable wrench. Frogs.

00:50:39.953 --> 00:50:42.706
The sound of dental scaling. Gamja-tang.

00:50:43.415 --> 00:50:44.416
Min-ji.

00:50:45.751 --> 00:50:46.877
Grandma.

00:50:48.628 --> 00:50:52.799
"I will now also give you sorrow."

00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:55.385
Lee Mi-ju.

00:50:58.972 --> 00:51:00.807
Kki Kka-young.

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:03.477
I just need 1,000 won.
Ki Ka-young. Ki Ka-young!

00:51:04.269 --> 00:51:07.272
I'm taking care of you now.
I can't do this if I lose.

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:30.170
What do you think you're doing?
Do you really want to die?

00:51:31.713 --> 00:51:33.882
So this is what they call fear.

00:51:35.842 --> 00:51:37.719
Fear is really scary.

00:51:39.721 --> 00:51:41.640
But I didn't fall on purpose.

00:51:42.307 --> 00:51:43.975
Then you should've made a wish.

00:51:44.059 --> 00:51:45.685
A wish to be saved!

00:51:46.895 --> 00:51:47.854
You almost died.

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:49.731
If I made my final wish…

00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:56.613
I'd forget you.

00:52:08.875 --> 00:52:10.961
You damn psychopath!

00:55:54.142 --> 00:55:59.147

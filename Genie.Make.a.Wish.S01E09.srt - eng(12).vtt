GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.281
What the actual fuck?

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.330
Please spare me. Please.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.373
With those hands that pushed a person,

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.542
you're begging for your life?

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.961
Your damn hands

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:28.671
know no shame.

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:44.604
We've confirmed his existence,
but you're now a widow, Mom.

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:47.190
It was about time.

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:53.071
The question is, did he save Ki Ka-young
on his own, or did she wish to be saved?

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:54.489
That level of rage

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:56.866
suggests she didn't wish it.

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:12.715
Father!

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:18.930
You, human, have lived a thousand years
and are still none the wiser!

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:24.269
You should be grateful
that she didn't make her final wish.

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:26.813
If that were her final wish,

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.315
I could search for the unclaimed lamp

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.359
and take it for my own.

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:33.319
You are no spirit. What are you?

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:37.574
All of that girl's wishes
were for the sake of others.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:41.327
Her final wish must also be
a righteous one.

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:43.454
Should my plan work,

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.708
the only future Iblis faces
is annihilation.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.588
This means that he will never
be able to serve another master.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.008
So even if the owner of the lamp dies,

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.385
I cannot take it for myself?

00:02:57.468 --> 00:02:59.971
You mere half-spirit.

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:04.184
Do not dare to stir my wrath
or meddle any further in my affairs.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.937
I am Ejllael, the angel of death,
and I will be Iblis's undoing.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:12.442
This is your final warning.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:25.872
Father!

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.207
Are you okay, Father?

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.801
Is my boss okay?

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.095
She took some meds and dozed off.

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:43.264
Sade.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:45.183
I have somewhere to visit.

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:47.477
Protect the clay lump while I'm away.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:52.440
If the need arises, I'm saying
you may use your mystical powers.

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:54.692
Yes, Master.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.829
It's been a long time, Brother.

00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:51.457
I haven't seen you
since the days of the war.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.588
It seems your garden

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.091
has changed quite a bit,

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:01.926
hasn't it?

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.346
Brother, have you forgotten
how you once spoiled my flowers?

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:12.103
And do you not remember
how I stood at the front line of the war

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:13.354
while you sat back?

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.898
Come on, why are you even here?

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:21.195
Do you grow any foreign species?

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:26.200
If the wind carries
foreign seeds this way,

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:27.285
I tend to them.

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:29.370
Why do you ask?

00:05:31.372 --> 00:05:34.709
Then did a foreign seed with shaggy hair

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:38.212
fly this way from the East in 1041?

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:45.011
And when did the flower
of this seed wither away?

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:51.100
So you are here
to fill a void in your memory.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.813
What do you think happened, Iblis?

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:13.498
Khalid!

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.629
It seems your cough has worsened.
Are you okay, Khalid?

00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:24.092
You don't get sick or die, Father.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:28.971
All I am capable of doing
is weaving these unbreakable threads.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.350
Why am I such a weak being?

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:35.853
Why did you make me
such an imperfect being?

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:40.191
Humans grow sick and eventually die,

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:45.071
but that is exactly what makes them
shine so brightly while they live.

00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:48.032
I don't want to hear it!
You are a complete spiritual being,

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:53.996
yet all you can do for your dying son
is offer him a mere apple.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.380
Hey, you!

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.258
Catch him! He stole my bread!

00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:06.968
Catch the boy!

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.139
You little rat!

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:12.557
How dare you steal from me!

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.267
You little rascal!

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.603
I'll show you.
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget!

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:18.729
Stop that.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.526
He is just a hungry little boy.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.864
Unless you're going to pay,
you should stay out of it.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:40.042
Here, we can share this.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.046
Wait, boy.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:47.383
I see you have an immortal body.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.387
That is not my fault.

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:01.397
So Shadi changed their souls.

00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:19.457
Shadi must have put his sick son's soul

00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.543
into an immortal body.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:23.711
Yes, he did.

00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:27.340
And I helped him.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.596
For doing so, I was punished.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:40.144
Since that day,
no soul's seeds have blessed my garden.

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:44.190
But that foreigner's flower
is still in bloom,

00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:46.192
very much alive, as you can see.

00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:02.875
MAN FOUND DEAD AFTER TRAIL COLLAPSE
ON MOUNT CHEONGPUNG

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.426
Who are you people?

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.805
Why are you lurking outside my home?

00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:17.265
Dad?

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.183
I missed you!

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.310
I found my way home! I'm a good boy!

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:24.730
You fucking scared me, you creep.
You must be barking mad.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:27.358
Yes, I am barking. It's me, Ppoppi.

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:29.902
I'm so sorry.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.445
I lost you, Dad.

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:33.197
What?

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.160
Ha-neul! My dear baby brother, Ha-neul!

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.746
Who are you, punk?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.748
How do you know my son's name?

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:46.127
Hands off my boss, sir.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.628
Ha-neul.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.213
It's your big brother.

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:51.799
Dad. It's me, Ppoppi.

00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:56.262
That's right.

00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:57.513
Chauffeur Kim.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.974
I need to make another wish.

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:03.019
Let's go to Cheongpung Village.

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.353
Quick.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.105
Ppoppi, bang!

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:10.818
Ppoppi, "v."

00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:14.238
- Ppoppi, nose.
- Hey.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.328
Ppoppi, I missed you.

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:22.455
- Daddy. It's Ppoppi.
- Yeah?

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.374
But, Ppoppi, how did you become human?

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.544
I wished for it.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.963
I've wanted to tell you something.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:35.926
You lunatic, get away from him!

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.137
You crazy bastard…

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:46.354
Ha-neul. Just wait a short while, okay?

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:50.858
You wait too, Dad. Okay?
"That's it. Good boy."

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.986
- He's insane.
- Chauffeur Kim, start the engine.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.489
- Start the engine.
- Hurry back!

00:11:01.952 --> 00:11:03.204
ODD TEETH AND ODD PEOPLE WELCOME

00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:04.580
Wisdom teeth?

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.957
Your gums are swollen,
so we can't extract today.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.836
We'll take X-rays to check for impaction.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.881
Yes, ma'am.
I'll let you gargle before we move on.

00:11:13.964 --> 00:11:17.468
Goodness. I'm pushing 80
and growing wisdom teeth?

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.347
Will this take long?
I'm due at the food bank.

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:37.446
Wow, for such a young lady,
you sure are good in the kitchen.

00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:39.990
I only ever knew
to cook for my own family.

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.410
I'm just happy that I can help.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.705
Why, hello!

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.373
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.377
He funds the food bank. CEO Ryu Su-hyeon.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.839
This is our newest volunteer,
Ms. Lee Mi-ju.

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:57.007
I'm happy to see you.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.302
I was hoping we'd meet.

00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:03.431
What the… Why would he hope to meet me?

00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:05.558
Don't tell me…

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:10.146
Oh Pan-geum, you little minx!

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:13.816
Why would you be happy to see me?
We've never met.

00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:17.111
I don't think that's true.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.948
Humans really do cherish youth,
don't they?

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:26.495
It's not like a youthful exterior
adds years to your lifespan.

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:28.247
How foolish.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.543
Lifespan?

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.796
Wait there!

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.425
Excuse me, Mr. Ryu!

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:41.969
Why did you just say that to me?

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:48.684
Why did I say that?
Do you really want to know?

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:52.271
You've met a spirit and now an angel.
You are quite the lucky one.

00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:55.107
What do you mean by…

00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:57.485
An angel?

00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:06.035
I am the angel Ejllael,

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.370
also known as the angel of death.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.916
Of death?

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:13.959
You foolish, arrogant human.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:17.713
Did you think volunteering
would lighten the burden of your secret?

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.550
With your regained youth, did you dream
of living a long, happy life?

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.177
That dream is but a delusion.

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:25.554
What in the world

00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:27.348
do you mean?

00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:30.559
You may have gained youth,
but your remaining time is unchanged.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:34.814
Though you will go to heaven since you
lovingly took in your granddaughter.

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:36.565
You may find solace in that.

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.366
When the plum blossoms

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:49.036
next bloom in your garden…

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.039
you will die.

00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:04.802
We can't apologize enough.

00:14:05.469 --> 00:14:08.556
The entire sum that was transferred
due to a processing error

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:11.183
has been returned
to your account, Ms. Ki Ka-young.

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:15.813
Okay.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:20.985
I'm a little unwell as I fell off a cliff
recently, so I'll take my leave now.

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:24.905
- Right.
- Right?

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:27.199
What seems to be the…

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:28.909
Perhaps the amount is incorrect?

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.202
No, it's correct.

00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:32.997
I'll take this money

00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:35.082
entirely in cash.

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:39.503
The entire amount in cash?

00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:45.092
But with such large amounts,
you need to disclose the intended use.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.887
It is an especially
large amount, after all.

00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:52.933
People usually just say
it's going toward their wedding fund--

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:56.186
Sure, then it's marriage funds for me too.

00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:59.690
The entire amount. In cash.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.443
You psycho bitch!

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.486
Ms. Gu Bo-gyeong!

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.207
These jerks.

00:15:51.575 --> 00:15:53.410
I heard about your hiking accident.

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.829
As a friend, I thought I'd check in.

00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:57.331
Friend?

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:01.585
That would complicate things since
your dad and I went to college together.

00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:04.463
Or does it not matter now that he's dead?

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:07.007
So I guess you know it all now.

00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:08.467
Who I am.

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.221
I have an inkling.

00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:14.723
Is it you?

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:17.476
The first wish I made in my past life?

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:19.603
So not everything.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:26.151
It's Shaytan! It's the wrath of Iblis!

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:28.112
Khalid!

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:31.824
Khalid!

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:37.162
What on earth have you done?

00:16:38.622 --> 00:16:40.249
You're half right and half wrong.

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:42.543
You started this,
so you should end it too.

00:16:43.877 --> 00:16:45.170
Where is the lamp?

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.047
I hear you have one wish left.

00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:49.258
Would you use it for my sake?

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:53.679
I'd really like to put an end
to this tiresome immortality.

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.398
I've caught you red-handed.

00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:05.566
Pure bullshit.

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:11.739
I trust you've got my back.

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:33.469
It heals right away.

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.555
Not even a slit throat could kill you.

00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:37.890
Unfortunately.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.351
We've got you now, we have!

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:42.519
What are you-- Hey!

00:17:43.812 --> 00:17:45.105
It's a jaguar. A jaguar.

00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:49.151
He and I go back to the 11th century.
They're the ones making threats.

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:52.154
Yes, we know. We've seen them before too.

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:59.161
Now decide. Will you get caught alive?
Or caught as ghosts?

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:00.704
Either way, you will be caught.

00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:03.082
You know, all of us Korean mens

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:06.210
have a military obligation,
so we're almost killers. Of those, we…

00:18:06.293 --> 00:18:07.377
Let us retreat.

00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:17.888
See that?

00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:21.391
They're all scaredy-pants.
I could just… They're all scaredy-pants.

00:18:22.392 --> 00:18:23.227
Are you okay?

00:18:23.727 --> 00:18:25.979
They seemed off,
so we've kept an eye on them,

00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:28.190
and those jerks have been tailing you.

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:31.568
What's stranger is that every day,
another one of them disappears.

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:34.863
Someone dies in that house
every single day!

00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:38.742
- Mr. Park.
- Yeah?

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:40.494
- I have a favor to ask.
- Yeah?

00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:42.246
This may sound strange,

00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:45.374
but you have all just entered
a very strange world.

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:48.127
Like the existence of this jaguar.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.294
Yikes.

00:18:52.172 --> 00:18:53.298
I'll be fine,

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:56.718
so please watch Mi-ju,
the lady at my house, and Min-ji.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:59.596
So what you're saying is that those two

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.559
can't know what's going on,
but they also can't get caught off guard?

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:04.476
That's right.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.644
Don't you worry.

00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:06.562
Yes.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:10.357
Seeing this guy in person,
I can see he's actually quite tame.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.400
Like a pet jaguar.

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:14.778
I'm glad we could clear the air.

00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:17.281
Get him! I'm scared. Get him!

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:32.921
Long time no see, Brother.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:35.090
You have come to see me at my worst.

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:36.008
It seems so.

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:39.428
It's been a long time, my brother.

00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:42.639
Should I be worried?

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.601
Does your being here
mean my son is in danger?

00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:48.896
Perhaps.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:51.398
How I have resented

00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:53.275
the wish of your master

00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:57.487
and your reckless decision
to create an immortal body.

00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:58.405
Khalid!

00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:01.617
How I regret putting
my son's soul into that body.

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:04.411
Yes.

00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:08.040
I was, indeed, arrogant.

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:12.044
That's why I have come.
To give you a chance.

00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:17.674
Your son will never claim
her final wish as his own.

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:21.845
To be human is to make one's own choice.

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:24.014
However he may threaten her,

00:20:24.097 --> 00:20:28.227
her final wish
will most certainly be righteous.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:32.272
So you believe in your master?
That faith will cost you your life.

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:35.025
So be it.

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:38.987
I have already decided
to go to hell, Shadi.

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:43.450
So if you wish to protect your son,

00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:46.411
do not let things get that far.

00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:50.207
If your son insists
on making the wrong decision

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:52.459
and becomes my master,

00:20:53.543 --> 00:20:54.920
I will kill him.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.638
I cannot stop my son for too long.

00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:07.683
That would mean
the death of innocent children.

00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:12.354
So, he is even more evil than I.

00:21:13.522 --> 00:21:15.649
A true shaytan.

00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:19.569
I will try to hold him back
for as long as I can.

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:23.365
That is the best I can do.

00:21:25.158 --> 00:21:27.119
If that is your best, my brother,

00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:31.415
I am afraid you must worry
for your son's fate.

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:37.963
I refuse to show your son any more mercy.

00:21:54.062 --> 00:21:56.523
CLOSED TEMPORARILY
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

00:21:57.816 --> 00:21:59.359
Right, that's her there.

00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:00.694
Oh, it's her?

00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:03.488
Earlier today, I saw her
leave the bank with bags of cash.

00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:06.116
But they say she's a psycho.

00:22:06.199 --> 00:22:09.411
Is that right?
Then it makes sense for her to be rich!

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:11.621
I'm a fan of Professor Park Ji-seon.

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:15.292
She says psychopaths are more likely
to be successful than normal folk like us…

00:22:15.792 --> 00:22:16.960
This fucking bitch!

00:22:25.093 --> 00:22:27.596
Why get smacked
when we could just talk things out?

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:30.223
Hey, Miss Psycho.
Why don't we share that cash?

00:22:49.826 --> 00:22:52.120
Wait, that guy…

00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:55.207
Were those stairs always there?

00:22:55.832 --> 00:22:58.293
I'm sure they weren't there a minute ago.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.510
I left Sade with you.
Was my showing up really necessary?

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.638
He went outside to relieve himself.

00:23:10.138 --> 00:23:12.682
By the way,
I was just smacked really hard.

00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:14.309
Get your ass over here!

00:23:15.268 --> 00:23:16.395
You were smacked?

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:17.896
Wow.

00:23:18.688 --> 00:23:20.982
Now that's something I won't tolerate.

00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:28.115
- What is that?
- What was that?

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:40.710
Be right back.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.762
Hey, why are you tagging along?

00:23:58.061 --> 00:23:59.062
Please save me!

00:23:59.146 --> 00:24:01.815
I swear I'll live an honest life
from now on!

00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:03.942
What is this place?

00:24:05.485 --> 00:24:06.778
Where are we?

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.282
What is all this?

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:12.117
Where are we?

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.078
The place I fell to
when I was booted from heaven.

00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:17.080
Hell.

00:24:19.082 --> 00:24:20.208
You were here?

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.711
For how long?

00:24:24.504 --> 00:24:25.505
I'm not sure.

00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:27.549
For a time

00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:30.719
that you guys call "eternity."

00:24:33.096 --> 00:24:36.433
This is how far you'd go
to avoid bowing to humans?

00:24:37.767 --> 00:24:38.602
Even now?

00:24:40.562 --> 00:24:41.813
That would be the case.

00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:47.444
Just to be sure,
you'll take me out of here, won't you?

00:24:47.527 --> 00:24:49.446
Others barely consider me human, you know.

00:24:51.114 --> 00:24:55.243
I just want to be sure too.
About the 1,000 won you never gave me.

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:58.038
And about dinner,
the thing you frequently didn't give me.

00:24:58.121 --> 00:24:59.581
And about the straw cutter.

00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:02.667
That time you didn't fetch
the hand straw cutter, but the huge--

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.630
I'm treating you with care.
My dear Genie is warm--

00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:09.549
Whoa, hold up there.

00:25:10.383 --> 00:25:11.968
And I am refusing.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:16.681
I guess this is just…

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:21.186
how it is between us. Come here.

00:25:23.772 --> 00:25:24.773
Get over here.

00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:33.490
Why are you so late?
I told you to fly over!

00:25:33.573 --> 00:25:37.869
Where would I get a velvet hanger
at this hour? I was lucky Irem had one.

00:25:37.953 --> 00:25:39.579
What do you even need this for?

00:25:39.663 --> 00:25:42.666
From now on,
you and I need to work together.

00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:45.085
Now.

00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:48.129
Pull it very carefully from top to bottom.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:51.091
We can't let a single speck of dust
fall off this.

00:25:51.174 --> 00:25:54.553
Hell's dust, air, vibe,
saturation, and brightness.

00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:57.430
Every molecule and atom,
memory, and recollection.

00:25:57.514 --> 00:25:59.182
Dust from hell?

00:26:02.686 --> 00:26:06.022
You seem upbeat,
considering you just took a trip to hell.

00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:09.818
I avoided every one of her shots today.
She didn't land a single one.

00:26:10.318 --> 00:26:13.863
I guess I've just worked out your pattern.
Right, left, left, center.

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:17.158
Not likely.

00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:19.202
Hang it up over there.

00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:21.621
Okay.

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:25.792
The immortal being was that kid.
My upperclassman's son.

00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:28.795
He came to see me at the auto shop.

00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:32.340
You're half right and half wrong.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.552
He said that too.

00:26:35.635 --> 00:26:37.596
Why am I only ever half right?

00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:39.264
What is right, and what is wrong?

00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:43.268
Shadi switched the souls of his son
and the immortal being.

00:26:44.477 --> 00:26:48.231
The boy you hoped would live a long life
never got to do so.

00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:51.109
The immortal being…

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:53.945
is Khalid.

00:26:55.238 --> 00:26:56.573
Khalid.

00:26:57.449 --> 00:26:58.950
The one I saw in the hourglass?

00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:03.371
That brat. I was nice to him,
and this is how he treats me?

00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:06.499
Mr. Genie!

00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:09.002
Mr. Genie!

00:27:10.503 --> 00:27:11.921
I found my dad.

00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:15.050
I was so excited to see
my baby brother Ha-neul again!

00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:17.135
Are you

00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:18.470
Kim Gae?

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.224
You really do look like Daniel Henney.

00:27:25.935 --> 00:27:27.228
Down boy.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:31.524
Force of habit.

00:27:32.776 --> 00:27:33.985
Mr. Genie.

00:27:34.069 --> 00:27:37.530
Please turn me back into a dog.

00:27:43.912 --> 00:27:44.871
Boss!

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:46.790
What's wrong?

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.583
Are you ill in some way?

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:50.669
Let's get you to a hospital now.

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:56.925
Every time I go to the hospital,
I feel sleepy.

00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:58.802
"How will we pay for the surgery?"

00:27:59.302 --> 00:28:00.553
Dad gets angry.

00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:01.721
Ppoppi.

00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:06.935
Let me at least wipe the blood.

00:28:08.478 --> 00:28:11.981
Why do you keep seeing yourself as a dog?

00:28:12.065 --> 00:28:15.485
In my life, I've met a lot of people
who were absolute dogs.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.406
But you're a really good man.

00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:20.740
Chauffeur Kim.

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:23.910
Thank you so much for everything.

00:28:24.494 --> 00:28:28.081
You can have all of my money.
I don't need it anymore.

00:28:29.457 --> 00:28:31.376
Mr. Genie, please hurry.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.253
That's truly your final wish?

00:28:34.838 --> 00:28:36.756
Why not go ask while you're still human?

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.843
If they've lost a dog,
if they're looking for one, if they even…

00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:42.887
want to find it.

00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:44.305
None of that

00:28:45.181 --> 00:28:46.141
matters anymore.

00:28:47.183 --> 00:28:50.270
I need to say goodbye
to Ha-neul as Ppoppi.

00:28:50.353 --> 00:28:51.396
Boss.

00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:53.064
So I have to go.

00:28:54.023 --> 00:28:56.818
This… is my final wish.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.322
This is so screwed up.

00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:16.880
It's been fulfilled.

00:29:57.587 --> 00:29:58.797
She got to the terminal,

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.966
didn't get on a bus,
but went out and got into a taxi?

00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:04.928
Why is that?

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:08.890
If that kid is Khalid,

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:11.976
then can't you just go to that time
and see what happened?

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.937
I've already tried.

00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:16.981
But I can't go
to that specific period of time.

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:18.107
Why not?

00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:19.984
I think he's hiding it from me.

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:23.988
He had also been granting me three wishes.

00:30:25.114 --> 00:30:26.699
Your connections are just, wow.

00:30:28.201 --> 00:30:29.994
So? What did you wish for?

00:30:30.078 --> 00:30:31.830
My first wish

00:30:32.372 --> 00:30:35.375
was to be able to send humans to hell
with three wishes.

00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:37.335
The second

00:30:37.418 --> 00:30:41.464
was to release me from the lamp
so I may meet and corrupt a new master.

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:44.050
So you have one wish left?

00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:47.512
That's what I thought too.

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:51.558
But…

00:30:53.935 --> 00:30:56.145
I think I've already made

00:30:57.564 --> 00:30:59.190
all three of my wishes.

00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:04.696
I have another question.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.616
Back in 1041,

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.704
another foreign seed
would have flown this way.

00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:14.956
You're right.

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:21.588
It was a rather striking flower
from the East.

00:31:22.422 --> 00:31:26.801
At first, it was wilted
and on the verge of dying.

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:31.973
But it sprang back to life
and bloomed for 28 years before fading.

00:31:34.642 --> 00:31:36.895
Not eight years?

00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:38.021
No.

00:31:39.022 --> 00:31:40.982
It bloomed for another 20 years.

00:31:43.526 --> 00:31:46.988
That flower was in full bloom
in the wasteland of your memory.

00:31:52.452 --> 00:31:54.704
I'm not sure what I wished for…

00:31:58.333 --> 00:31:59.500
but I think…

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:04.756
it led to a very grim end.

00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:12.430
So I'm scared.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.062
I know how it feels to be scared now.

00:32:20.229 --> 00:32:23.524
When I was falling off the cliff,
I thought of Grandma, Min-ji…

00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:26.778
and you.

00:32:27.737 --> 00:32:29.906
The thought of never
seeing any of you again

00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:34.285
seriously pissed me off.
That's being scared, isn't it?

00:32:36.663 --> 00:32:37.664
You're not far off.

00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:44.003
So I've climbed pretty high up the ranks.
I beat out the auto shop and even frogs.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.507
It was really tough with the frogs.

00:32:52.762 --> 00:32:55.640
It seems like you also need
one of those places right now.

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:59.852
A place like rooftops are to me.

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:01.980
Got one?

00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:09.529
This is last spring.

00:33:11.572 --> 00:33:13.241
This is that kind of place for you?

00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:19.122
Is this when the bats, snakes,
cockroaches, and the like come out?

00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:21.666
Stop that. I get squeamish.

00:33:21.749 --> 00:33:23.751
Sea louse, woodlouse.

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:25.628
I said stop it.

00:33:26.212 --> 00:33:28.297
Do you think that fits
the reason we're here?

00:33:29.298 --> 00:33:30.216
That's too bad.

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.844
I know a ton of disgusting things.

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:36.222
Why do you like it here anyway?

00:33:39.225 --> 00:33:40.560
It was just so pretty.

00:33:42.979 --> 00:33:44.897
I'd lived such a long life,

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:47.734
never seeing cherry blossoms.

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:54.157
At the time, I remember wanting
to see them with you.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.324
At the time?

00:33:56.826 --> 00:33:58.578
But that time was during the festival.

00:33:59.078 --> 00:34:01.873
Wasn't that the time
when you were trying your hardest

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:03.624
to kill me?

00:34:06.627 --> 00:34:09.380
I stopped trying my hardest.

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:11.340
From that moment on.

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:17.305
If I had tried my hardest,

00:34:17.805 --> 00:34:19.223
you'd be dead.

00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:36.616
So it was from that moment on.

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:39.494
When the flowers withered,

00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:42.997
you grew uneasy
at the thought of me dying.

00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:55.426
And here I was, thinking I was first.

00:35:08.147 --> 00:35:09.190
How pretty.

00:35:31.254 --> 00:35:34.382
Is that true?
The immortal one visited Ki Ka-young?

00:35:35.716 --> 00:35:38.344
YES. HE WENT PERSONALLY
TO THE AUTO SHOP

00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:41.931
That bumbling idiot!

00:35:43.432 --> 00:35:45.977
I overestimated the patience of humans.

00:35:47.895 --> 00:35:48.813
Wait, no.

00:35:48.896 --> 00:35:51.315
At the rate he's going,
I should be using him.

00:35:52.108 --> 00:35:53.693
Is the lamp the only way?

00:35:55.486 --> 00:35:58.114
COULD YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT FOR ME?

00:35:58.197 --> 00:35:59.574
I COULDN'T READ YOUR LIPS

00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:00.908
Come on.

00:36:05.788 --> 00:36:07.456
Have you thought about what you did?

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.875
Will you do it again?

00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:28.311
When the plum blossoms
next bloom in your garden,

00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:30.229
you will die.

00:36:39.405 --> 00:36:41.032
Why isn't she coming?

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:42.909
- Ms. Yoo?
- Yes?

00:36:43.409 --> 00:36:46.913
Could you send me Lee Mi-ju…
I mean, Ms. Ki Ka-young's X-rays?

00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:47.830
Sure.

00:36:49.123 --> 00:36:52.710
By the way, why are you treating her
under Ms. Ki Ka-young's name?

00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:55.338
Because I own this dental clinic.

00:36:56.214 --> 00:36:57.048
Right.

00:36:57.632 --> 00:36:58.925
The file is with you now.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.512
KI KA-YOUNG

00:37:08.976 --> 00:37:11.062
OH PAN-GEUM

00:37:15.524 --> 00:37:17.401
KI KA-YOUNG
OH PAN-GEUM

00:37:19.987 --> 00:37:22.531
OH PAN-GEUM

00:37:24.784 --> 00:37:27.620
KI KA-YOUNG
OH PAN-GEUM

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:37.213
Buy ten kilos of sun-dried salt.
I'm going to mix the soybean paste.

00:37:47.807 --> 00:37:49.100
What are you doing here?

00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:50.977
It's you, Ka-young.

00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:53.729
You see that vest?

00:37:57.817 --> 00:37:58.693
Vest?

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:02.363
Ka-young. I can't tell anyone else,

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:04.824
but you've always been a little strange.

00:38:05.324 --> 00:38:07.493
The thing is…

00:38:07.576 --> 00:38:09.328
My daughter-in-law…

00:38:09.412 --> 00:38:11.580
Well, ex-daughter-in-law
since they're divorced.

00:38:11.664 --> 00:38:17.003
I hear she drinks her days away, hung up
on being fired after 20 years as manager.

00:38:18.254 --> 00:38:21.841
But I can't shake the image
of her always worn out,

00:38:22.758 --> 00:38:24.969
thinking a bottle of face cream
was a luxury,

00:38:25.052 --> 00:38:26.887
standing there in that vest.

00:38:30.516 --> 00:38:31.350
Mother!

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:33.060
Mother!

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:34.729
"Mother"!

00:38:35.604 --> 00:38:37.481
I could swear she once called out to me.

00:38:39.358 --> 00:38:41.485
I have no clue what this is.

00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:43.779
Maybe I'm getting dementia.

00:38:47.783 --> 00:38:49.785
You spirits or angels or whatever.

00:38:50.453 --> 00:38:52.621
You all pretend to be so mighty,

00:38:52.705 --> 00:38:54.123
but just look at Granny An.

00:38:54.623 --> 00:38:55.458
She's still

00:38:55.541 --> 00:38:59.920
holding on to a fragment of the memories
you erased with your magic.

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:05.092
That doesn't change a thing.

00:39:05.926 --> 00:39:07.511
It only adds to the suffering.

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:10.848
Well…

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.518
I guess we'll just suffer, then.

00:39:22.735 --> 00:39:26.155
By the way,
why did you scribble all over your lamp?

00:39:26.238 --> 00:39:27.448
Were you badmouthing me?

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.409
Scribble? In the lamp?

00:39:32.286 --> 00:39:33.579
I did nothing of the sort.

00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:40.044
What are you saying is here? Where?

00:39:41.295 --> 00:39:42.505
What do you mean?

00:39:43.005 --> 00:39:47.885
There are a whole lot of Arabic letters
all over the walls and floor here!

00:39:49.553 --> 00:39:51.222
You really can't see this?

00:39:51.972 --> 00:39:53.015
Never mind. Move.

00:40:28.509 --> 00:40:31.512
So you're saying this is written
here in my lamp?

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:35.307
See? It's there, right?

00:40:35.808 --> 00:40:38.144
If you can read it, go ahead.
What does it say?

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:44.400
"You, who came from Goryeo,
were living as a slave."

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.444
"Serves you right."

00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:47.361
See? It's there…

00:40:48.988 --> 00:40:51.782
So you were badmouthing me.
Trying to die, are we?

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.828
Here. What does this say?

00:40:59.248 --> 00:41:04.295
"Who in their right mind would sell
date palms if they don't make any money?"

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:08.174
What a load of shi… sheer brilliance.

00:41:08.257 --> 00:41:11.177
Go on. Keep reading.
I'll deal with you later.

00:41:20.853 --> 00:41:24.773
"Even though I told you I'm a genie,
you keep wishing on stars…"

00:41:28.569 --> 00:41:32.072
"No matter how much I tell you,
you wish on silly stars."

00:41:32.698 --> 00:41:35.868
"But you keep wishing for me to do well."

00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:40.456
"You must really think
I'm a poor peddler."

00:41:45.377 --> 00:41:46.670
What is all this?

00:41:48.756 --> 00:41:50.007
It's quite detailed.

00:41:51.425 --> 00:41:53.219
Do you think this might be it?

00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:56.722
A fragment of our memories?

00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:06.649
All right. The two of us have lost
some memories from our past lives.

00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:08.734
Who wants to help us find them?

00:42:08.817 --> 00:42:10.861
I don't have any memories.

00:42:10.945 --> 00:42:12.655
I don't have my master's permission.

00:42:13.155 --> 00:42:14.573
I have no intention of helping.

00:42:16.742 --> 00:42:20.579
Fine. Do you or do you not know
that Ejllael is hiding something?

00:42:20.663 --> 00:42:23.624
- I don't have any memories.
- I have no intention of helping.

00:42:28.504 --> 00:42:29.380
Irem.

00:42:31.423 --> 00:42:32.550
Just a moment.

00:42:39.181 --> 00:42:40.599
Irem!

00:42:44.019 --> 00:42:45.396
You're one tough cookie.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.400
Have you ever seen
the two of us together in the past?

00:42:49.483 --> 00:42:51.485
Blink once if you have.

00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:53.529
Just a moment.

00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:58.075
Master, isn't this too much?

00:42:58.158 --> 00:43:01.245
Must you do this to my love
for the sake of yours?

00:43:02.246 --> 00:43:03.831
Irem!

00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:08.252
Hey, open up.
We need to put this back, Irem.

00:43:08.335 --> 00:43:09.336
Here's an easy one.

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:13.924
Did Genie and Jinniya kiss,
or did they not?

00:43:14.008 --> 00:43:16.010
Did he or did he not have a mouth?

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.846
- I can answer that--
- Irem's out due to injuries.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.807
You and me, one on one,
with him on the line.

00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:25.936
I have plans.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:33.277
So you tend to use plans as an excuse.

00:43:33.902 --> 00:43:34.737
Master!

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:39.033
Irem, watch out for your wings!

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:41.410
You're a national treasure!

00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:45.664
Irem!

00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:52.838
I guess we've learned one thing.
"We have a hidden past."

00:43:54.214 --> 00:43:57.551
"You kissed her." We've learned that too.

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.305
I don't think that's true.

00:44:06.935 --> 00:44:07.936
It's Eom Sang-tae.

00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:13.442
Will he really go to the past?

00:44:13.525 --> 00:44:17.112
Even if he does,
past you wouldn't know the situation.

00:44:17.946 --> 00:44:19.448
Would you even get involved?

00:44:20.699 --> 00:44:21.700
100%.

00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:27.373
I'll probably bring the baseball bat
that's beside my wardrobe.

00:44:27.456 --> 00:44:28.749
I know myself.

00:44:29.249 --> 00:44:31.168
I'll definitely try to save that girl.

00:44:31.752 --> 00:44:33.545
- But this wish is just so…
- I know.

00:44:33.629 --> 00:44:35.297
Once again, I'll lose.

00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:38.509
And if I lose,
dying is part of my first wish.

00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:42.221
But I'll still do it.
I will make good decisions.

00:44:42.304 --> 00:44:44.723
I may have been born bad,
but I can still do that.

00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:47.726
If we're going to

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.813
die anyway, might as well make it fun.

00:44:52.481 --> 00:44:54.274
So go and protect me.

00:44:55.067 --> 00:44:56.860
If I am to die, make sure it's for you.

00:44:57.695 --> 00:45:00.948
And if you are to die,
you should die for me too.

00:45:05.285 --> 00:45:06.203
All right.

00:45:07.162 --> 00:45:08.163
I'll do that.

00:45:10.165 --> 00:45:11.166
Let's do that.

00:45:18.132 --> 00:45:19.967
To right before you killed that girl?

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.176
Isn't it obvious?

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.138
It's a chance to feel that rush again.
Why would I waste it?

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:28.934
This time, I won't smash her
into my taillight or dye her hair.

00:45:29.518 --> 00:45:32.730
Then they won't be able to link it
to the case from 20 years ago.

00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:37.025
But this time,

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.738
I'm thinking of chopping her into parts.

00:45:41.321 --> 00:45:44.116
So, that's your plan?

00:45:45.534 --> 00:45:47.828
If that's how it is,
maybe I should shift gears.

00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:48.871
Do it.

00:45:48.954 --> 00:45:50.372
Do whatever it takes.

00:45:50.456 --> 00:45:52.207
You're my genie, after all.

00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:56.086
April 10, nighttime.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:58.881
At 9:10. That's p.m., okay?

00:45:59.673 --> 00:46:01.508
In front of the Gangma Falls sign. Got it?

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:02.509
GANGMA FALLS, 500M

00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:05.888
100%.

00:46:07.097 --> 00:46:08.474
It's been fulfilled.

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:12.519
{\an8}What was your CSAT score?

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:14.146
{\an8}APRIL 10, 2024

00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:20.778
- Your grandma is fuming.
- Why?

00:46:20.861 --> 00:46:21.987
Something about you

00:46:23.405 --> 00:46:24.990
doing two things at the same time.

00:46:25.073 --> 00:46:26.283
Don't ever do that again.

00:46:28.535 --> 00:46:30.370
Also, I'm here from the future.

00:46:31.205 --> 00:46:33.332
You're here from the Middle East.
Get lost.

00:46:34.082 --> 00:46:35.501
It's true.

00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:38.962
And this is a favor
your future self asked of you.

00:46:47.054 --> 00:46:49.598
WRITTEN BY KI KA-YOUNG
A NEGATIVE ONE AND A STONE…

00:46:59.358 --> 00:47:01.443
EOM SANG-TAE IS THE MURDERER
HE WILL KILL AGAIN

00:47:01.527 --> 00:47:04.446
20-YEAR-OLD CORPSE
FOUND IN CHEONGPUNG VILLAGE

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:11.328
HIS SIGNATURE SEEMS TO BE
DYEING HIS VICTIMS' HAIR BLACK

00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:14.581
SHE WILL GO MISSING TONIGHT
(APRIL 10, 2024) AROUND 9 P.M.

00:47:18.043 --> 00:47:20.128
I knew this bastard would do this.

00:47:24.299 --> 00:47:25.259
You were right.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.594
You'd be late going that way.

00:47:31.056 --> 00:47:32.224
Hold on tight.

00:47:58.417 --> 00:48:00.252
I could swear I've been here before.

00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:06.884
Right, April.

00:48:08.218 --> 00:48:09.553
Mr. Eom.

00:48:13.098 --> 00:48:15.434
What the hell?

00:48:16.476 --> 00:48:17.477
I definitely remember…

00:48:18.145 --> 00:48:19.855
I'm so sorry.

00:48:19.938 --> 00:48:23.525
I just realized I left my phone behind
at the bus terminal.

00:48:23.609 --> 00:48:24.610
Your phone?

00:48:32.784 --> 00:48:34.828
I must've just imagined it.

00:48:37.456 --> 00:48:39.708
Yes, that's right. Your cell phone.

00:48:39.791 --> 00:48:41.793
- Please come this way.
- Thanks.

00:48:43.795 --> 00:48:44.838
I must say…

00:48:47.633 --> 00:48:50.719
the more I look at it,
the blonder it seems.

00:48:50.802 --> 00:48:52.095
Your hair, I mean.

00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:54.056
Sorry?

00:49:07.194 --> 00:49:08.820
Where are you going?

00:49:08.904 --> 00:49:10.697
Come here, you fucking bitch!

00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:18.747
Fuck.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.666
Man, I should reflect on my actions.

00:49:20.749 --> 00:49:25.045
He even bought a chainsaw, but I left
his body behind and just brought his soul.

00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:28.131
Ms. Ki.

00:49:29.424 --> 00:49:30.634
Why are you doing this?

00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:34.012
- There must be a misunderstanding.
- Misunderstanding?

00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:38.517
Shut up, you fucking murderer.

00:49:39.893 --> 00:49:41.019
Is this blood?

00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:44.231
You damn bitch. Why are you doing this?

00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:45.148
Why, that little…

00:49:45.232 --> 00:49:47.484
Get over here. I'll kill you too.

00:49:47.567 --> 00:49:50.112
Just cut the crap. You can't beat me.

00:49:51.071 --> 00:49:53.448
I'm having too much fun right now.

00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:57.411
Gosh, that's gotta hurt.

00:49:58.245 --> 00:50:00.247
Ouch, his elbows! Damn!

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:04.501
Sir, could you please call the police?
What should we do?

00:50:04.584 --> 00:50:08.338
I've already called the police.
112 and I go way back, you see.

00:50:14.386 --> 00:50:15.637
That's it!

00:50:24.479 --> 00:50:25.981
Just now, that evil man

00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:28.108
tried to kill this lady here.

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:30.485
He smashed her head
against the tail light here.

00:50:30.986 --> 00:50:35.574
You can see her hair here.
And this woman here hit that man…

00:50:36.742 --> 00:50:37.909
Let's skip that part.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.622
And I have a feeling that some YouTubers
will soon uncover a 20-year-old corpse.

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:45.250
I suggest you search that man's house.

00:50:45.333 --> 00:50:47.169
Especially the basement.

00:50:47.794 --> 00:50:49.087
How do you know…

00:50:50.172 --> 00:50:53.216
Who are you?
Were you the witness back then?

00:50:54.342 --> 00:50:57.763
It wasn't me, but I think
it might have been your mother.

00:50:58.263 --> 00:51:00.682
I also recommend you look into her.

00:51:00.766 --> 00:51:01.892
Okay, sure.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.894
Pardon?

00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:12.986
Was 112 always such a friendly place?

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.072
They even offered me coffee.

00:51:15.822 --> 00:51:17.407
You causing trouble in the future?

00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:18.825
Here.

00:51:20.494 --> 00:51:22.871
I can't believe
that jerk and I are of the same kind.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.414
No.

00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:26.541
He's different from you.

00:51:26.625 --> 00:51:27.959
That punk is just a murderer.

00:51:29.503 --> 00:51:31.922
You're taking my side? Hold up.

00:51:32.672 --> 00:51:34.633
Have we grown very close in the future?

00:51:35.175 --> 00:51:36.635
So I guess you've kept me alive.

00:51:36.718 --> 00:51:38.178
Excuse me.

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:43.308
Thank you for saving me.

00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:47.229
I would have died if it weren't for you.

00:51:48.146 --> 00:51:49.773
But I'm a psychopath, you know.

00:51:49.856 --> 00:51:50.857
Sorry?

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.235
Right.

00:51:54.569 --> 00:51:57.364
Then you're the psychopath
who came to save my life.

00:51:57.948 --> 00:51:59.908
I'll be thankful for the rest of my life.

00:52:01.034 --> 00:52:03.787
Well, I should get back to the station.

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:07.999
Thank you. Thank you so much!

00:52:12.003 --> 00:52:14.673
Hey, I've never heard that before.

00:52:15.173 --> 00:52:16.216
Someone thanking me.

00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:21.096
Wow, here and in the future too.

00:52:21.179 --> 00:52:25.725
All sorts of strange things happen when
I'm with you. You are an odd little star.

00:52:27.602 --> 00:52:28.436
Star?

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.356
Yes. You're the strangest
oddball of a star…

00:52:32.065 --> 00:52:33.066
Hold up.

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:35.318
Hey.

00:52:36.862 --> 00:52:38.780
No. That's not what I meant.

00:52:38.864 --> 00:52:39.698
One moment.

00:52:45.203 --> 00:52:48.039
Hey, Min-ji. It's me. This girl
almost got her head bashed in,

00:52:48.123 --> 00:52:50.876
but now this guy is suddenly
talking about stars.

00:52:51.918 --> 00:52:53.628
That's right. He's not human.

00:52:54.212 --> 00:52:55.380
He's actually not human.

00:52:57.299 --> 00:52:58.133
No.

00:52:58.758 --> 00:53:00.135
Yeah, you're right.

00:53:00.802 --> 00:53:02.429
Right, this is what you were like.

00:53:02.929 --> 00:53:05.724
Wait, I'm not saying you're wrong…

00:53:06.933 --> 00:53:07.976
Ki Ka-young.

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:11.938
I should get back to where you are.

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:13.982
No, I'm not taking his side.

00:53:14.649 --> 00:53:16.193
Seeing you like this,

00:53:17.235 --> 00:53:19.029
I really miss you.

00:53:27.996 --> 00:53:28.997
No.

00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:31.458
It wasn't even raining.

00:53:31.958 --> 00:53:33.001
Damn it.

00:53:44.137 --> 00:53:46.681
You're sleeping after branding
an innocent genie a perv?

00:54:10.205 --> 00:54:12.123
And you still fall for things like this?

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:14.417
Right, well,

00:54:15.794 --> 00:54:18.463
the past version of me, you know…

00:54:32.394 --> 00:54:33.561
I promise.

00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:38.316
That flower was in full bloom
in the wasteland of your memory.

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.277
I will find my memories.

00:54:42.529 --> 00:54:43.363
Of what?

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.907
You.

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:48.243
In my lamp…

00:54:50.036 --> 00:54:52.038
out of all the words you traced over,

00:54:53.039 --> 00:54:54.624
the most common word…

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:07.012
is habibti.

00:55:08.596 --> 00:55:10.890
What does that mean?

00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:15.854
My love.

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:24.394

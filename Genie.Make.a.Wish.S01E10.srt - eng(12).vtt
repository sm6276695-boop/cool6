GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.461
PLEASE RETURN YOUR ID
AND YOUR LOCKER AND BUILDING KEYS

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:29.297
Gu Bo-gyeong, I'm holding you
responsible for this. You're fired!

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.800
What will you do
about our branch's average balance?

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:38.014
Fuck!

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:40.391
A genie?

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:42.060
That's nonsense.

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:44.604
Our channel went viral
because you found that corpse.

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:48.274
Yeah, and the genie is the one
who helped me find the corpse.

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:49.484
I'm being serious!

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:53.196
Otherwise, how could I possibly
have found that corpse?

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:55.698
You have to believe me.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.577
We only have two chances left, Da-jin.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:00.745
We're both SKY grads.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.458
We need to rack our brains and figure out
how to turn our lives around, okay?

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:17.804
If it's a wish, could we wish
to inherit a conglomerate fortune?

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:21.182
Why inherit it? We could
just become the conglomerates.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.520
Hold up. How much
is the richest person in Korea worth?

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.523
Do we really need that much?
It's not like we're building an empire.

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:30.108
Say we have two kids.

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:33.069
If we fund their studies abroad
and a home for when they marry,

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.280
that's billions already.
What about retirement?

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:37.782
You're right. You can never have too much.

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.285
But are you sure there are no conditions?

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:43.121
In any fables with spirits,

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:45.915
the moral is always
"what goes around comes around."

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.919
"Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered."
What if there's a price?

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.299
- It would be nice if we could ask.
- Hey!

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:57.177
What if the genie answers
and counts it as a wish?

00:02:58.553 --> 00:02:59.637
You're right.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.851
Then how about
we think about it separately

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:06.978
and each get to use one wish?

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:08.021
What?

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:10.982
But… why would I do that?

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:14.611
I wouldn't have told you
if we were going to do that.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.031
We're a married couple,
so isn't it a given?

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.825
We can make money,
but some things money can't buy.

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:23.536
What are you thinking about?

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.623
Wishing for Dad to be cancer-free.

00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:30.043
Come on, we have modern medicine.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.296
Why would you wish
for something like that?

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.797
Money would solve everything.

00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:37.383
My dad has terminal liver cancer.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.344
Terminal means there's no hope.

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:42.222
Come on, it's not like
he's on his deathbed or anything.

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:43.890
Check out our views.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.727
We'll be generating income in no time,
so let's just wait three months.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.812
We'll just save the wish for now, okay?

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.105
Hey, Ko Yeong-hyeon.

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:53.358
Fuck you!

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:27.684
Khalid!

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:29.394
Khalid!

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:34.941
I saw Iblis!
I saw him bringing humans to ruin.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.528
It was truly a sight to behold, Father.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.446
Tell me what you did.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.572
Did you hurt the girl?

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:46.286
I feel no pain in this body,
nor do I feel out of breath.

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:49.664
But I do not have power like Iblis.

00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:51.416
I have lost my ability to weave,

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:55.920
so what am I to do now
with this immortal body?

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:12.520
The end is nigh!

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.189
You foolish humans!

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.277
Judgment day is approaching!

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.281
Angels from the sky alert us!
Heed me when I say…

00:05:23.364 --> 00:05:26.326
I'll let it slide today.
I have a lot on my mind.

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:30.413
Then you shall all be saved.

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:47.638
You said I stole a feather of yours
before I was locked up.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.267
Again with your damn feather talk.
I don't know about it.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.644
Well, I do. I know what I did with it.

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:56.064
I wrote some things.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:58.733
On the floors and columns,
all over my lamp.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.780
You figured that out?

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.366
Yes, but I'm not sure
when I could have done it.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:08.242
Nor do I remember.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.372
So please

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.624
make sure we are punished.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:16.709
You and I both.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.295
That final wish Ki Ka-young made

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:21.506
was fulfilled.

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:23.007
Right?

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:27.011
He brought Ki Ka-young back to life
to carry out that final wish,

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:30.932
and I was reunited
with the reincarnated Ki Ka-young.

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:31.849
Am I wrong?

00:06:33.684 --> 00:06:35.686
If my fury was enough to level a city…

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:42.151
HABIBTI

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.986
…it must mean I had lost a loved one.

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:45.613
I'd lost Ki Ka-young.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.450
I must have loved her.

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:51.911
- Isn't that right?
- So what?

00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:54.539
Are we playing bingo? What's your point?

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:55.998
About Ki Ka-young's lifespan.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.167
You must be mad.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.585
How much is left?

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:00.837
I beg you.

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:03.714
Tell me so I can prepare.

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.091
All because of a lowly human!

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.886
Have you learned nothing
from Shadi's fate?

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.096
Of course not.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:15.351
Why else would I be doing everything I can
not to kill the immortal one?

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.105
Shadi loves that boy enough
to die for him,

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:21.732
and because he loves him,

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.819
the pain cuts deep.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.991
You arrogant shaytan.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:33.995
If you're so curious, pluck out my eyes
to see for yourself. Go ahead.

00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:37.665
I wonder why he keeps
forgiving a bastard like you.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:50.136
Who shall stand in the day of judgment?

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:53.306
Who will walk the path to salvation?

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:16.871
I was gathering intel on the immortal one.

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:20.583
I sensed that your intentions
were aligned with the immortal one.

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:24.837
The half-spirit is clawing his way up,
not knowing his place,

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:28.466
while Iblis and Ki Ka-young are edging
closer to the truth of their past lives.

00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:32.303
And now, even my mythical beast
is totally missing the mark?

00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:34.096
What now, Irem?

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:37.850
If you could just…
point me in the right direction--

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:39.560
What do you think I'm doing now?

00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:42.939
Listen carefully.

00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:45.650
No, wait. You can't hear, can you?

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:49.237
Watch carefully.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:55.618
The half-spirit will use Shadi
and plunge the world into sleep once more.

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:59.038
When that day comes,
there is something you must do.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.207
That's all you need to do.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:03.668
Am I understood?

00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:09.090
Yes, Master.

00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:17.682
These brats.

00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:20.685
ELDEST

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:26.899
Hey, I've brought over some side dishes,
but your door won't seem to open.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.402
I must be entering the wrong code.

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:33.114
I told you not to come.
You know my wife's gone on a cruise.

00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:35.908
That's why I cooked you food.
I'll just pop it inside--

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.493
Just leave it at the door.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.204
My wife doesn't want anyone
who's not family in the house.

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:42.415
You rotten bastard!
Aren't I family to you?

00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:44.834
Am I a stranger? Am I?

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:46.210
You little…

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.172
Stop eating and get peeling.

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:56.596
You're back early
from visiting your son, the judge.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:57.888
Yes.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:01.559
He kept asking me to stay over,
saying he'd send me on a cruise,

00:10:01.642 --> 00:10:04.145
but I couldn't be bothered,
so I just came back.

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:07.023
How lucky you are.

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:11.611
What is this?

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:14.697
OH PAN-GEUM

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.200
I think I'll be going farther away
than Hawaii.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.328
Please take good care of my Ka-young.

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:21.579
Where's she off to now?

00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:24.373
Her daughter must be
treating her incredibly well.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:27.293
If it's farther away than Hawaii,
how nice must it be?

00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:31.130
What's so great about being flown around
at a ripe old age? What a bother!

00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:34.967
Hawaii? That old place?
I could go tomorrow if I wanted to.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:40.264
My eldest son is a judge, and my youngest
is an executive at a major conglomerate.

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:42.808
And my grandchildren are all geniuses.

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.060
Just look at Ok-nam.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:48.481
She abandoned her entire life
and ran away because of her child.

00:10:49.106 --> 00:10:52.276
If anyone thinks they did a better job
at raising their kids than me,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.611
come on out, I say!

00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:56.572
Of course. Right you are!

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:59.742
We all know. We all do.

00:11:01.118 --> 00:11:02.453
AN BOK-JA

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.251
Don't worry about Ka-young,
and send us some photos of the nice place.

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.463
I wonder where Ok-nam has gotten to.

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:16.008
She even changed her number.

00:11:19.303 --> 00:11:22.431
- What is that smell? Is it chicken soup?
- Yes.

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:25.309
Tell that tall fellow to come too.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:32.566
I hope you'll continue to get along
with my dear Ka-young.

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:35.736
Don't fight, and you mustn't leave her.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.948
If she acts all prickly,
just be gentle with her.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:46.956
- The drumsticks are always mine.
- Goodness me.

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.792
Just play nice and share.

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:52.503
What's yours is his, even a bean.

00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:56.882
For better or worse,
until death do you part.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.176
Then give him beans.
The drumsticks are mine.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.428
You brat!

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:03.472
Just let him have one today!
I'm doing all of this for a reason.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.891
What reason?
The drumsticks are mine, so why?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.102
Don't you dare touch my…

00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:13.315
Come here.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:18.487
You come here.

00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:21.031
- I said to come here.
- I said no.

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:24.034
Do you want to die?

00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:27.747
- I'd rather not.
- Don't talk back!

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.123
Don't ask questions!

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.209
- I said not to talk back.
- I said not to ask questions!

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:33.377
Stop copying me!

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.672
This level of chemistry
is good enough for me.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:37.923
Get over here!

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:55.775
Seeing as this word comes up the most,

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:58.319
is this habibti? "My love"?

00:12:58.402 --> 00:13:01.155
What? Right, yes. It is.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.699
You don't even remember, but this is me?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.495
There's a 50-50 chance it's me or Jinniya.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:12.458
Shouldn't you have cleared up
those doubts before we kissed?

00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:16.170
If this happens to be Jinniya,

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:20.007
you will die for exploiting my hard labor.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.510
So hurry and find your memories.

00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:25.054
I've found one.

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:30.684
It says, "Every night you make a garment
to wear when you return to Goryeo."

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:33.354
A garment?

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.358
I guess I must have liked
needles back then too.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:41.195
Where is Khalid's name?

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:43.906
Here and here.

00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:45.741
Why?

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:49.036
Because, in Korea,
it's unlucky to write names in red.

00:13:50.037 --> 00:13:50.871
This brat.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:56.043
If this is when he started preparing,
then we're losing on all fronts.

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:00.965
We're completely winning at one thing.

00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:05.261
No matter how much information Khalid has,
you'll be the one making the wish.

00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:08.931
Let's get out of here.

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:11.767
From now on,
you and the lamp are inseparable.

00:14:13.894 --> 00:14:15.646
You want me to carry it around?

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:18.148
Like a portable

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:19.650
curry pot.

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:21.569
That's believable, right?

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:23.362
That's why…

00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:26.323
Here.

00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:30.160
I saw people carrying these things around.

00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:32.580
Not bad at adapting.

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:39.461
I wonder how much time we have left.

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:46.719
On that note,
listen carefully to what I say now.

00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:51.181
I'm sure Khalid will use Shadi again
to try to tie me up.

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:55.561
If that moment comes, and I am tied up,

00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:59.940
you must use your final wish
to save yourself.

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:04.028
You must make a righteous wish. Got it?

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.575
It seems you've decided where you'll go.

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:15.289
Well, I'll never let you go.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.460
I knew that wouldn't work.

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:31.889
By the way,
do psychopaths really not feel love?

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:35.559
You know, being ready
to give your life for someone else.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.061
I would be willing

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:39.396
to kill for someone else.

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:42.066
Doesn't that count as love?

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:44.985
Hey, Choi Da-jin. Look at this!

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:48.113
That old interview we did
with the psychopath is blowing up again!

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:50.407
It's trending at number nine!

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.160
There's even a meme in the comments…

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:58.207
"I worked late instead of my manager.
Doesn't that count as love?"

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.627
"I binged on food instead of my boyfriend.
Doesn't that count as love?"

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.421
"I only ate the tails
of the fish-shaped pastry for you."

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:06.298
Only the tails? That's mental.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.593
This is fucking hilarious.

00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:11.178
So what will we do

00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:14.056
about the wishes?

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:17.518
You're talking about that again?

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:20.020
I'm so sick of this.

00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:22.398
Let's just enjoy the moment for a while!

00:16:26.568 --> 00:16:27.486
No.

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:31.740
Let's just get a divorce.

00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:33.158
What?

00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:37.162
You said you had two wishes left, right?
Give me one of them as alimony.

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:38.497
A divorce?

00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:41.542
Have you gone insane?

00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:42.876
Hey.

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:46.588
Frankly speaking, they're my wishes.
Who do you think you are?

00:16:47.297 --> 00:16:50.342
Right. This is how
you really feel, isn't it?

00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:52.344
Son of a bitch.

00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:56.682
What? Hey, what did you
just call me? Son of a bitch?

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.103
This person really is Oh Pan-geum?

00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:04.815
That's right, Oh Pan-geum. The third
daughter of the lady from Bukcheon.

00:17:05.315 --> 00:17:09.236
She was the prettiest thing in Hadong
and moved to Seoul when she got married.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.196
That smile is her, all right.

00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:14.116
Her husband was from Chungcheong-do.

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:17.494
Last I heard,
both their daughters got married.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.121
Let me take a look.

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:24.168
My word! This was when
she was a young thing.

00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:26.378
But why are you looking for her anyway?

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.756
What is it? Did Pan-geum here die?

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.718
No, she's very healthy.

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:34.636
That's good to hear.

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:42.644
I'm not quite sure
what he does for a living.

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.730
He mostly tells me to make a wish.

00:17:44.813 --> 00:17:47.107
Holy smokes, my teeth
must have gotten younger too.

00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:49.860
Don't ask me anything about those two.

00:17:49.943 --> 00:17:50.903
My deal?

00:17:50.986 --> 00:17:53.822
One thing I know for certain
is that he isn't human.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:56.408
If I can't ask anything…

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.578
and he isn't human

00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:02.289
and asks people to make wishes…

00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:11.965
I'm so stunned, all I can do is laugh.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.720
Why? Just wear them out.

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:18.764
I just want to buy you something.

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:22.351
Wear these and go wherever you want to go.

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.603
Wherever that may be,

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:27.397
I'm sure it'll be the right path.

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:29.316
Okay?

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:38.033
If Mi-ju…

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:42.121
is actually Grandma…

00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:31.670
Ka-young. This is the soybean paste jar.

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.673
Once every month, open the lid

00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:38.886
to check for mold growing on the surface
beneath the top salt layer

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:41.763
and for signs of bugs.

00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:50.189
When the weather is nice,
leave the lid open so it gets some sun.

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.357
This is the soy sauce jar.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.403
If you happen to see
any white patches of mold,

00:19:56.486 --> 00:20:00.699
scoop them away,
give it a good boil, and pour it back in.

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:27.351
That means I'll be fine

00:20:28.435 --> 00:20:29.561
until next spring.

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:31.855
That's good enough.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:36.944
People die of accidents or illness.

00:20:38.153 --> 00:20:40.906
It wouldn't be all that strange
to die at this age anyway.

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:46.536
Oh my. You're up already?

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.872
You should sleep in on your day off.

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:50.874
I need to go to the workshop.

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:55.003
But, Grandma, why do you keep
looking at that tree?

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:20.654
What are you doing?

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:23.031
Thinking about whether to fix it.

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.950
But from here,

00:21:25.742 --> 00:21:28.954
I have the point of view
of a corpse buried in a hole.

00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:31.498
You sure have a way with words.

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.298
Would this mean we're buried together?

00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:41.883
You're going to make things
this easy for me?

00:21:48.598 --> 00:21:51.018
Should we go for a carpet ride tomorrow?

00:21:51.768 --> 00:21:52.602
You can.

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:56.982
I'm going to Seoul with Grandma tomorrow.

00:21:57.482 --> 00:21:59.151
You ride your carpet

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:01.236
and fix the roof.

00:22:02.237 --> 00:22:03.238
Why Seoul?

00:22:04.948 --> 00:22:08.327
Because I want Grandma to have
some ordinary memories of me.

00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:13.415
All right.

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:21.631
I have one of those to make too.

00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:33.685
Sweet! A KO win!

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:34.770
You little…

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.774
I need to go home now.

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:41.777
Hey, that's not fair.
I haven't won a single game yet.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.113
You should go home soon too, mister.
There's no place like home.

00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:48.950
That sure doesn't sound like you.

00:22:49.743 --> 00:22:52.871
- Did you buy a house, by any chance?
- That's not funny.

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:55.957
You can't tell anyone this,

00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:59.378
but an angel granted my wish.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.506
Mom's boyfriend disappeared.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:07.386
It's time I cut back on arcade games
so my mom doesn't worry.

00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:12.391
I didn't expect this kind of fallout.

00:23:14.684 --> 00:23:15.769
Kim Sang-hyeok!

00:23:18.105 --> 00:23:19.106
It's been really fun.

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.025
And you're my bro.

00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:25.529
Never forget that.

00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:27.406
What's with you?

00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:30.826
I said I'd cut back.
I didn't say I'd quit entirely.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.702
See you tomorrow.

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:52.431
You're not going?

00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:53.849
Why not?

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:57.310
It's the department store.
The new winter collection's out.

00:23:58.103 --> 00:23:59.521
I have a lot of clothes.

00:24:00.188 --> 00:24:02.399
I have plenty to last me
until next February.

00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:04.860
Instead…

00:24:06.653 --> 00:24:07.988
let's go somewhere else.

00:24:09.698 --> 00:24:10.699
Where exactly?

00:24:12.742 --> 00:24:14.578
You wanted to come here?

00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:17.205
Why?

00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:20.250
Because I want to be pretty
in your memories.

00:24:21.751 --> 00:24:25.255
Don't I look pretty? Don't I look cute?
Aren't I just to die for?

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:28.884
In my memories?

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:33.513
Why does it seem like
she has the same idea as me?

00:24:36.892 --> 00:24:37.767
Smile.

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:42.522
Like this.

00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:44.691
Hurry and do this!

00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:47.068
Like this? Maybe?

00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:49.321
All right.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.784
Oh boy!

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.745
How pretty.

00:24:58.705 --> 00:25:00.290
Why do people even do this?

00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:02.459
Why not? It's so much fun.

00:25:03.418 --> 00:25:06.171
Let's have coffee and enjoy ourselves
just a little longer.

00:25:06.254 --> 00:25:09.508
Go and buy me something sweet, all right?

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.218
- Fine.
- Great.

00:25:13.803 --> 00:25:15.222
Goodness me.

00:26:09.818 --> 00:26:12.320
Half the lights on your sign are out.

00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:14.656
Trying to tell the world you're single?

00:26:16.116 --> 00:26:17.576
I saw that too.

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:21.246
I smell gamja-tang.

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:23.415
It must be Wednesday.

00:26:23.498 --> 00:26:26.209
I got it to go, though,
from a different place.

00:26:27.294 --> 00:26:28.128
Let's eat.

00:26:30.213 --> 00:26:32.299
I thought you'd get mad at me.

00:26:32.382 --> 00:26:34.217
This is your routine.

00:26:39.639 --> 00:26:43.226
CHEONGPUNG VILLAGE HALL

00:26:48.023 --> 00:26:50.650
Grandma? How is Hawaii?

00:26:51.818 --> 00:26:53.069
Ka-young is well.

00:26:53.653 --> 00:26:55.822
Have you tried the coconut shrimp yet?

00:26:56.323 --> 00:26:57.991
That sounds delicious.

00:26:58.533 --> 00:27:00.035
Bullshit.

00:27:00.577 --> 00:27:03.705
She's not somewhere nicer.
She's still in Hawaii.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.702
I'm going to stop holding
the ancestral rites now.

00:27:44.037 --> 00:27:45.664
This is the last time.

00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:48.333
Why?

00:27:48.917 --> 00:27:51.252
We've already done enough.

00:27:52.545 --> 00:27:53.880
When I die,

00:27:54.422 --> 00:27:55.965
don't bother with any rites.

00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:57.759
Don't do a thing.

00:27:58.718 --> 00:28:01.262
Cremate me and scatter my ashes somewhere.

00:28:04.307 --> 00:28:06.726
Leave it and go now.
It's a 12 o'clock flight, right?

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.478
It's at 11:45.

00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:12.190
I've told Mr. Park to come,
so stay close to him.

00:28:12.273 --> 00:28:14.025
I'll be back soon, okay?

00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:16.319
All right. Go on.

00:28:23.743 --> 00:28:25.745
I'm not sure what I wished for,

00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:29.499
but I think it led to a very grim end.

00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:31.251
So I'm scared.

00:28:55.483 --> 00:28:56.359
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:28:56.443 --> 00:29:00.280
You've been rubbing this lamp
for three hours now.

00:29:00.363 --> 00:29:01.990
It's only right that you buy it.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.200
It's yours for 1,000 dirhams.

00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:08.288
How about a discount?

00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:13.752
Status update. Keeping a close watch.

00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:15.420
Nothing to worry about here.

00:29:15.503 --> 00:29:16.504
Thank you.

00:29:21.384 --> 00:29:22.635
What?

00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:24.929
What do you want? What?

00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:32.687
TISAH

00:30:02.926 --> 00:30:04.344
CONSULATE EMERGENCY HOTLINE

00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:26.074
Would you go easy on the rubbing?

00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:32.121
So you were avoiding me.

00:30:32.205 --> 00:30:33.790
So what if I was?

00:30:33.873 --> 00:30:36.709
When will you drop the attitude?
You'll be lucky to hit 100.

00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:41.005
You recognized me the moment you saw me.
You called me the "bitch from back then."

00:30:42.215 --> 00:30:44.342
Back when, in what time, was I that bitch?

00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:46.594
Tell me everything you know.

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:48.513
This is my first wish.

00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:51.224
Silly girl, what the hell are you saying?

00:30:51.975 --> 00:30:54.143
I cannot grant things like wishes.

00:30:54.644 --> 00:30:57.355
Only Iblis can do that.

00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:03.111
Then I'll ask you very nicely.

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:08.408
What's with your smile?

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:14.330
The thing with Iblis is,
his mere presence makes us feel pathetic.

00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:17.125
He stood at the front lines in the war…

00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:23.923
and he saved us from the angels.

00:31:24.632 --> 00:31:27.176
All of us bowed our heads to you humans,

00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:30.305
but he adamantly refused
and wound up in hell.

00:31:30.805 --> 00:31:34.267
So to think the death of a mere human
made him level an entire city…

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.352
I couldn't wrap my head around it.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.605
And that was me?

00:31:42.483 --> 00:31:43.484
Yes, it was you.

00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:47.572
You swept an entire city away
with gold rain. The bitch from back then.

00:31:49.449 --> 00:31:51.409
Gold rain?

00:31:51.492 --> 00:31:54.037
It was a dazzling and beautiful hell.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.080
It was the rage of Iblis.

00:31:56.664 --> 00:31:58.583
Why is his rage gold?

00:32:00.376 --> 00:32:01.210
I don't know.

00:32:02.378 --> 00:32:03.463
You don't know?

00:32:04.047 --> 00:32:05.590
I don't want to know.

00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:09.469
Why do you think Iblis has no memories?

00:32:12.221 --> 00:32:13.640
Right, I'm sorry.

00:32:13.723 --> 00:32:15.683
If you're sorry, never come back here.

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:18.978
This cancels out the time I danced for joy
when Muttalib killed you.

00:32:19.062 --> 00:32:20.146
Go.

00:32:20.229 --> 00:32:23.107
So the jerk who killed me…

00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:26.903
Thank you.

00:32:30.657 --> 00:32:33.534
By any chance,
has Iblis ever called you habibti?

00:32:37.538 --> 00:32:39.207
Has anyone ever thrown water on you?

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.001
So it was me.

00:32:51.511 --> 00:32:54.514
Irem!

00:33:04.774 --> 00:33:07.151
Why did you ask to see me?
I just rolled out of bed.

00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:09.028
Take a seat.

00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.863
Sure.

00:33:15.326 --> 00:33:16.536
I don't know the details,

00:33:16.619 --> 00:33:19.122
but I have a feeling
there's more going on than we know.

00:33:19.205 --> 00:33:21.624
When that day comes,
there is something you must do.

00:33:23.084 --> 00:33:25.378
No cotton candy,
and you're already talking like that.

00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:26.629
What could be going on?

00:33:27.922 --> 00:33:30.091
You and I are both our masters' servants.

00:33:30.591 --> 00:33:34.012
So if there comes a time
when you need to make a choice,

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:36.472
do so as your master's mythical beast.

00:33:37.056 --> 00:33:39.017
I'll decide as I should too. Got it?

00:33:40.643 --> 00:33:43.354
I came all dressed up.
What an odd way for you to dump me.

00:33:45.273 --> 00:33:47.859
Didn't you just roll out of bed?
Your ears are showing.

00:33:47.942 --> 00:33:49.027
I sleep like this.

00:33:49.652 --> 00:33:50.903
- What are those?
- How cute.

00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:53.573
- Buy me some.
- Sure, let's get them.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.704
MY CHANNEL

00:33:59.787 --> 00:34:01.789
SKY FARM LIFE

00:34:10.089 --> 00:34:13.551
NEW PASSWORD: 1 GENIE WISH IS MINE!

00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:19.640
PASSWORD CHANGED

00:34:26.022 --> 00:34:27.940
YOUR CHANNEL HAS BEEN DELETED

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:32.111
Hey, Choi Da-jin!

00:34:32.195 --> 00:34:35.364
Hey, what's wrong with our channel?
Can you access it?

00:34:35.948 --> 00:34:40.453
Damn it, the channel got deleted!
What the hell is going on?

00:34:42.163 --> 00:34:46.167
Do you think someone reported us?
This will be the death of me, damn it.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.251
No.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.337
I just deleted it.

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:52.340
What? Are you insane?

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:55.009
Do you know what I did
to get all those subscribers?

00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:56.385
Have you gone insane?

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:57.512
Hey!

00:34:58.346 --> 00:35:00.807
You said to separate
what's yours and mine.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.226
I made this account under my name.

00:35:03.851 --> 00:35:07.939
If the wishes are yours,
this YouTube channel was always mine!

00:35:08.022 --> 00:35:11.234
Wow, you're completely insane!

00:35:11.317 --> 00:35:15.696
Hey, cut the bullshit.
I built it up when I found the corpse!

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:19.033
Whatever.
Get the genie here in front of me.

00:35:20.159 --> 00:35:22.537
If we don't act in two weeks,
it's gone forever.

00:35:23.037 --> 00:35:26.582
Consider it carefully.
Only I can restore the account.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.087
Seriously, what you just did right now.

00:35:31.587 --> 00:35:33.756
You better not fucking regret it later.

00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:37.677
This is my second wish.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.639
Make it so that Da-jin doesn't remember
a thing I told her about the wishes.

00:35:41.722 --> 00:35:43.224
Make her forget

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.643
every single detail.

00:35:47.395 --> 00:35:48.938
Right now, damn it.

00:35:49.564 --> 00:35:51.440
Hey. For starters, it's been fulfilled.

00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:54.026
I was halfway across the Gobi Desert
when you called me.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.362
This is just text,
but you can hear me, can't you?

00:35:56.445 --> 00:35:57.446
A deep, velvety voice?

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:01.534
Did you think of a final wish
to make now too? Even if so, think more!

00:36:01.617 --> 00:36:03.369
Be grateful I'm giving you the chance,

00:36:03.452 --> 00:36:06.539
and don't use words
like "right now" or "hurry." Understand?

00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:24.223
I told you to carry the lamp.

00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:26.976
I was in a hurry,
so I left it at the hotel.

00:36:28.394 --> 00:36:31.022
I thought I might recall something,
but no luck.

00:36:32.064 --> 00:36:33.065
Man.

00:36:36.903 --> 00:36:37.862
You scared me.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:44.035
Hug me tighter.
It might help me recall something.

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:46.412
What is it you want to recall?

00:36:46.495 --> 00:36:49.582
Muttalib from the sign over there.
Or the recurring villain, Khalid.

00:36:50.166 --> 00:36:53.920
Or the joy or sorrow
that you and I felt in our past lives?

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:57.632
This seems strategic.

00:36:58.507 --> 00:37:00.009
You're mistaken. Hug me tighter!

00:37:30.122 --> 00:37:30.957
You…

00:37:31.958 --> 00:37:34.418
You're dressed strangely today.

00:37:35.294 --> 00:37:36.712
Your hair is shorter too.

00:37:38.673 --> 00:37:39.966
Are we ready to leave?

00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:41.717
We're leaving?

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:50.476
You're here, so why would I?

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:54.105
Did I have a new master?

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:57.525
You seem a little odd today.

00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:59.527
Muttalib is your master.

00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:03.322
He must finally be ready
to make his final wish.

00:38:05.491 --> 00:38:09.912
That means we really are
leaving tonight, right?

00:38:11.372 --> 00:38:12.206
For Goryeo.

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.792
Muttalib was my new master?

00:38:32.935 --> 00:38:33.978
What's wrong?

00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:41.152
Hey.

00:38:42.737 --> 00:38:43.738
Snap out of it.

00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:50.119
There is a chance that…

00:38:52.121 --> 00:38:54.081
I never managed to get you to Goryeo.

00:38:57.376 --> 00:38:59.587
I think that's the reason my sword

00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:02.715
is stuck over there.

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.010
What are you saying?

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:10.348
Oh?

00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:12.516
You recalled something?

00:39:14.977 --> 00:39:16.479
It actually worked?

00:39:16.562 --> 00:39:18.356
Come here. Let's trade places.

00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:38.250
I feel just the same,
so when exactly did I get so old?

00:39:46.842 --> 00:39:48.677
Oh my, it's you!

00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:51.889
You came back without a word?
When did you get here?

00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:55.017
Hello.

00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:59.814
Good heavens,
I was so sure it was Pan-geum.

00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:01.982
I must have been mistaken.

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:04.026
Never you mind.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:10.574
Why the hell is she weeding a field
that isn't even hers?

00:40:19.375 --> 00:40:20.501
Wait a moment.

00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:30.177
OH PAN-GEUM

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:33.180
The person you've called
is currently unavailable.

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:35.558
Please leave a message after the beep.

00:40:37.476 --> 00:40:40.646
The more I think about it,
the stranger it all gets.

00:40:41.147 --> 00:40:43.816
She sends texts
and talks with Min-ji on the phone,

00:40:44.316 --> 00:40:46.610
so why did she only cut us off?

00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:49.321
Yesterday was the anniversary
of her old man's passing.

00:40:50.156 --> 00:40:51.615
So who did the ancestral rites?

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:04.086
That tramp was getting groceries
for the ancestral rites table!

00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:06.213
Goodness me.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.844
I thought you'd say the observation deck.

00:41:12.511 --> 00:41:15.097
I don't want to stand
on the edge of anything anymore.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.309
So why did you express
your rage with gold?

00:41:18.392 --> 00:41:21.187
It was a dazzling and beautiful hell.

00:41:22.104 --> 00:41:23.731
It was the rage of Iblis.

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:26.901
Do rage and gold even go together?

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:28.986
Gold? What do you mean by that?

00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:31.155
Pointless if you don't remember.
Let's move on.

00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:38.704
Either way, we knew each other
during those lost 20 years.

00:41:39.705 --> 00:41:42.500
A 28-year-old you
definitely existed by my side.

00:41:43.918 --> 00:41:46.504
- But Muttalib means "foreigner."
- We just knew each other?

00:41:47.254 --> 00:41:49.632
But I was your one and only habibti.

00:41:49.715 --> 00:41:52.801
Our relationship
was definitely incredibly serious.

00:41:52.885 --> 00:41:54.887
You said it was 50-50 with Jinniya.

00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:58.182
Don't tell me…

00:42:04.897 --> 00:42:06.190
Do you have an umbrella?

00:42:07.107 --> 00:42:08.150
An umbrella?

00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:13.614
Wow, this woman sure is thorough.

00:42:15.574 --> 00:42:16.575
It's raining. Kiss.

00:42:16.659 --> 00:42:18.369
Hey, we're in Arabia.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.795
But it's not raining here!

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.588
We broke that rule a long time ago.

00:42:30.464 --> 00:42:31.382
You didn't buy it.

00:42:31.465 --> 00:42:34.343
Man, I'm hungry.
Don't you have anything to eat?

00:42:35.636 --> 00:42:37.179
I almost used my third wish.

00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:40.057
Do it.

00:42:40.808 --> 00:42:42.268
Yeah, right. Give me food!

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.145
You let me go hungry all the time.

00:42:46.689 --> 00:42:48.107
Dry up while I set the table.

00:43:17.845 --> 00:43:19.680
This was here?

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:23.392
Wait. Hey, get rid of this right now.
No, burn it quickly. Let it rot!

00:43:24.059 --> 00:43:25.436
Come on, this is…

00:43:25.519 --> 00:43:27.313
Do I look similar to my past life?

00:43:29.189 --> 00:43:30.024
What?

00:43:48.334 --> 00:43:49.209
Yes.

00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:51.712
You look similar.

00:43:52.588 --> 00:43:53.672
Right?

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:58.469
I also think I look
exactly as I did in the hourglass.

00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:01.930
So who's prettier? Me or her?

00:44:02.681 --> 00:44:03.891
No, don't tell me.

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:06.226
No. Tell me.

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:08.604
- Oh, well--
- Never mind. It's me.

00:44:11.357 --> 00:44:12.232
And what is that?

00:44:13.776 --> 00:44:14.777
What?

00:44:18.864 --> 00:44:19.865
What is?

00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:28.332
Move over.

00:44:28.415 --> 00:44:29.458
It's ramyeon.

00:44:33.128 --> 00:44:35.964
Man, I told them to prepare
a proper Korean meal.

00:44:44.056 --> 00:44:45.099
Bring the fruit over.

00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:46.642
What? Sure.

00:44:58.362 --> 00:45:01.073
So do you really waltz by yourself?
Without a partner?

00:45:02.116 --> 00:45:03.158
Waltz?

00:45:05.285 --> 00:45:06.328
I've never waltzed.

00:45:07.621 --> 00:45:08.664
I don't know how.

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:13.419
Then why do they call the sand whirls
in the desert "a waltzing genie"?

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:18.882
Moving on.

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:25.889
Fine, then.

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:28.976
Let's turn the legend into an actual fact.

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:37.776
Follow me. For old time's sake,

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:39.820
let's tear it up.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:42.573
Right.

00:46:06.054 --> 00:46:08.849
There is a round ball
between the two of us right now.

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:10.392
That ball is a small universe.

00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:13.645
The waltz is all about
maintaining that distance

00:46:13.729 --> 00:46:17.399
while dancing around
an even larger universe.

00:46:17.983 --> 00:46:20.152
- Do you understand?
- What? Yes.

00:46:20.235 --> 00:46:23.322
Just let yourself fall under my spell.
Follow me in a trance.

00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:26.658
Now left foot forward.

00:46:27.701 --> 00:46:30.704
One, two, three, back.

00:46:30.788 --> 00:46:34.041
- Back.
- One, two, three, forward.

00:46:38.003 --> 00:46:40.214
Are you going to keep stepping on my feet?

00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:42.216
This is a battle, not a dance.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.135
How is it that whatever we do,
it becomes a duel?

00:46:47.596 --> 00:46:49.973
And when exactly
did you fall under my spell?

00:46:50.057 --> 00:46:51.058
Back.

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:55.646
The second time I saw you?

00:46:56.396 --> 00:46:57.606
But that was at the hotel.

00:46:58.649 --> 00:46:59.483
Really?

00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:02.027
That early on?

00:47:03.237 --> 00:47:05.739
Yes. I knew the moment I saw you.

00:47:08.075 --> 00:47:10.202
You come after the cars I fix.

00:47:10.285 --> 00:47:12.287
The adjustable wrenches I grip.

00:47:12.788 --> 00:47:13.914
Let's stop.

00:47:16.625 --> 00:47:18.377
The wheels I roll.

00:47:18.877 --> 00:47:21.713
- The hammers I use.
- I said stop.

00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:26.593
The crowbars I use.

00:47:27.135 --> 00:47:29.263
The sound of dental scaling I like.

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:34.560
My auto shop, gamja-tang, Grandma,

00:47:35.727 --> 00:47:37.521
Min-ji.

00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:41.191
Sea louse…

00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:33.076
Pan-geum definitely made this.

00:48:34.119 --> 00:48:36.955
Pan-geum, that bitch. She's here.

00:48:37.873 --> 00:48:41.126
Gosh, why is this tooth
bothering me so much?

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:43.503
Gosh.

00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:51.261
What are you doing here, ma'am?

00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:55.807
You'd better come clean.
Where is Pan-geum?

00:48:56.558 --> 00:48:57.768
She's in Hawaii…

00:48:58.352 --> 00:48:59.603
Don't give me that crap.

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:03.440
This tastes exactly like Pan-geum's work.
She's here, isn't she?

00:49:04.483 --> 00:49:06.443
How dare you hide her away
while you con us!

00:49:07.194 --> 00:49:09.071
Lead the way! I need to see her now!

00:49:09.154 --> 00:49:12.074
Please let go of me.
Why are you doing this?

00:49:12.157 --> 00:49:14.326
Tramp. Where do you think
you're going? Come here.

00:49:16.411 --> 00:49:18.413
That mole.

00:49:18.956 --> 00:49:21.291
Pan-geum has that mole there too.

00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:23.293
What the hell is this?

00:49:23.377 --> 00:49:25.337
Are you Pan-geum?

00:49:26.004 --> 00:49:28.757
- Is that you, Pan-geum?
- No, I'm not!

00:49:30.676 --> 00:49:32.386
- Oh dearie!
- Dearie!

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:36.056
You are! You are Pan-geum!

00:49:38.058 --> 00:49:39.101
It's Pan-geum!

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.479
Heung-rye!

00:49:42.562 --> 00:49:45.899
Good heavens! How on earth
could something like this happen?

00:49:45.983 --> 00:49:46.817
Heung-rye!

00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:50.112
Heung-rye.
Please just hear me out. Please?

00:49:50.195 --> 00:49:52.364
Let go, you wretched witch!

00:49:52.447 --> 00:49:54.658
My Lord!

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:58.245
I was wondering where you hid her,
but you were Pan-geum all along?

00:49:58.745 --> 00:50:02.666
What the hell did you do?
How the hell did you become so young?

00:50:02.749 --> 00:50:07.879
I'll tell you everything.
So please don't tell anyone else!

00:50:07.963 --> 00:50:10.465
You disgust me. Let go, you bitch!

00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:12.342
Dear Lord!

00:50:12.926 --> 00:50:14.469
Gosh, Heung-rye. Please!

00:50:24.146 --> 00:50:26.565
What? That bitch is Oh Pan-geum?

00:50:28.483 --> 00:50:30.485
So that's how she kept her grandma hidden.

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:34.489
I see. That's how she used her wish.

00:50:34.573 --> 00:50:36.908
Let's start by
getting rid of that old bitch

00:50:36.992 --> 00:50:38.660
before she runs her mouth more.

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:40.203
Ishrun.

00:50:40.787 --> 00:50:42.664
You know what to do, right?

00:50:53.633 --> 00:50:54.843
Let's go home now.

00:50:56.178 --> 00:50:57.804
I'll go and get changed.

00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:59.514
Are my clothes dry?

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.516
Of course.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:28.325

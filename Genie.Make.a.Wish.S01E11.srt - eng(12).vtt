GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:17.243
"Make sure you are punished too, spirit."

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.790
That was already 20 years ago.

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:25.335
But no matter how long I wait,
the punishment just doesn't come.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:28.338
You should still be careful.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.840
And watch what you say and do.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:31.883
Quiet, you.

00:01:32.717 --> 00:01:34.552
Why should I be careful?

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.013
I am the almighty Genie, after all.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:40.016
Man, this is stressful.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.496
The smell of this clay.

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:16.261
What the… You're that…

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.556
You're still alive?

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:21.891
Who are you?

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.687
How do you know the language of Goryeo?
Are you from Goryeo?

00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:27.772
Don't you remember me?

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:33.570
It's definitely you.
You've been alive all this time?

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.865
I clearly remember seeing you die.
Your breath just…

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.992
I'm sure of it.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:44.038
Seeing those bite marks, it is you.
Gee, you're a mess.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.248
You're being rude.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.420
I'm just really curious.

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:52.130
I'm actually a genie.

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.258
And we've met before. 20 years ago.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:57.635
Back then,
your final wish was my punishment.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.971
But I'm just fine. What do you think?

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.973
Don't remember that either?

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:09.105
Dates for sale! Buy some dates!

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:11.733
Dates for sale!

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:19.199
Oh no.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.784
My dates.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.081
Oh dear.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.583
You're bleeding.

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:30.710
You're more hurt than those dates.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.379
What a thing to say!

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:36.007
You tripped me, didn't you?

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:39.135
What are you going to do about these?

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:46.226
What shall I do about this?

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.898
Do I fully corrupt her,
seeing as she's survived?

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.858
Oh my, what a waste.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.864
I asked what you're going to do
about all these.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.459
How about this? Payment for the dates.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.521
These are on the house.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.648
I hope you enjoy them.

Dates for sale!

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.320
Buy some dates!

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:42.490
Just look at you.
You're well on your way to corruption.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:46.411
You're already corrupt.
Great, let's just push a little harder.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.456
Dates for sale! Buy some dates!

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.251
I'm already having so much fun.
Where do you live?

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:55.086
Where is my money?

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.046
My money's gone!

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.264
Take this.

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:08.057
Eat this.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:18.609
I got very lucky today.

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:20.778
Please eat.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.031
Thank you.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:31.581
Be careful.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:34.876
Don't touch me, you filthy slave girl.

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:43.426
I can't hear any of those words.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.346
It's all so difficult.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:49.891
I can't understand a word.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:20.546
My goodness!

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:25.593
You live here?

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.263
How did you find your way here?

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.100
Go away. I'll get cast out if anyone sees.

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:34.102
Don't worry. Only you can see me.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:38.439
Besides, no one
seems to care about you at all.

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.488
Humans sure are shallow, aren't they?

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:48.950
They'll ostracize and judge you
even if you're just a tad bit different.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.785
Don't bad-mouth them.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.038
They gave me work to do
and a place to sleep.

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:57.583
Just hurry and get out of here
before you get caught.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.293
I'm just intrigued.

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:02.422
A human who used
all her wishes for others.

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:05.633
One who even dared
to mention me in her final wish.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.013
Wow.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.641
That's what my punishment was!

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:16.644
With no humans to corrupt for 20 years,
I almost died of boredom.

00:07:16.727 --> 00:07:18.312
That was my punishment!

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.273
You lived, so I never found a new master!

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:21.649
What are you talking about?

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:23.776
I told you I've never made wishes.

00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:26.529
Well, well, playing dumb, are we?

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:29.323
You're in this foreign land
with that face of a foreigner.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:33.161
You may act resolute now, but you will
eventually show your true colors.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.204
Then you'll be corrupt in no time.

00:07:40.334 --> 00:07:43.004
Did you say only I can see you?

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.047
Yes.

00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:47.800
It's one of my main magical…

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.971
But why aren't you surprised?

00:07:52.513 --> 00:07:53.723
Most humans are.

00:07:55.516 --> 00:07:58.603
You said you're a ji-ne.
We have centipedes in Goryeo too.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:03.483
The elders said that a thousand-year-old
centipede could wield magic.

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:06.110
I'm a genie, not a ji-ne.

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:11.073
So why did you ask
if only you could see me?

00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:14.619
It just seems like a shame.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:22.251
You're so striking when you smile.

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:39.185
"Striking"?

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:41.729
That must be
the highest of compliments in Goryeo.

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:01.999
Why did you come here?

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.002
Why else would I come to a camel market?

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.796
I'm here to buy a camel.

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.297
Why are you buying a camel?

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.674
So I can return

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:11.300
to Goryeo.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:18.516
Are you looking for a camel?
All the good ones are over there.

00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:23.104
Stay here and don't interfere.

00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:35.157
No! My gold coins! No!

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:49.630
Stop!

00:10:05.896 --> 00:10:07.398
It's Shaytan! The Devil!

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:08.983
It's Shaytan!

00:10:17.908 --> 00:10:18.868
Here.

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:24.290
You… really are Shaytan.

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.587
How could you kill a person?

00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:33.466
He took your coins.

00:10:34.508 --> 00:10:35.760
This only happened

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:40.431
because I was being
too greedy in the first place.

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:45.227
I was paid too much for the dates.

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:52.151
I never want to see you again.

00:11:36.904 --> 00:11:39.240
I returned the coins
to their original owner.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.034
And that jerk really did deserve to die.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.746
You weren't the only one he wronged.
I'm sure the other humans would be

00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:47.581
happy.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.208
Probably.

00:11:50.626 --> 00:11:54.338
Hey, what am I supposed to do
when that's how I am? I'm Shaytan.

00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.427
When will you be

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:01.220
going to Goryeo?

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.058
Perhaps it would be faster
to cross the Gobi Desert.

00:12:09.478 --> 00:12:10.479
Want me to take you?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.405
Do you

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.824
know the way?

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:23.492
Somewhat.

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:25.911
I once blocked the path.

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.706
I'll find out, so stop being mad.

00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:30.166
Really?

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:35.880
Then I'll start saving for a camel again.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:38.674
Please show me the way.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:59.445
Why do you live like this anyway?
Doesn't it make you angry?

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.616
I died and came back to life,

00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:05.701
though I don't remember it.

00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:10.623
I must have gained
the scars on my body then.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:16.545
There must be a reason
I was kept alive in this world.

00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:20.216
And so, I should live life to the fullest.

00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:51.956
How foolish.

00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:54.124
There's no such thing as the right wish.

00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:57.378
To gain something,
something else must be lost.

00:13:57.461 --> 00:14:00.339
For someone to live, another must die.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.675
Sade!

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.774
Khalid.

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:08.824
I bought this from a Khitan merchant.

00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:13.078
He told me it was good for coughs.

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:15.664
Boil it and drink the water.

00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:20.669
So you care for all the young and old?

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:22.129
Don't.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.591
Humans betray those closest to them
and never learn gratitude.

00:15:28.552 --> 00:15:30.095
Isn't that right?

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:33.974
I see you are half human and half spirit.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.269
Apparently, his father sings.

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:39.563
Are you Shadi's son?

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:44.485
You are sick and weak
because you were born with a human body.

00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:50.199
You're Iblis, aren't you?

00:15:50.824 --> 00:15:55.746
Are you not the leader of spirits?
Could you please make me better?

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:57.748
Please make me a complete spirit.

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:00.125
I know you can do anything.

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:09.635
This thread can bind spirits.

00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:12.888
I will gladly
give this to you as an offering.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.598
I don't need it.

00:16:15.849 --> 00:16:20.312
We may be related,
but I simply cannot fulfill your request.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.398
Let's go.

00:16:59.643 --> 00:17:02.563
Hey, lie down to sleep.
Why are you sleeping like this?

00:17:04.064 --> 00:17:06.608
I told you to let me know
before showing up.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.486
Hey, how much clearer
could I have let you know…

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:15.784
What are you making every night anyway?
While losing sleep too.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.119
Hanbok.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.330
To wear on my journey back to Goryeo.

00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:24.334
But I need to work during the day.

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:29.089
It's dark as night in here.

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:31.341
Follow me.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.563
This is where you live?

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:48.025
Wow, it's like a palace.

00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:49.985
You've never been in a palace.

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:54.198
Hey. I'm from Gaegyeong.

00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:57.284
There are so many
magnificent palaces there.

00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:01.497
Just standing at the gates
and seeing them from a distance, you know?

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:04.958
Their presence is just, you know?

00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:06.710
So you've never been inside.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.255
I got close enough
to be practically inside.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:11.673
What else is there?

00:18:12.716 --> 00:18:14.301
How does it differ from here?

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:20.307
Goryeo has

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:22.559
four distinct seasons.

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:28.482
The summers are hot like it is here,
but in fall, the leaves change color.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.778
And in winter,
white snow falls from the sky.

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:37.908
When the plum blossoms bloom
through those snowflakes,

00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.119
it's spring.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.082
And when the plum blossoms wither,

00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:47.167
the cherry blossoms bloom.

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:54.007
Cherry blossoms are really pretty.

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:24.496
Back in Goryeo,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.791
we wrote our wishes and sent them out
on boats down small streams.

00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:30.502
We believed
that the wishes would come true

00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:33.505
if the boat reached the ocean.

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:38.385
Consider it the ocean at night.
How far shall I send them for you?

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:42.764
Far, far away.

00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:47.227
Beyond the place
where the land meets the sky.

00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:50.230
Far away.

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:54.401
All the way to Goryeo.

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:09.708
What did you write on those boats anyway?

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:12.836
Never you mind.

00:20:15.505 --> 00:20:16.548
It looks like

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:20.177
it's raining stars.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.456
PLEASE DO NOT LET THIS WANDERER STARVE

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:55.837
PLEASE DO NOT LET ANYONE FALL VICTIM
TO THIS WANDERER'S STRIKING LOOKS

00:20:56.588 --> 00:21:01.510
PLEASE LET ME RETURN TO GORYEO

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.160
It is Ejllael!
He has come to take my soul.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.165
I will guide your soul
with these sacred wings.

00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:36.003
Did you say you will guide my soul

00:21:36.586 --> 00:21:39.298
with those sacred wings of yours?

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:40.716
Your soul will…

00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:42.217
Ouch ouchy!

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:45.304
He says my soul will go ouch ouchy!

00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:48.598
Ouch ouchy!

00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:51.977
Hey, you could just ask nicely!

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.522
Why would you just pluck my feathers?

00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:06.074
You, who came from Goryeo,
were living as a slave. Serves you right.

00:22:07.617 --> 00:22:10.662
They say, in Goryeo,
there is a centipede that wields magic.

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:13.957
I shall go up against it
when I get to Goryeo.

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.753
You wish upon stars.

00:22:22.215 --> 00:22:26.595
She used up all her wishes on others
and now makes wishes on silly stars.

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:29.306
She even wished for my sake.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:35.062
To think that she is concerned
for my body and my meals.

00:22:43.737 --> 00:22:46.656
Why should a fleeting moment matter
to one who is immortal?

00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:50.243
While Iblis was tied
to that girl's final wish…

00:22:52.245 --> 00:22:55.207
he was more interested in her
than in corrupting humans.

00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:57.918
Strangely, he seemed far more excited

00:22:58.001 --> 00:23:00.587
pondering what to feed her
and how to make her smile

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.924
than when he was scheming how to corrupt

00:23:04.424 --> 00:23:05.884
another human soul.

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:07.719
I know.

00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.432
It's just so sad, Master.

00:23:19.856 --> 00:23:23.610
I'm talking about how much
of a damn fool Iblis was.

00:23:23.693 --> 00:23:25.737
What am I to do
if you find this upsetting?

00:23:26.696 --> 00:23:28.865
I was too busy crying to see that, Master.

00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:30.659
Would you please repeat yourself?

00:23:33.537 --> 00:23:34.454
Look carefully.

00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:36.748
Get out!

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:55.600
Can't you find us some good clams?

00:23:56.518 --> 00:23:59.396
You keep bringing ones
full of these rocks.

00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:01.148
Just throw it out.

00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:06.486
That's hot.

00:24:08.738 --> 00:24:11.783
When will you complete that garment?
The Goryeo one.

00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:14.202
It's not easy to find the right fabric.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.331
- But I've almost finished.
- Can't you make it on the way?

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:21.126
Let's leave after eating.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.506
Really? Can we really go now?

00:24:28.842 --> 00:24:30.093
What about your lamp?

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:35.849
I'll pray that he hurls it
with all his power to Goryeo.

00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:41.730
You who are singular and omnipotent.

00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:45.025
You are benevolent and noble.

00:24:45.901 --> 00:24:47.444
You are also merciful

00:24:47.944 --> 00:24:50.655
and wise, and, well…

00:24:50.739 --> 00:24:52.449
You're also…

00:24:52.532 --> 00:24:54.659
You look incredibly desperate.

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.253
Hey, you're…

00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:08.548
You're glowing.

00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:11.134
It's a new master. But how?

00:25:14.471 --> 00:25:16.056
You were my last master,

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:19.142
and I should still be tied
to your final wish.

00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:21.811
How is it I have a new master?

00:25:21.895 --> 00:25:24.231
I'm not quite sure,
but isn't this a good thing?

00:25:24.814 --> 00:25:28.485
You said you were really bored
with no new master in 20 years.

00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:31.321
Maybe you're right.

00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:34.699
Well, then, I'll quickly go
and corrupt them.

00:25:58.598 --> 00:26:00.934
We meet at last, Iblis.

00:26:01.017 --> 00:26:04.479
Because of you,
I have lived the past two decades

00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:07.649
as an oppressed foreigner.

00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:27.168
It's Iblis! It's Shaytan!

00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:32.007
Where are you going?
Cast the Goryeo bitch aside too!

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:34.843
- Run!
- Help!

00:26:39.723 --> 00:26:42.517
So it seems I missed one.

00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:57.324
I wish to possess more
than anyone born of this land.

00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:02.078
So my first wish

00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:06.249
is for you to make me
the richest person in the world.

00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:16.343
How predictable.

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:20.388
Your wish has been fulfilled.

00:28:00.428 --> 00:28:01.262
You called me?

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:04.641
I have decided on my second wish, Genie.

00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:09.396
Kill all those who looked down on me.
Let them die in agony.

00:28:12.399 --> 00:28:15.568
You really are Shaytan.

00:28:16.403 --> 00:28:18.613
How could you kill a person?

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.373
Your wish has been fulfilled.

00:28:46.766 --> 00:28:50.770
Dates for sale! Buy some dates!

00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:54.524
Dates for sale! Buy some dates!

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.485
Dates for sale!

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:16.713
Are you…

00:29:16.796 --> 00:29:20.842
I got very lucky today.

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:22.135
Please eat.

00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:23.928
Thank you.

00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:27.348
Yes, it is I. Do you remember me?

00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:30.685
You gave me the sweetest of dates.

00:29:31.644 --> 00:29:33.605
Now I will give you everything you want.

00:29:33.688 --> 00:29:39.736
Garments and precious jewels.
A big house and countless servants.

00:29:39.819 --> 00:29:41.237
What do you say?

00:29:44.699 --> 00:29:46.701
I do not want anything

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:49.788
I did not earn by my own effort.

00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:54.292
And I will soon be leaving
for my hometown.

00:29:57.754 --> 00:30:00.089
You don't want it?
And you're leaving, you say?

00:30:00.173 --> 00:30:02.759
Now that I am looking down at you,
it is crystal clear.

00:30:02.842 --> 00:30:06.262
You are that slave girl
I bought to use as animal feed.

00:30:06.846 --> 00:30:09.933
And you dared to take pity on me?

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:18.149
How does it look?

00:30:23.738 --> 00:30:24.989
It's beautiful.

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:28.785
I had already finished making it.

00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:33.832
But I figured there was a chance
you couldn't leave this place.

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:36.084
Because of the wishes.

00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:41.089
I don't know the way,
and I couldn't just leave you behind.

00:30:48.221 --> 00:30:49.597
It's Muttalib's final wish.

00:30:50.723 --> 00:30:51.724
That means

00:30:52.308 --> 00:30:55.478
we really are leaving tonight, right?

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:57.021
For Goryeo.

00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:59.065
Yes. Let's go.

00:31:00.066 --> 00:31:03.027
I shall go to see
the four seasons of Goryeo,

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.864
where spring arrives
when winter snowflakes melt

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:08.491
and the cherry and plum blossoms bloom.

00:31:09.075 --> 00:31:11.202
If you can't find me, just call my name.

00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:14.706
The name for you to call me

00:31:15.498 --> 00:31:16.666
is Iblis.

00:31:17.792 --> 00:31:19.127
Iblis.

00:31:21.462 --> 00:31:22.589
Is your surname "Lee"?

00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:25.884
Is that a good thing?

00:31:27.176 --> 00:31:28.386
Let's say it is, then.

00:31:52.785 --> 00:31:55.955
So let's hear it. Your final wish.

00:31:56.039 --> 00:32:00.126
After claiming revenge
and wealth beyond measure,

00:32:00.209 --> 00:32:05.590
I have found
that some things remain priceless.

00:32:05.673 --> 00:32:08.343
My last wish is her complete submission.

00:32:09.052 --> 00:32:12.805
Make that bitch stay by my side
for the rest of her life.

00:32:22.315 --> 00:32:25.276
Your wish has been fulfilled.

00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:31.574
A heart that won't bow
for all the gold in the world?

00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:33.326
I'd like to see who this is.

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:50.259
Why are you…

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:55.765
Why are you here?

00:32:55.848 --> 00:32:57.976
Why the hell are you here?

00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:01.229
I see. You have come crawling back!

00:33:01.729 --> 00:33:04.524
Of course, who could resist
all the world's riches?

00:33:05.024 --> 00:33:08.152
Bring her to me right now!

00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:19.998
Why is Shaytan…

00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:27.463
Stop him! Stop Shaytan!

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:40.435
What is this thing?
Take it off! Take it off me right now!

00:33:48.234 --> 00:33:51.779
Since you refused my kindness,
I am proving my thread's worth.

00:33:53.197 --> 00:33:54.240
This is my thread's…

00:33:56.659 --> 00:33:57.535
use and power.

00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:24.228
Hunbish?

00:34:26.189 --> 00:34:27.690
You're still alive?

00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:34.280
So the boy who owned this body
was named Hunbish?

00:34:40.995 --> 00:34:42.038
Khalid.

00:34:46.793 --> 00:34:48.169
You're Khalid.

00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:54.926
How come you're…

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:56.385
How can this be?

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:01.516
Look! I've bound Shaytan!

00:35:02.141 --> 00:35:05.603
And this foreign girl loves another man.

00:35:05.686 --> 00:35:06.813
She loves Shaytan!

00:35:08.523 --> 00:35:09.524
What?

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:11.400
You didn't come for me.

00:35:11.484 --> 00:35:13.361
You came for him!

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:17.698
Get the bitch to her feet!

00:35:19.325 --> 00:35:20.326
Let go of me.

00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:21.953
Let go!

00:35:26.707 --> 00:35:30.294
Make that bitch stay by my side
for the rest of her life.

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:35.883
So this was the wish that I granted.

00:35:36.884 --> 00:35:37.885
No.

00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:44.809
I'm coming. I'll come to you.

00:35:46.435 --> 00:35:49.730
If I can't have her, no one can!

00:35:56.737 --> 00:35:57.572
No!

00:36:03.369 --> 00:36:04.537
No!

00:36:14.964 --> 00:36:15.965
I'm coming.

00:36:20.469 --> 00:36:22.388
No.

00:36:23.222 --> 00:36:24.515
Please, you can't.

00:36:35.818 --> 00:36:36.903
In Goryeo…

00:36:39.947 --> 00:36:40.907
No.

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:48.164
Everyone has four lives.

00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:53.419
Whichever life it may be…

00:36:57.048 --> 00:37:00.009
come and visit me in one of them.

00:37:01.177 --> 00:37:03.971
No, please. Just hang in there. Wait.

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:05.640
Just hold on.

00:37:13.272 --> 00:37:15.816
I am Genie, the lamp spirit.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.862
I shall grant you three wishes.

00:37:19.946 --> 00:37:24.951
Please, I request any of you
to become my master

00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:30.831
and use one of your wishes
to save this girl.

00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:34.126
I beg you!

00:37:34.877 --> 00:37:38.297
Whatever it is you desire,

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:43.344
I will fulfill
your second and third wishes.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.445
I will do it.

00:38:04.657 --> 00:38:07.118
Make me the richest man in the world.

00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:08.160
Richer than Muttalib!

00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:10.663
Please, no.

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:24.760
All right. Now, please.

00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:28.347
Before this girl takes her last breath…

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:32.935
Please!

00:38:33.936 --> 00:38:36.939
It works. It really works!

00:38:37.023 --> 00:38:39.025
- But this is not enough.
- No.

00:38:39.525 --> 00:38:42.153
I want more gold. More!

00:38:42.236 --> 00:38:45.197
No, this can't be.

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:57.209
Please. This is your final wish.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:01.255
Please use your last wish
to save this girl.

00:39:05.092 --> 00:39:07.928
Please!

00:39:13.392 --> 00:39:15.603
I want more gold, Genie.

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:18.439
Fill this entire city with gold!

00:39:20.107 --> 00:39:24.362
No, this can't be. Please.

00:39:24.445 --> 00:39:25.780
We want gold too!

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:27.323
Shower us with gold!

00:39:27.406 --> 00:39:28.532
This can't be.

00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:38.667
I'm sorry…

00:39:41.295 --> 00:39:44.090
for leaving you all alone.

00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:01.982
No!

00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:04.819
This can't be! No, please!

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:06.362
Please, no!

00:40:07.655 --> 00:40:08.656
No!

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:27.967
No, this can't be!

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:30.803
This can't be. Bring her back!

00:40:30.886 --> 00:40:34.348
Bring her back now! Please!

00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:44.859
No!

00:44:14.193 --> 00:44:18.614
Do you realize now how arrogant you were?

00:44:20.699 --> 00:44:21.950
At long last…

00:44:25.287 --> 00:44:26.705
that girl's

00:44:28.207 --> 00:44:29.541
final wish…

00:44:32.086 --> 00:44:33.212
was fulfilled.

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:40.469
This…

00:44:44.598 --> 00:44:46.308
was my punishment.

00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:52.189
I was almost sentenced to an eternal life,

00:44:52.272 --> 00:44:55.734
but thankfully,
faced death in another body.

00:44:56.568 --> 00:44:58.404
Then I became a wandering soul

00:44:59.279 --> 00:45:02.491
until I found you and my sister.

00:45:03.617 --> 00:45:07.037
Your punishment
has not yet come to an end,

00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:10.082
and you two are bound,
even in this life, by three wishes.

00:45:15.587 --> 00:45:16.547
That was…

00:45:19.007 --> 00:45:20.592
That was my doing yet again.

00:45:20.676 --> 00:45:27.057
And so, I return
this sad and beautiful story to you.

00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:30.644
Let your punishment for saving me be this.

00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:35.607
Whatever her final wish may be,
protect her,

00:45:35.691 --> 00:45:39.403
the one who was born to be wicked
yet still remains righteous.

00:45:46.618 --> 00:45:48.287
It is well overdue, but I apologize.

00:45:49.371 --> 00:45:53.459
You were also one of the more
admirable humans that I've ever met.

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:55.961
May your soul…

00:45:58.672 --> 00:46:00.090
find its way to peace.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.468
Whatever the punishment, I will take it.

00:47:28.428 --> 00:47:30.305
I will accept it willingly.

00:47:31.598 --> 00:47:32.766
I hope with all I have.

00:47:34.935 --> 00:47:38.397
Deliver whatever punishment
you see fit for my arrogance.

00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:41.275
I hope and plead.

00:47:42.276 --> 00:47:43.861
Of all I possess,

00:47:44.778 --> 00:47:47.573
take away anything
you see as more than I deserve.

00:47:49.324 --> 00:47:51.034
I hope against hope.

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.287
Just once.

00:47:54.913 --> 00:47:56.290
Please, just once.

00:47:58.083 --> 00:48:00.294
Allow me to visit one of her lives.

00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:04.256
Deliver whatever punishment you must,

00:48:05.257 --> 00:48:07.175
and take away whatever you must.

00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:10.304
But just once…

00:48:12.264 --> 00:48:15.517
Please, just once,
in whichever of her lives…

00:48:19.521 --> 00:48:22.774
Whatever the punishment, I will take it.

00:48:24.776 --> 00:48:27.070
I will accept it willingly.

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:34.745
Deliver whatever punishment
you see fit for my arrogance.

00:48:36.371 --> 00:48:38.081
Of all I possess…

00:49:02.814 --> 00:49:05.859
What are you saying? Pan-geum came where?

00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:07.444
She didn't come from anywhere.

00:49:07.527 --> 00:49:09.613
She never went to Hawaii
in the first place!

00:49:11.073 --> 00:49:12.991
Yes, is that you, Chang-sik?

00:49:13.075 --> 00:49:15.327
Hurry over to Pan-geum's house!

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.162
Just come when I tell you to!

00:49:19.414 --> 00:49:20.499
Follow me!

00:49:20.582 --> 00:49:22.542
- What is going on?
- Where are we going?

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:25.629
Oh my! What happened?
What's all the fuss about?

00:49:41.269 --> 00:49:42.729
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:44.815
Grand…

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:46.483
Mi-ju.

00:49:47.859 --> 00:49:49.695
What is it? Why are you crying?

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:52.823
Has something happened?

00:49:57.786 --> 00:50:01.581
My wisdom tooth just hurts so much.

00:50:12.551 --> 00:50:13.802
I'll take a look at her.

00:50:27.607 --> 00:50:29.109
You absolute witch!

00:50:29.901 --> 00:50:30.902
Mrs. Park.

00:50:30.986 --> 00:50:31.903
Mrs. Park!

00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:33.989
Hey! Where have you run off to?

00:50:34.072 --> 00:50:36.033
Oh Pan-geum! Come out here right now!

00:50:36.116 --> 00:50:38.994
If you have nothing to hide,
come out this instant and say so!

00:50:39.703 --> 00:50:41.204
Heung-rye, please.

00:50:41.288 --> 00:50:42.664
Goodness me!

00:50:42.748 --> 00:50:45.083
What in the world
did you sacrifice to get that way?

00:50:45.167 --> 00:50:48.336
What in the world did you sacrifice
to get so young all on your own?

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.629
- Come on.
- Mrs. Park!

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:51.673
Nobody's even home!
What's gotten into you?

00:50:51.757 --> 00:50:54.718
- Let go of me!
- Please just try to calm down!

00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:55.635
Let go of me!

00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:59.222
I'm telling you, Oh Pan-geum
must be using witchcraft or something

00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:01.516
because she's become
a young lady. You hear?

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.853
Hey! I want to be young again too!
Me too, okay?

00:51:04.936 --> 00:51:07.105
- No one's getting younger!
- Get out of there.

00:51:07.189 --> 00:51:09.149
- Let go of me!
- You're not making any sense.

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:12.194
Deacon An, just stay back.
Please, it's dangerous.

00:51:12.778 --> 00:51:15.280
Deacon? Is there even a god?

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:20.327
If there is, there is no way
that he would let me become so miserable!

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:23.580
My old age makes me miserable!

00:51:23.663 --> 00:51:27.292
Goodness me, I got so damn old
in the blink of an eye!

00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:30.921
Lord have mercy!

00:51:32.172 --> 00:51:34.716
Right, this bitch. That's where she'll be.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.510
- The fields!
- Where are you going now?

00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:43.350
Don't get out.

00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:47.395
- I'll deal with the witch myself!
- Chang-sik, please get up!

00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:49.022
She'll be in the onion field!

00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:50.357
You'll get yourself hurt!

00:51:50.899 --> 00:51:53.443
Calm down. Please calm down!

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:58.031
Pan-geum is in Hawaii.
Why would she be in the onion field?

00:51:58.115 --> 00:51:59.116
Shut up!

00:52:13.922 --> 00:52:14.840
Heung-rye.

00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:35.861
You damn bastard! Get out!

00:52:36.736 --> 00:52:37.737
Get out of the car!

00:52:39.281 --> 00:52:40.574
- Get out!
- Get out!

00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:42.117
Get out of the car!

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.869
What the hell are you doing, punk?

00:52:43.952 --> 00:52:44.995
Get out--

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.292
Is this the police?

00:52:52.085 --> 00:52:53.378
I've just run someone over.

00:52:54.421 --> 00:52:57.382
Ishrun. You know what to do, right?

00:52:57.465 --> 00:52:59.301
I think she's dead.

00:53:00.093 --> 00:53:01.344
We're just outside

00:53:02.804 --> 00:53:04.431
Ms. Ki Ka-young's house.

00:56:36.976 --> 00:56:41.981

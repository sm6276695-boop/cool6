GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.539
You spent the night out? Where did you go?

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:24.292
I clearly told you
that I'd just change my clothes, and…

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.593
What's wrong? What happened?

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:39.474
A Mongolian boy paid me a visit.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.187
He gave me back my memories.

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:47.941
I caused you…

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:53.988
My arrogance made you…

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.825
I found out about everything.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.919
That doesn't matter anymore.
That's just the past.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.838
We're here now.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:12.757
You said you can't resurrect the dead
or take us to the future.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.635
But actually, it was the future just now.

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:19.013
Just now and just now. And just now again.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.642
Let's go together.

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:27.063
Not to the past that's set,
but to the future we can change.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.444
Even if we don't know how it will end.

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:41.870
All right.

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:45.206
Let's do that.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.796
CHOI DA-JIN
ENTER PASSWORD

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:53.798
INCORRECT PASSWORD

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:58.011
So you don't remember the password at all?

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:01.556
Stop joking around.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.809
I'm not joking. It's killing me too.
I honestly have no clue.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:07.520
Can't you use
two-step verification to reset it?

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:11.566
I guess I didn't register my number.
I'm not getting the codes.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.109
Da-jin.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.654
Come on, stop messing with me, seriously!

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:20.450
This is driving me insane too!
It's like I've lost my memory!

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.162
Like you've lost your memory?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.706
Memory?

00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:31.169
So she doesn't remember a thing
about the wishes. Every single detail.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:35.048
That's why…

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.593
she's forgotten the password?

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.639
What do we do about our videos?

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.308
Yeong-hyeon, I'm sorry.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.894
Why did I do that?

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.104
Why on earth did I change the password?

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:54.317
Our wedding anniversary, your birthday,

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:59.280
the day I first met you,
the day you proposed… It's none of those.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.868
So, your passwords

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.662
were all things like that?

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:09.207
I must be out of my mind.
How could I forget this?

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:19.217
INCORRECT PASSWORD

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.229
Da-jin.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.147
I'll make sure

00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:34.857
your dad

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.026
gets better.

00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:40.780
What? What are you talking about?

00:04:42.156 --> 00:04:43.992
Where are you going?

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:49.622
Ka-young.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.626
What's with you? What is all this?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.546
Who is that bastard?
That jerk named you when he surrendered--

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.298
It's all right. It's all okay.

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.258
It will all be all right.

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:03.386
For now, let's go. You too, Min-ji.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.848
You both need to remain in hiding
from now on. I know a secure place.

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:09.726
Sure. Lunatics like him
don't deserve the time of day.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.602
Running away is the right thing to do.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:15.315
Let's finish talking when we get there.
Where is it? Is it far?

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.698
About Heung-rye's funeral…

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.660
I'll make a generous gift.
For now, take this and get some sleep.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:32.332
I have something I need to do.
It must be done for everything to be okay.

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.792
So even if it gets stifling,

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.421
make sure you stay here, Grandma. Okay?

00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:40.256
All right.

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:42.800
Be careful, okay?

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:44.844
You'll go with her, won't you?

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.806
Yes. Don't worry, Oh Pan-geum.
I'll stay by her side.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.483
The thing I said I'd tell you later--

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.860
Forget it. You don't need to tell me.

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.237
I already know it's Grandma.

00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:06.616
I'll consider this a housewarming
and get comfy.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.327
I see you've made yourself at home.

00:06:09.827 --> 00:06:11.496
Your dinner delivery has arrived.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.667
If you need anything, tell him.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.587
Sade, protect them with your life.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.297
Yes, Master. Leave it to me.

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:23.841
Want jjajang or jjamppong?

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:29.347
A genie, a beast, and a lamp
that's like a luxury Banpo Xi apartment.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.226
Despite all of this magic,
I must make it clear where I stand.

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:35.269
My vote is still on evolution.

00:06:39.982 --> 00:06:42.693
Right, about that.

00:06:43.444 --> 00:06:45.279
That deserves its own conversation.

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.490
Why don't you take something
and sleep it off?

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:48.408
I could just…

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.663
- Kim Ha-neul, did you find your toy?
- Yes.

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:56.207
See? Daddy told you it would turn up.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.543
But you had to cry and make a fuss.

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.421
Where was it? We couldn't find it
when we were looking for it.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:04.924
Ppoppi told me where it was.

00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:07.927
How could Ppoppi tell you?
Mommy told you he went to America.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.345
It's true.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:12.014
Ppoppi told me when he came last time.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.141
He whispered it to me.

00:07:16.727 --> 00:07:17.854
What's wrong?

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.280
I, a former member
of the Reconnaissance Unit,

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.532
inherited an enormous sum of money

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:31.951
from an anonymous person.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.246
But I don't remember anything.

00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:39.333
In situations like these, there are
three options. The first option is to…

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:40.251
Report it.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.588
The second is…

00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:45.715
NEAT STACK SAFE

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.425
Stash it.

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:52.388
The third and final option is…

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.985
So you've been abandoned too.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.322
Do you want to come with me?

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.700
My house is full of your friends.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:17.747
Before any of that,
what should we call you?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.667
Ppoppi.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.296
Yes, Ppoppi sounds good.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.133
Chauffeur Choi?

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:33.804
Let's get going, shall we?

00:08:36.557 --> 00:08:38.476
I chose the third option.

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:41.103
It's strange, and I miss it.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.106
I feel like I will forever be waiting.

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:48.444
Even the anonymous have names.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.197
I, now an abandoned dog detective,

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:55.034
am on my way to find those of you
who have abandoned your pet dogs.

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:05.378
Have you still not made up your mind?

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.588
That won't do, will it?

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.055
I'm not sure what you're playing at
by holding out like this,

00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:20.059
but all you need to do
is put the world to sleep immediately.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:27.149
Obey Father's orders
so that he can bind Iblis.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:34.991
The door is open.

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:04.854
You total psycho.
What the hell are you doing?

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.650
I'll give you all of this money.
Sell me your final wish.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.029
If you don't sell it, I'll burn it all.

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:16.407
I'm sure you're aware
that I will actually set it on fire.

00:10:17.908 --> 00:10:22.038
Whatever wish you make,
I will simply wish to undo it.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.457
So just sell it to me.

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.459
I'm asking you to please…

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.796
choose the money, Gu Bo-gyeong.

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:38.220
Why would I trust you?

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:41.682
We don't need to trust each other.
We need rules.

00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:43.726
I follow rules, no matter what.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.229
You hand over your wish,
and I hand you this money.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.481
That would be it.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.232
This would be our rule.

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.040
What do I need to wish for?

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.114
I'll make my final wish.

00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:44.620
Go and tell Ki Ka-young
that I made the wish exactly as she asked.

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:08.602
In your past life, you sold hundreds
of lives to buy your way into heaven.

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:12.481
Now, in this life, you're still
causing trouble for others, Ms. Ki.

00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:14.734
A bit rich coming from you.

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:16.861
You scared an eight-year-old

00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:19.655
into using her final wish
to confine Iblis.

00:12:20.948 --> 00:12:23.784
And you're still doing that
in this life. Get lost.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.703
I simply stated the facts.

00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:27.621
Not all facts tell the truth.

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:29.165
It's a pity,

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:32.376
but no matter what you do,
I will slit Iblis's throat.

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:36.172
I followed his orders
and bowed before humans.

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:39.216
Iblis, however,
rebelled against his every word.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.426
Not once

00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:42.887
has he obeyed his orders willingly.

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:47.224
The only reason
he continues to forgive Shaytan

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.226
is so I may slit his throat.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.395
That means that my slitting Iblis's throat

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:55.691
is something he will truly rejoice in.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.783
What's with the engineering student logic?
My arm hurts.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:07.328
See here, Mr. Angel.

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:09.997
That thing you're doing right now?

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.625
It's called envy. An inferiority complex.

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:14.502
It is greater than that.

00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:17.797
- My will aligns with his--
- Don't hide behind him!

00:13:18.672 --> 00:13:22.009
You will never slit Iblis's throat.
Do you know why?

00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:26.722
Because I will make
an incredibly selfish final wish.

00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:30.142
I was…

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:33.771
always…

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.608
born evil.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.071
JOY

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:29.034
DESPAIR

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.330
LONGING

00:14:33.414 --> 00:14:34.832
WAITING

00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:40.546
MIN-JI'S EMOTIONS ARE SO EASY

00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:42.631
RULE: NEVER SNEER AT PEOPLE LIKE THIS

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:46.510
I knew you'd take a peek
eventually, you Satan.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:49.138
Turn it off when you're done.
Electricity is not free.

00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:00.065
Did you meet Gu Bo-gyeong?

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:01.775
She still seems to remember.

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:05.404
Did she do it?
Did she make her final wish?

00:15:06.655 --> 00:15:08.324
She did. As did Ko Yeong-hyeon.

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:10.159
Human kindness

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:12.578
is very surprising.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.246
They weren't corrupt.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.207
Really?

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:19.418
Hey, wake up.

00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:21.921
Ko Yeong-hyeon, wake up, will you?

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.465
How did you know? Tell me how.

00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:28.010
Hey, what's wrong? Why are you crying?

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.178
What did I know?

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:31.764
Before you left,
you said you'd make Dad better.

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:35.017
I just heard that my dad's
cancer cells have disappeared.

00:15:35.517 --> 00:15:37.811
No one knows why.
The doctors say it's a miracle!

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:38.979
- Wait, really?
- Yes!

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:40.564
Hey, that's amazing news!

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:42.483
Hold up.

00:15:42.983 --> 00:15:46.612
Did I really say
something like that? When?

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.573
Thank you, Yeong-hyeon.

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:52.326
It's as if your words made him better.

00:15:52.826 --> 00:15:53.994
Like some kind of magic.

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:56.330
It's okay. Hey, your phone.

00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:57.331
Right.

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:00.542
Hi, Dad.

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:02.795
I was just telling him.

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:04.421
What?

00:16:05.172 --> 00:16:07.716
Slow down. What's blowing up your phone?

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:12.888
Two-step verification codes
for a YouTube account? They went to you?

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:13.973
What codes…

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:16.600
Dad, you'll get another code now.
Read it out to me.

00:16:17.267 --> 00:16:20.312
Yeong-hyeon, we can restore
all of our videos.

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:22.648
We have almost over 600,000 views now!

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:25.484
- Yes.
- Six hundred… thousand?

00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:29.571
Did you just say
our video has over 600,000 views?

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.075
- Hey!
- What?

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:35.452
- Did you flash your chest?
- What?

00:16:36.286 --> 00:16:38.288
You scumbag. Come here, you.

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:40.332
- Hey, I'm sorry!
- That's your first thought?

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:43.544
So does that mean I won't be dying

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:45.838
because of our bet?

00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:49.758
I say we should count
Gu Bo-gyeong's final wish as 0.5,

00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:52.928
and I'll try to argue the point
that it's 2.5 to 2.5.

00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:58.308
I'm heading off now.
Make sure you come to save me, Master.

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:02.813
Right now?

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:04.815
Already?

00:17:04.898 --> 00:17:07.234
Since the dawn of time,
the first to strike has won.

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.153
Don't worry.

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.447
I've never lost to anyone except you…

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:53.030
Knowing that one of them
must be destroyed,

00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:57.743
I see Iblis has come to entertain
the impossible hope that both might live.

00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:00.996
As it stands now,
both Iblis and Ms. Ki Ka-young

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:03.332
will try to save each other.

00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:07.628
That certainly seems the case
for Ki Ka-young.

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:13.133
Then I won't be able to finish this war.

00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:16.470
Did you say war?

00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:49.711
Please, child. Stop.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:53.215
I will put the world to sleep
and bind Iblis.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.510
The day has finally come.

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.471
It's today?
Is today finally the day, Father?

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:02.015
That's why I will do the binding.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.310
I no longer heal when cut by this thread.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.277
I can simply not fall asleep.

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:16.280
Khalid!

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.875
All right. Now sing!

00:19:34.464 --> 00:19:35.841
Iblis has come willingly.

00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:39.428
Father, sing.

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:40.554
I said sing!

00:19:57.362 --> 00:19:59.907
When that day comes,
there is something you must do.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.492
That's all you need to do.
Am I understood?

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.939
We meet at last.

00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:35.067
I have waited 1,000 years for you.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.861
So you really had to go this far.

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:41.406
I received something invaluable today.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.658
Thank you, Father.

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:52.334
Now, my son, will you grant me freedom?

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:53.794
Yes, that's right.

00:20:53.877 --> 00:20:55.003
But

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.131
I'd rather take that freedom for myself.

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:00.425
Shadi!

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:10.143
Don't forget my last request, Iblis.

00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:17.109
This was, I'm afraid,

00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:19.695
the best I could do, my brother.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.037
You do not possess the soul of a human

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:33.000
nor the generosity of a spirit.

00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:35.711
You will…

00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:39.089
die by my hands.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:40.966
Are you angry?

00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:44.511
Aren't you being too harsh
on an orphan who can't hear?

00:21:48.765 --> 00:21:51.018
What about that bitch? Do you have her?

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:16.001
It's time for you to make your final wish.

00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:17.919
Where is the lamp?

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:20.547
Refusing will only harm
the ones you care about.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.134
Your grandma, your friend,
your village neighbors.

00:22:24.634 --> 00:22:27.637
Will you wish to transfer ownership
of the lamp to me, friend?

00:22:28.138 --> 00:22:29.681
So this is a zero-sum game.

00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:32.559
Fine.

00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:35.228
Enough with the faux friendship.

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:39.358
Just knock yourself the fuck out.

00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:40.984
In quotes.

00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:42.611
What are you saying?

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:44.654
Where the hell is the lamp?

00:22:48.658 --> 00:22:51.078
What the hell? Where did she go?

00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:53.997
That crazy bitch
just wasted her final wish like this?

00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:56.291
Find her at once!

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:57.334
Yes.

00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:03.548
What do I need to wish for?

00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:05.217
Whatever the day or the moment,

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.179
when Ki Ka-young says,
"Just knock yourself the fuck out,"

00:23:10.138 --> 00:23:12.599
take Ki Ka-young to Iblis's side.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.726
That's what you'll wish for.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.269
Did you get that?

00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:17.771
What do you take me for?

00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:47.509
Damn it. They really tied you up good.

00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:56.435
This is the extent of my plans.

00:23:57.394 --> 00:23:58.395
What do we do now?

00:23:58.478 --> 00:24:01.273
This is where my plans start.
For starters, we have thread.

00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:04.901
With that thread in hand,
I'll head to my brother's garden.

00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:07.737
You two, follow me.
Everyone else, spread out!

00:24:08.321 --> 00:24:09.322
Hurry and find her!

00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:14.035
He's half-human, half-spirit.
That thread is fatal to him too.

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:15.745
Though I'm not sure I can carry it.

00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:18.165
Carry it.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.215
Don't worry about me. Just go.
Go get rid of the immortal one.

00:24:44.774 --> 00:24:49.488
Oh my, I feel sick. I think we're being
taken somewhere else right now.

00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:58.288
What could be happening?
I'll go and check things out.

00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:10.217
Who are you? Another mythical beast?

00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:15.013
Irem.

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.770
This is a gift from Ejllael.

00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:23.271
A gift?

00:25:29.736 --> 00:25:30.695
This must be it.

00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:33.949
This is Iblis's lamp.

00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:37.869
Irem, what did you just do?

00:25:37.953 --> 00:25:40.997
I told you to do what's right by you.

00:25:41.498 --> 00:25:43.250
I'm just following my master's orders.

00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:45.418
This is what Ejllael ordered? Why exactly?

00:25:45.502 --> 00:25:47.837
We do not question our masters' orders.

00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:49.798
We simply obey.

00:25:53.677 --> 00:25:54.719
Irem!

00:25:58.348 --> 00:26:00.267
How come I can still see this?

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:04.729
It's meant to disappear
once you've made your three wishes.

00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:08.775
She deceived me.

00:26:09.276 --> 00:26:11.152
There's one wish left!

00:26:13.363 --> 00:26:14.239
That bitch.

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:16.908
Go find her.

00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:19.452
Find her, whatever it takes. Hurry!

00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:20.370
Yes!

00:26:20.453 --> 00:26:21.329
Stop right there!

00:26:23.832 --> 00:26:25.041
I'll kill you all.

00:26:34.342 --> 00:26:36.928
The day you find dead birds
on the roads for no reason,

00:26:37.512 --> 00:26:38.680
that is the day.

00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:40.307
Please come to save us.

00:27:58.259 --> 00:27:59.844
You're not here to see me, are you?

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:08.019
I'm in the middle of something.

00:28:11.439 --> 00:28:13.566
Ki Ka-young will soon be
making her final wish.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.111
I thought I'd try
to buy some time until then.

00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:18.446
If you strike that flower before then,

00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:21.658
it would destroy my plans.

00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:24.160
About your painting.

00:28:26.579 --> 00:28:28.498
You asked why I took the angels' eyes.

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:31.668
They were full of desire.

00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:35.672
And I see this is the desire I sensed.

00:28:37.173 --> 00:28:39.134
For you, the 300-year war

00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:40.885
isn't over.

00:28:40.969 --> 00:28:43.179
Did you really believe that war was over?

00:28:43.763 --> 00:28:45.932
Did that war bring an end to anything?

00:28:46.766 --> 00:28:49.060
That is why
you shouldn't have removed that sword.

00:28:49.769 --> 00:28:52.272
The very sword that annihilated us angels.

00:28:52.856 --> 00:28:55.984
You should never
have met her again either.

00:28:57.402 --> 00:29:00.905
Now you've recovered your memories,
you must know how things ended.

00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:05.660
I hope Ki Ka-young's wish
will be righteous.

00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:07.495
Then I will slit your throat

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:10.749
and put her back
to the way she always was.

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:14.377
She will forget you
and return to the hell she once lived in,

00:29:14.461 --> 00:29:15.837
condemned as a psychopath.

00:29:17.172 --> 00:29:19.549
Because that is the appropriate fate
for a human

00:29:19.632 --> 00:29:21.009
who was loved by Satan.

00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:24.345
In her previous life and now.

00:29:26.055 --> 00:29:27.599
I also hope, more than anyone…

00:29:29.642 --> 00:29:31.811
that her last wish will be righteous.

00:29:32.562 --> 00:29:34.105
She may have been born evil,

00:29:34.856 --> 00:29:37.650
but she lived a dull life
to avoid bad choices.

00:29:39.569 --> 00:29:41.946
I hope the rest of her life is heaven.

00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:44.574
Of course she would forget me

00:29:46.034 --> 00:29:49.120
and go back to her normal life,
being condemned as a psychopath.

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.247
And her life may be dull,

00:29:52.749 --> 00:29:54.501
but she would be a righteous human,

00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:57.420
worthy of love, just as he intended.

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:01.841
I'm sure that's why we were reunited.

00:30:04.427 --> 00:30:05.887
So that the end of this war…

00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:09.557
may be Ki Ka-young's heaven.

00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:19.859
So you, too, must bow.

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:21.778
Bow before her.

00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:41.089

PARK CHANG-SIK

00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:55.144
Operation Cave Cleaning.

00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:03.695
From grit to grit.

00:31:03.778 --> 00:31:06.823
If it won't do, make it do.
If it won't work, make it work.

00:31:09.075 --> 00:31:11.995
All right, let's go!

00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:42.961
Who are you? How did you get in here?

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.380
Are you another one of those things?

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:47.215
I'm sorry, I can't hear.

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:50.301
Your granddaughter's
waiting for you outside.

00:32:50.385 --> 00:32:52.095
My Ka-young is here?

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:55.181
But who are you?

00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:57.141
Where did you get it?

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:58.851
That thread.

00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:25.086
Grandma, no matter what,
don't let go of my hand.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.423
What the hell are you blabbering about?
Look at me.

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:29.507
I said look at me!

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.637
Your granddaughter made my father mad,

00:33:34.721 --> 00:33:36.723
so I think it's time to drop some corpses.

00:33:37.306 --> 00:33:40.184
Which order would be the most threatening?

00:33:40.268 --> 00:33:44.147
I guess the friend first
and then blood relations, right?

00:33:44.814 --> 00:33:46.065
Kill her first.

00:33:47.567 --> 00:33:48.901
Who are you people?

00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:51.320
What is all this?

00:33:59.787 --> 00:34:00.621
Father!

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:02.040
Father!

00:34:06.794 --> 00:34:08.171
It must be today.

00:34:09.756 --> 00:34:11.507
Not next spring.

00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:13.551
Grandma, try breaking the thread.

00:34:14.927 --> 00:34:15.928
What the…

00:34:17.764 --> 00:34:20.725
When the plum blossoms
next bloom in your garden…

00:34:20.808 --> 00:34:21.684
Good heavens.

00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:22.935
…you will die.

00:34:23.436 --> 00:34:24.270
What is it?

00:34:26.355 --> 00:34:27.190
Min-ji.

00:34:27.273 --> 00:34:31.444
Make sure you tell my dear Ka-young
everything I tell you now.

00:34:33.446 --> 00:34:34.697
Ka-young.

00:34:35.531 --> 00:34:38.534
Raising you was such a blessing.

00:34:39.285 --> 00:34:42.038
You got good grades, you're beautiful,

00:34:42.538 --> 00:34:44.749
and not once did you do anything wrong.

00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:46.417
So, whatever you do,

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:50.171
you must not make
a bad choice because of me.

00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:51.839
Tell her that, will you?

00:34:53.549 --> 00:34:55.343
Sure, but for now, let's run.

00:34:57.345 --> 00:34:58.179
Father!

00:34:58.930 --> 00:34:59.764
Father!

00:35:17.573 --> 00:35:18.574
Mr. Seo I-deuk!

00:35:20.576 --> 00:35:21.577
Kill her!

00:35:22.203 --> 00:35:23.663
Min-ji!

00:35:34.715 --> 00:35:36.676
A strange thing for a boy to have.

00:35:46.435 --> 00:35:48.312
I made the plum blossoms bloom

00:35:49.063 --> 00:35:51.315
in the garden with my own hands.

00:35:57.363 --> 00:35:59.907
Grandma, no!

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:03.244
Mi-ju, please! No!

00:36:04.287 --> 00:36:07.498
Mi-ju, no! This can't be!

00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:10.293
This is the wrong order!

00:36:10.376 --> 00:36:12.003
I said this bitch goes first!

00:36:16.048 --> 00:36:17.967
- No!
- You psycho bitch!

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.261
Spit it out. Spit it out right now!

00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:22.763
Open her up.

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:25.725
- Take the thread out!
- Please don't do that. Please!

00:36:25.808 --> 00:36:27.560
Please!

00:36:27.643 --> 00:36:28.978
No!

00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:49.207
Sade.

00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:29.830
Grandma.

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:31.916
Grandma?

00:37:31.999 --> 00:37:33.459
Grandma, she…

00:37:33.542 --> 00:37:34.752
Because of me, she…

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:43.219
You can't die, Grandma!

00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:45.263
You can't just leave me!

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:49.141
As long as she's still breathing.
The lamp.

00:37:49.225 --> 00:37:50.518
Where is the lamp?

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:53.521
You need to use your last wish on me.

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:56.065
This bitch has already stopped breathing.

00:37:56.148 --> 00:37:57.566
Don't hold out too long,

00:37:58.234 --> 00:37:59.777
or that bitch dies too.

00:38:01.237 --> 00:38:04.532
But before that, we'll slice
this bitch open and take my thread out.

00:38:05.032 --> 00:38:06.867
She swallowed my thread, you see.

00:38:12.206 --> 00:38:13.791
No!

00:38:13.874 --> 00:38:16.627
No! Don't!

00:38:21.257 --> 00:38:22.508
Come on in!

00:38:31.183 --> 00:38:32.351
Let's go!

00:38:44.905 --> 00:38:46.365
Drag her down to the basement!

00:38:46.949 --> 00:38:47.992
Let go of me!

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:04.842
Dr. Choi, get it together.
Help me take her.

00:39:22.443 --> 00:39:25.654
You had the chance to kill me, so why?

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.579
Why didn't you kill me?

00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:36.707
You still have a job to do.

00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:40.294
You need to come and slit my throat.

00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:44.548
Move aside.

00:39:55.184 --> 00:39:56.102
Please, Brother.

00:39:57.645 --> 00:39:59.188
End my son's life.

00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:05.027
That is the reason I walked all night
to find and bind you.

00:40:07.196 --> 00:40:09.031
I beg of you, my brother.

00:40:17.331 --> 00:40:20.084
You fucking bastard, I'll kill you!

00:40:20.167 --> 00:40:22.002
Call on Iblis!

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:24.338
Use your final wish
to transfer the lamp to me!

00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:25.756
Make the wish for me!

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.593
I would rather make this decision
than transfer my wish.

00:40:33.139 --> 00:40:36.016
You psycho bitch, do you want to die?

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.185
Kill me. Go on!

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:41.063
Yeah? Then I'll kill you myself.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.239
I saw it.

00:40:50.322 --> 00:40:53.492
A thousand years ago, when you were dying,

00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:58.581
Iblis revealed the lamp himself
to save you.

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:03.878
Please use one of your wishes
to save this girl.

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:06.505
Please, I beg you!

00:41:16.182 --> 00:41:20.311
It would be nice
for such a moment to come once more.

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:21.854
Come, Iblis!

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:51.550
Father!

00:41:51.634 --> 00:41:52.927
Father.

00:41:53.427 --> 00:41:55.179
No!

00:41:55.262 --> 00:41:56.347
Father!

00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:25.125
So the thing you longed for

00:42:26.001 --> 00:42:27.670
was this war.

00:42:30.839 --> 00:42:31.674
No.

00:42:33.259 --> 00:42:34.718
The thing I longed for…

00:42:38.097 --> 00:42:39.348
was victory.

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:49.316
Father?

00:42:49.817 --> 00:42:50.776
Father!

00:42:52.987 --> 00:42:54.113
I'll kill you!

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.049
Are you okay? Are you hurt at all?

00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:15.926
Grandma was…

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:17.595
Grandma and Sade are…

00:44:04.224 --> 00:44:06.602
The individual had no breath
or pulse upon rescue.

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:09.188
Clean with no visible trauma.

00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:11.440
Let's contact the Jeil Hospital ER--

00:44:11.523 --> 00:44:12.358
No.

00:44:13.025 --> 00:44:15.277
Let's go straight to the funeral home.

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:19.239
She's dead.

00:44:19.823 --> 00:44:20.741
I know that.

00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:24.787
But legally, a doctor must pronounce
the death before any funeral arrangements.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.873
- We need to confirm her identity.
- I know her.

00:44:27.956 --> 00:44:29.708
And according to the law…

00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:33.754
dentists can also pronounce someone dead.

00:44:35.547 --> 00:44:36.715
Ms. Oh Pan-geum.

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:39.718
Time of death.

00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:41.970
October 5th…

00:44:47.059 --> 00:44:48.560
at 18:23.

00:44:51.146 --> 00:44:52.523
She has passed.

00:45:10.749 --> 00:45:13.836
I will now also give you sorrow

00:45:17.506 --> 00:45:20.634
I will give you sorrow
More precious than love

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:28.809
Other genie, what does Oh Pan-geum
ask the most besides the weather?

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:32.354
Ms. Oh Pan-geum searched the following.

00:45:32.438 --> 00:45:36.442
Ways to heal my dear Ka-young's illness.

00:45:36.525 --> 00:45:40.362
How to fix a psychopath.
Foods that are good for psychopaths.

00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:45.909
An old woman who had laid
A few tangerines on the street

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.537
KA-YOUNG, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL TODAY AS ALWAYS

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:51.457
Shivering from a lifetime of cold
On a winter's night

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.500
FROM SORROW TO JOY
POETRY BY JEONG HO-SEUNG

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:56.837
To you, who rejoiced as you haggled
The price of tangerines

00:46:03.177 --> 00:46:06.930
I shall show you sorrow's equal face

00:46:16.023 --> 00:46:18.776
When I called out to you from the darkness

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:25.574
Please leave.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.994
We will wash and dress the deceased.

00:46:29.578 --> 00:46:30.496
Please leave.

00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:34.041
Not once did you show me an equal smile

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.922
When a frozen corpse
Froze yet again under a straw sack

00:46:40.005 --> 00:46:42.257
GRANDCHILD: KI KA-YOUNG

00:46:43.842 --> 00:46:46.470
You did not so much
As cover it with another sack

00:46:52.601 --> 00:46:55.187
For your indifferent love

00:46:56.939 --> 00:46:59.983
For your tears
That seem incapable of flowing

00:47:04.404 --> 00:47:05.322
It's uncomfortable.

00:47:05.405 --> 00:47:08.826
I will now also give you waiting

00:47:11.203 --> 00:47:14.248
Just put up with it for today.

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.292
You must.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.170
Every decision I made
was for our happiness.

00:47:22.548 --> 00:47:24.299
But because Grandma just died,

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.802
this is all so uncomfortable right now!

00:47:26.885 --> 00:47:28.220
You're uncomfortable?

00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:32.391
You feel uncomfortable
about making the wrong call?

00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:34.101
What about me?

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:38.814
I lost Grandma, and…

00:47:42.234 --> 00:47:44.111
Though it was only a short while, I…

00:47:55.747 --> 00:47:57.124
So you tough it out too.

00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:02.588
So if I decide something…

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.842
it makes everyone unhappy like this.

00:48:08.093 --> 00:48:09.261
Be my friend.

00:48:09.344 --> 00:48:11.930
What happens if I say I don't want to?

00:48:12.514 --> 00:48:14.725
You and me, we're both negative ones.

00:48:14.808 --> 00:48:16.018
You don't have a choice.

00:48:16.643 --> 00:48:18.604
Multiply us, and we'll be at least one.

00:48:19.104 --> 00:48:20.480
That's why we're friends.

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:24.359
I really am a negative one.

00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:33.118
Your mom sent this
to cover the cost of the funeral.

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:40.167
I will put an end to the heavy snow
That once fell on this world

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:45.339
You said you were going
to a better place than Hawaii.

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:48.425
How could you come back to us like this?

00:48:48.508 --> 00:48:52.304
Goodness me.

00:48:56.308 --> 00:48:58.101
Goodness, what to do?

00:49:09.655 --> 00:49:12.449
I will take the spring snow
That fell on the barley fields

00:49:13.951 --> 00:49:17.037
And visit the sorrows of the people
Shivering with cold

00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:23.126
I will walk the snowy paths with you

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.505
Where it no longer snows

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:38.058
Would you look at that?

00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:41.144
She's like that
even at her grandma's funeral?

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:44.731
She sure is strange.
She hasn't shed a single tear.

00:49:51.863 --> 00:49:54.700
Must you act strange on a day like this?

00:49:55.367 --> 00:49:57.869
This is why I said
Gyeong-seok should hold her picture!

00:50:01.039 --> 00:50:03.458
Mom.

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:07.379
Mom!

00:50:17.723 --> 00:50:20.183
We will talk of the power of sorrow

00:50:23.061 --> 00:50:24.688
And walk all the way

00:50:26.064 --> 00:50:27.357
To the sorrow of waiting

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:01.905

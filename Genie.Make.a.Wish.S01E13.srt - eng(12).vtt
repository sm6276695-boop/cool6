GENIE, MAKE A WISH

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.322
KI KA-YOUNG
I STILL CAN'T REACH YOU

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.948
CAN YOU CALL ME? IT'S URGENT

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:17.077
JULY 19
I'M GETTING TRANSFERS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.120
SEPTEMBER 15
ARE YOU TRYING TO FUCK ME OVER?

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.581
NOTICE OF DISMISSAL

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:23.666
PLEASE RETURN YOUR ID
AND YOUR LOCKER AND BUILDING KEYS

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.798
I'm here to take your meter readings.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.383
Is anyone home?

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:36.471
This is driving me crazy.

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:38.056
For fuck's sake.

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:40.767
Where did all that money come from?

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.478
Why is it here?

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.208
I'm not out of breath.
Not even close to exhausted.

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.123
STOP TAKING THE SLEEPING PILLS

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.959
JUST TAKE 1 VITAMIN
AND GET LOTS OF SUNSHINE

00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:39.719
Even if you're feeling lazy,
try to cook your meals.

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:42.138
The pipes freeze when it gets cold out,

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.349
so make sure to wrap them
with old clothes.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.936
My darling Ka-young,
you're beautiful today as always.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.815
My dear bundle of joy, be well.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.661
I know you're in a bad place right now,
but please help me.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.417
There's a bag full of cash in my house.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.503
I don't know how it ended up in my hands,

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.422
but I saw you with it
on Choi Min-ji's Instagram.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.345
It's yours, isn't it?

00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:25.139
Did I, by chance,

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.184
steal your money?

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.939
It's just that I really can't remember.

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:36.442
But knowing me, I could have.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.404
I envied you
and hoped you would be ruined.

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:44.951
If I really did do that…

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.246
I'm truly sorry.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.875
That money is yours.

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.713
You sold me something invaluable.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.340
You helped someone.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:01.884
But I wasn't able to save them.

00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:04.887
So use it however you want.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:08.933
No, the last few days
have been absolute hell for me.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.810
I was scared someone would come for it,

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:13.187
but reporting it to the cops
seemed like a waste.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:15.315
Not that I could bring myself to use it.

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:19.736
So please, just take it all back.

00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:22.864
But about me being fired,

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.283
could you help clear things up?

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.744
All I want…

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.206
is to live as I was before.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.585
The genie was right.

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:40.923
I corrupted you.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:15.917
Grandma said that?

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:18.294
Yes.

00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:22.757
She wanted me to tell you

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:24.717
she was happy to raise you.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.804
I should have told you at the funeral.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.391
I'm sorry.

00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:33.476
For what I said then.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.270
At the time…

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.028
- You'll forgive me, won't you?
- Yes.

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.744
- Did you say you've done it all?
- Of course.

00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:54.247
I accomplished everything.

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.625
First, university.
Then, I became a dentist.

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:00.128
But why do you ask?

00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:03.423
Grandma was happy while raising me.

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:06.217
You've accomplished everything.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:09.720
I also

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.056
want to do it all.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:16.894
What do you want to do?

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.776
What could you possibly want to do?

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.723
Ka-young!

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:40.102
Ka-young, no! Don't go, Ka-young!

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.691
Hey, don't leave me behind!

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:49.987
Ka-young!

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:51.489
No.

00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:00.891
Come on out, Iblis!

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.310
Show yourself!

00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:08.107
You said you could never leave me!

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.566
Come out!

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:53.194
I said show yourself!

00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:55.905
Come out, Iblis!

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:57.573
Show yourself!

00:10:59.408 --> 00:11:01.243
Where are you?

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:04.080
Why have you disappeared? Why?

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:23.307
Iblis.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:26.435
I said show yourself.

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:42.827
Iblis!

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:12.565
What took you so long?
Do you know how long I searched for you?

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.734
Why didn't you answer me?

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.194
You should've come when I called.

00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:23.659
You're a genie.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.705
You still need to grant my final wish.

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:33.919
- I will…
- Don't do it.

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:37.339
I'll make an incredibly selfish wish.
Just for me.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.178
Ki Ka-young, please.

00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:46.474
I want to understand my grandma's pain,
raising a stone as if it were a jewel.

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:52.521
I want to know the fear my neighbors felt
raising me, even as they judged me.

00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:56.609
I want to understand
Min-ji's selfless friendship.

00:12:57.985 --> 00:13:01.155
I want to know the depth of the words
you wrote all over your lamp.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.368
Allow me to have humanity.

00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:09.622
For a day.

00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:11.832
For just one day,

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:17.463
give me what they call feelings
in their normal, purest form.

00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:22.468
When that day passes,
I'll go back to being a negative one.

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:25.387
Someone who is condemned by all.

00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:27.890
A bothersome stone.

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:30.351
That's how I'll die.

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:34.814
This…

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:39.109
is my final wish.

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:50.037
You…

00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:54.708
So you believe I'm capable of killing you.

00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:56.710
So this…

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.464
This is the method of death you've chosen.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.759
I know. That included.

00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:05.928
I am very…

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.014
very selfish.

00:14:12.142 --> 00:14:14.103
So I hope you complete your revenge…

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.065
and gain freedom.

00:14:23.487 --> 00:14:26.198
To the very end,
you make wishes for others' benefit.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.254
At long last, I finally see.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.048
You were right.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.887
Your noble creation.

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:51.807
I bow my head before this pure human.

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:30.262
I will no longer be in your memories.

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:35.559
You, the one I love.

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:40.940
The only human I've ever respected.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.905
My master.

00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:57.873
Farewell.

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:17.893
It has been fulfilled.

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:47.631
This is "gi-yeok."

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:49.508
"Ni-eun."

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.557
Thanks! And congratulations.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.850
- Congratulations.
- Oh boy.

00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:05.024
I still love you either way.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:12.990
Oh boy, my dear Ka-young is warm.

00:17:13.657 --> 00:17:16.410
My dear crybaby is so warm.

00:17:16.493 --> 00:17:18.871
My stubborn darling is warm.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.919
Grandma.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.803
I'm going to kill you!

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.930
I'll kill you, Grandma!

00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:44.855
Grandma!

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:52.571
Grandma hopes that my darling Ka-young,

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.282
that you, my dear bundle of joy,

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:57.659
will cry your heart out with longing.

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.161
Try to hold it in for a minute.

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:01.288
That you will burst out laughing with joy.

00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:03.749
That's what I want for you.

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:10.756
I grew up in Grandma's love.

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:20.974
I thrived as she withered away.

00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:27.356
No, this can't be.

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:32.861
I was not Grandma's strength.

00:18:33.987 --> 00:18:36.782
So that was Grandma's truth.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.161
I was Grandma's burden.

00:18:43.872 --> 00:18:45.582
This is hope.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:47.709
The face of hope.

00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:56.677
Grandma.

00:18:58.053 --> 00:19:01.306
Grandma! Oh no!

00:19:03.058 --> 00:19:07.229
I'm so sorry, Grandma!

00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:11.900
Please, no…

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:15.070
Grandma!

00:19:31.753 --> 00:19:33.589
How? Why is it you're…

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:34.756
How come you lost?

00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:38.385
Ki Ka-young said
she'd make a selfish wish,

00:19:38.468 --> 00:19:40.137
so you should have taken revenge.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.139
That was the bet you two made.

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.142
Ki Ka-young's lifespan was until tomorrow.

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:47.686
What did you say?

00:19:49.479 --> 00:19:50.606
Shaytan!

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:53.859
Keep your promise to him.

00:19:56.236 --> 00:19:58.822
"The day that Iblis bows his head
before a human,

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.866
you, Ejllael, shall slit his throat."

00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:04.328
Please ask him for grace just this once.

00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:07.581
Tell him that she has done nothing wrong.

00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:10.167
Please, I beg of you, Brother.

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:13.128
Everything is as he intended.

00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:17.716
I shall now execute the order
I've waited 1,000 years for.

00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:01.885
I am one who has seen all of your lives.

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:05.222
I will now return to white smoke.

00:21:05.722 --> 00:21:07.599
This is my apology…

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:11.270
as well as another of my sins.

00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:14.982
You have forgotten
something very precious.

00:21:15.482 --> 00:21:16.692
I intend to return

00:21:17.901 --> 00:21:19.069
those memories to you.

00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:10.203
I will remember you, no matter what.

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:14.916
My love.

00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:45.614
Iblis.

00:22:48.825 --> 00:22:50.577
I had forgotten you.

00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:54.873
You could not…

00:22:57.417 --> 00:22:59.336
bring yourself to kill me.

00:23:02.964 --> 00:23:04.841
Because you love me.

00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:09.179
You…

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:12.599
Because of me, you…

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:20.273
Your throat must have been slit.

00:23:26.696 --> 00:23:29.491
I hoped you would be free.

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:32.285
I hoped for you to live.

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:35.414
That's why I did what I did.

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:39.251
How can this be?

00:23:48.552 --> 00:23:52.180
No, this can't be.

00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:55.267
This can't be!

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:15.055
This is the Korean Consulate General
in Dubai.

00:25:15.138 --> 00:25:18.225
We regret to inform you
of the death of Ms. Ki Ka-young.

00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:38.370
So a psychopath

00:25:39.996 --> 00:25:41.373
died while crying?

00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:44.543
Some say that extreme sorrow

00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:46.962
can be fatal.

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:48.755
Even so, a psychopath

00:25:49.422 --> 00:25:51.341
could have just gone on living.

00:25:53.718 --> 00:25:54.803
Goodness.

00:25:55.762 --> 00:25:56.972
My thoughts exactly.

00:25:57.556 --> 00:26:01.059
Let's get all the funeral arrangements
in place before Dr. Choi gets back.

00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:04.062
We're wearing
our funeral clothes too often.

00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:16.283
The body is ready to be returned.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:21.329
These are the only personal items
we were able to retrieve.

00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:37.304
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2024

00:26:37.387 --> 00:26:39.055
KI KA-YOUNG
CREMATION UNDERWAY

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:52.861
Thursday, October 31.

00:26:55.196 --> 00:26:58.450
We will now proceed
to send her off in peace.

00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:07.667
Fire!

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:12.088
It's hot, so hurry out!

00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:15.759
Fire!

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:17.636
It's a fire!

00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:20.930
Fire!

00:27:21.431 --> 00:27:23.725
Get out of there, Ka-young!

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:25.769
I'm sorry, Ka-young!

00:27:27.354 --> 00:27:29.314
It's too hot in there, so please…

00:27:30.357 --> 00:27:34.486
I am a spirit created by smokeless fire,

00:27:34.569 --> 00:27:35.612
a genie.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:42.577
We were created on Thursday,
the day after the angels were made.

00:27:52.253 --> 00:27:54.964
GOBLIN STATIONERY

00:27:57.217 --> 00:27:59.260
CLOSED TEMPORARILY
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:05.558
CHEONGPUNG HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:27.497
THE LATE KI KA-YOUNG

00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:46.141
Tell me your wishes.

00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:49.352
O master of mine.

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:53.314
Ka-young!

00:29:02.699 --> 00:29:03.867
So you're saying

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.370
that after a 1,000-year love,
you also become a jinniya?

00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:11.207
Then where did that person…

00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:15.378
I mean, where did that genie go?

00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:18.089
To eternal solitude.

00:29:20.383 --> 00:29:23.344
Didn't you bring those for me?

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:25.722
I have to give you something
in exchange for wishes?

00:29:27.056 --> 00:29:30.769
Right. You gave Lee Beul-li
a thousand big ones, right?

00:29:31.394 --> 00:29:33.730
Just a moment.
Are you going to make your wish now?

00:29:33.813 --> 00:29:35.190
Can't I?

00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:39.277
No. Those are the rules, so fine.

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:47.952
No bringing back the dead.

00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:50.288
No traveling to the future.

00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:53.625
Anything besides that,

00:29:54.209 --> 00:29:55.627
your wish

00:29:56.419 --> 00:29:59.297
is my command.

00:30:00.673 --> 00:30:02.133
Your speech sucks.

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:05.970
Fine.

00:30:06.054 --> 00:30:09.390
For starters, as my first wish,
eat seafood stew with me every Wednesday.

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:16.815
It's been fulfilled.

00:30:16.898 --> 00:30:18.191
As my second wish,

00:30:18.274 --> 00:30:21.194
send any neighborhood children in need
to my dental clinic.

00:30:21.736 --> 00:30:23.738
They don't go to the dentist
because of the cost.

00:30:24.364 --> 00:30:25.865
And my final wish is…

00:30:25.949 --> 00:30:26.950
Right now? You can't!

00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:29.619
Why would you use them all at once?

00:30:30.245 --> 00:30:32.789
Of course I won't. I'll save it.

00:30:32.872 --> 00:30:33.832
Phew.

00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:36.167
Just these two to start.
They're my wishes.

00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:40.296
They will be fulfilled, Choi Min-ji.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.048
Call me "Master."

00:30:43.716 --> 00:30:45.802
KING ARCADE

00:30:49.764 --> 00:30:50.890
SMILE DENTAL CLINIC

00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:52.892
ODD TEETH AND ODD PEOPLE WELCOME

00:30:58.189 --> 00:31:00.066
Isn't this an arcade?

00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:01.734
Yes, it is an arcade.

00:31:01.818 --> 00:31:04.654
Shall we go have fun
fighting off cavity bacteria together?

00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:08.241
By the way, I heard your grades are awful.

00:31:08.324 --> 00:31:09.367
Excuse me?

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.786
Solve all of these problems
while you wait.

00:31:14.163 --> 00:31:16.875
If you don't,
I'll treat you without anesthesia.

00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:22.630
I'm guessing you're hearing
what I'm saying now in Korean.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.136
That's because I'm a jinniya
who can't speak any foreign languages.

00:31:28.636 --> 00:31:33.600
From now on, you will have to tune in
to K-pop and binge-watch K-dramas.

00:31:40.189 --> 00:31:43.693
Because there's a new jinniya in town,
and she doesn't speak Arabic.

00:31:45.528 --> 00:31:49.407
This year, we're back at
the Cheongpungho Cherry Blossom Festival!

00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:52.160
Our village's pride and joy,
Puffed Five Grains.

00:31:53.828 --> 00:31:55.747
- Now to the next booth.
- Okay.

00:31:56.873 --> 00:31:58.958
Here, we have For Daughter Strawberry!

00:31:59.042 --> 00:32:00.209
Strawberry!

00:32:07.133 --> 00:32:09.218
Hello, we are from Cheongpungho Bank.

00:32:09.302 --> 00:32:11.179
Please drop by for a consultation.

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:16.100
Ki Ka-young.

00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:17.560
You're here.

00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:22.106
Every time I see you like this,
my heart drops.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:23.691
Folks really won't recognize you?

00:32:25.693 --> 00:32:27.820
They all see me with a different face,

00:32:28.655 --> 00:32:30.281
which is quite unfortunate.

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:33.576
I'm so pretty.

00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:38.957
And yet,
I still believe in science after all this.

00:32:42.335 --> 00:32:43.378
Come take a look.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.055
If you thought you'd be safe this year,
you thought wrong.

00:33:04.691 --> 00:33:06.985
AS SEXY
FUCK YOU

00:33:13.366 --> 00:33:16.202
KI KA-YOUNG
YOU'RE IN MY HEART

00:33:16.285 --> 00:33:17.787
I dropped some cash.

00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:45.273
I've always imagined
what I would do if you died,

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:47.734
but I was completely unprepared

00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:50.862
for what to do if you cried.

00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:53.531
So I thought about it for a few days.

00:33:54.907 --> 00:33:55.867
And?

00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:58.494
And

00:33:58.995 --> 00:34:01.748
whether you're a jinniya or a spirit,

00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:06.586
I just want you to always be happy
in this newfound life of yours.

00:34:10.923 --> 00:34:14.469
Don't cry and don't die.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.098
Reunite with the one you miss most.

00:34:22.977 --> 00:34:24.812
This is my third wish.

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:27.690
No, Choi Min-ji, you can't.
You'll end up forgetting me!

00:34:33.529 --> 00:34:34.864
My body isn't glowing.

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:36.407
What is this?

00:34:37.492 --> 00:34:40.119
Does that mean this wish
has already been fulfilled?

00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:43.581
That's right. I met you again.

00:34:44.457 --> 00:34:45.416
That scared me.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.376
The truth is

00:34:48.211 --> 00:34:49.629
once you make your final wish…

00:34:49.712 --> 00:34:50.963
I'll be back soon.

00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:52.673
Take care.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.926
Goodbye, Ki Ka-young.

00:35:06.854 --> 00:35:08.022
I'm sorry.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:53.711
Grandma?

00:36:59.425 --> 00:37:00.843
Have you come to see me?

00:37:06.641 --> 00:37:07.558
Grandma!

00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.570
Come back to see me again.

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.323
Come next spring too!

00:37:23.991 --> 00:37:25.451
Be sure to come every spring!

00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:38.923
{\an8}This painting belonged to my ancestors
six generations ago.

00:37:39.006 --> 00:37:40.591
{\an8}The style is quite unique.

00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:44.637
{\an8}I want to authenticate it to determine
if it's a genuine Joseon dynasty artifact.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.764
{\an8}We call paintings like these miindo.

00:37:46.847 --> 00:37:50.393
{\an8}These portraits of beautiful women
typically have an East Asian flair,

00:37:50.476 --> 00:37:54.063
whereas this one looks like
an Egyptian painting.

00:37:55.147 --> 00:37:59.402
So many things have happened,
but I'm still assistant branch manager.

00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:03.322
I want to be poached by a rival company.

00:38:03.906 --> 00:38:05.408
This is my final wish.

00:38:05.491 --> 00:38:08.369
Tell me one crucial trade secret
of this supermarket.

00:38:09.495 --> 00:38:10.579
That's easy.

00:38:19.255 --> 00:38:20.381
It has been fulfilled.

00:38:22.508 --> 00:38:25.011
I shall tell you a crucial trade secret.

00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:34.729
They recommend displaying
Jin instant noodles at the front.

00:38:50.578 --> 00:38:52.913
Things must have been
really lonely for you.

00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:56.042
Everyone would forget you.

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:59.545
And you alone would remember.

00:39:02.298 --> 00:39:03.257
It's raining

00:39:03.758 --> 00:39:05.426
flower petals.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.221
This

00:39:09.805 --> 00:39:11.349
is the perfect moment.

00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:21.585
It's been a while, lump of clay.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:25.214
I've missed you.

00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:28.342
How did you come back?

00:40:29.051 --> 00:40:30.344
Min-ji's wish

00:40:31.345 --> 00:40:32.930
glowed with the flower petals.

00:40:34.014 --> 00:40:37.184
I don't know how I came back either.

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:41.647
Come on, just move on already!

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:44.733
Why are you messing with the system
in a foreign land?

00:40:44.817 --> 00:40:48.946
You little brat!
How dare you raise your voice!

00:40:49.655 --> 00:40:53.784
I now have nothing to fear,
even if you were to tell me I'd die again.

00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:56.287
And I'm not scared of hell either.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:58.247
I don't need anything else.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:02.751
All you need to do is take me
to meet that boss of yours.

00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:06.464
You crazy human! Do you think
he is someone you can just meet at will?

00:41:07.089 --> 00:41:08.048
Come on.

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:11.844
You're guaranteed a spot in heaven.
Why refuse heaven to stay here doing this?

00:41:11.927 --> 00:41:13.429
Heaven?

00:41:14.763 --> 00:41:15.973
I don't need heaven.

00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:19.810
My Ka-young died and became Satan,
so what use is heaven now?

00:41:19.894 --> 00:41:20.853
And you…

00:41:21.395 --> 00:41:24.315
you told me the day I'd die,
so didn't you reveal divine secrets?

00:41:24.899 --> 00:41:28.444
And you told me in a roundabout way,
so I almost didn't catch on.

00:41:29.028 --> 00:41:30.738
Lucky I'm as sharp as a tack.

00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:34.366
So this is something
you absolutely must do for me.

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:35.743
You said you were an angel.

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:39.330
After all the havoc you've wreaked,
you should at least do me a favor.

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.461
What the hell is it that you want?

00:41:47.421 --> 00:41:49.632
Yes, I know that it's been loud.

00:41:51.133 --> 00:41:53.052
Pardon? But I…

00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:55.930
Despite that…

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:58.140
Even so!

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:02.144
Yes, I understand.

00:42:04.438 --> 00:42:05.272
So,

00:42:06.315 --> 00:42:08.859
toward Goryeo, with all my might?

00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:26.335
Once again, you don't know the full story?

00:42:27.336 --> 00:42:28.921
Come on, we've just reunited.

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:30.714
Whatever.

00:42:30.798 --> 00:42:33.676
Now I'll be claiming the title
of the world's most famous genie.

00:42:33.759 --> 00:42:35.719
What kind of conclusion is that? No way!

00:42:36.971 --> 00:42:38.472
I'd rather die than give that up.

00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:40.266
Why not? Let me have it!

00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:43.978
I can even do this.

00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:03.205
You haven't changed a bit.

00:43:06.458 --> 00:43:07.751
Just as alarming

00:43:09.378 --> 00:43:10.462
as it is charming.

00:43:23.809 --> 00:43:27.646
Just hurry up already!
We need to get seats at the front.

00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:30.941
Why are we here at the crack of dawn?

00:43:31.025 --> 00:43:33.861
Harvesting cabbage is great.
The pay's good, and they feed you.

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:37.573
These jobs are hard to come by
in the current job market.

00:43:37.656 --> 00:43:41.118
Look, there are already three people.
Hey, Mr. Kim. You're here.

00:43:42.244 --> 00:43:45.080
Hurry and take a seat.
I hope they need at least four people.

00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:46.749
- Have you eaten?
- Of course.

00:43:47.249 --> 00:43:49.418
Oh dear, a young man like you.

00:43:49.501 --> 00:43:52.588
You must be having a very hard time,
mumbling to yourself like that.

00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:56.675
Only I can see you right now?

00:43:57.885 --> 00:44:00.179
That is really difficult to do.

00:44:00.262 --> 00:44:03.557
It took me 11,000 years
to master that skill.

00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:06.226
Takes around 110 centuries
to learn things.

00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:08.812
Damn it.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.689
This won't do.

00:44:10.773 --> 00:44:13.150
You should wear something too.
Pray they pick us.

00:44:13.233 --> 00:44:14.151
Why should I?

00:44:14.234 --> 00:44:18.072
We need to buy you something to wear,
but you're a jinniya now, so you're broke.

00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:20.949
Broke? I have money.

00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:24.286
What? How would you have money?

00:44:30.959 --> 00:44:32.211
See that?

00:44:35.631 --> 00:44:36.465
Wow!

00:44:39.885 --> 00:44:42.554
- Can I have just 10,000 won?
- 10,000 won?

00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:46.266
So now you're adjusting for inflation?

00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:49.978
Don't think about doing anything silly,
and go and get a haircut.

00:44:50.062 --> 00:44:51.855
You could pass as Moon Dong-eun.

00:44:52.606 --> 00:44:53.732
I have my reasons.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.318
I'm going to try to make Sade again.

00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:59.154
This time I'm using luxury hair masks

00:44:59.655 --> 00:45:02.950
and taking extra care,
so he may be born in a different form.

00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:04.827
Right, Sade told me.

00:45:05.327 --> 00:45:07.329
Fine, I understand the hair.

00:45:08.122 --> 00:45:10.040
But why did you add a teardrop?

00:45:10.124 --> 00:45:14.128
The first Sade actually died
protecting me in the 300-year war.

00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:18.799
So after the war ended, I added
a drop of my sadness and remade him.

00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:21.218
That's who you saw, the second iteration.

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:24.221
I should have known. He was quite misty.

00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:28.350
So that's why I intend to keep things dry
this time around.

00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:33.063
Hey, I have a wish-maker.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:54.668
Oh my, you scared me!

00:45:56.211 --> 00:45:57.463
Who are you?

00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:00.340
What's with the hair?

00:46:01.133 --> 00:46:03.969
There is a reason for my hair.
Sorry for scaring you.

00:46:04.052 --> 00:46:05.471
I'm here to share good news.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:10.392
I am Genie, the lamp spirit.
I shall grant you three wishes.

00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:14.188
Right, so you're a fucking genie? Okay.

00:46:14.813 --> 00:46:17.191
Is this a new scam?
How much of this was a setup?

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.986
This is a common response.
That's why I've prepared a manual.

00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:24.114
The first page has possible wishes.
The last, impossible ones.

00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:28.619
WISH-MAKER'S MANUAL

00:46:28.702 --> 00:46:30.662
Be meticulous with any special terms.

00:46:30.746 --> 00:46:33.540
Immortality? You'd regret it.
Just watch three vampire movies.

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:34.875
Changing the past?

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:37.169
Butterfly effects happen,
so if you're not smart…

00:46:38.837 --> 00:46:39.797
Just give up on it.

00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:43.759
If you happen to have the means,
could you buy me a beverage?

00:46:49.014 --> 00:46:50.474
- Aren't you a genie?
- Yes.

00:46:50.557 --> 00:46:52.226
You said you'd grant my wishes.

00:46:52.768 --> 00:46:54.978
Then why the fuck
are you asking me for wishes?

00:46:57.981 --> 00:47:01.318
Didn't you once have a lot of faith in him

00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:03.821
and, you know, have a very pure soul?

00:47:04.404 --> 00:47:06.573
Wait, do you also believe
in ancestral deities?

00:47:09.409 --> 00:47:11.203
This will bring out my soft side.

00:47:12.746 --> 00:47:15.374
There's a higher power in this realm too.
They're called diamonds.

00:47:15.457 --> 00:47:16.834
Practically deities.

00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:19.795
"Germanium jade mats"?
Right, what is this?

00:47:19.878 --> 00:47:23.382
To put it simply, it's a magic carpet
that generates heat by itself.

00:47:24.132 --> 00:47:25.342
Like a genie's magic ride.

00:47:26.802 --> 00:47:28.554
You'd start with ten mats.

00:47:28.637 --> 00:47:31.390
Once you sell ten,
the next one's free of charge.

00:47:31.473 --> 00:47:34.226
Free? This carpet here is free?

00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:38.647
Yes. That's why there's no need
for an upfront payment.

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:41.275
This really is
a rare opportunity, you know.

00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:43.902
- There's no upfront payment?
- Yes.

00:47:44.486 --> 00:47:47.197
Then maybe I shouldn't be going
to the cabbage patches.

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:50.492
Wait, but if I work
the cabbage patches and do this…

00:47:53.161 --> 00:47:55.163
Mr. Kim, Mr. Park, Mr. Choi.

00:47:55.247 --> 00:47:56.832
Sang-hyeok, when he grows up.

00:47:56.915 --> 00:47:57.833
Ejllael

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.043
wouldn't buy one from me.

00:48:00.127 --> 00:48:01.587
Hey, could you sign here?

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:05.215
Min-ji! Has forgotten who I am.

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:07.175
Oh Pan-geum!

00:48:07.676 --> 00:48:09.428
Has, oh…

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:11.388
She's not around.

00:48:11.972 --> 00:48:14.766
This is such a great product,
but I can't sell it.

00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:17.519
I just can't think of ten people.

00:48:17.603 --> 00:48:19.271
Irem isn't here, nor is Sade.

00:48:20.355 --> 00:48:21.690
I miss Oh Pan-geum.

00:48:24.693 --> 00:48:25.819
Are you well?

00:48:27.112 --> 00:48:29.031
You're keeping an eye on us, right?

00:48:30.157 --> 00:48:31.366
I'm doing well.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:34.036
I see you're lacking in many areas.

00:48:35.704 --> 00:48:37.539
Let's just forget this altogether.

00:48:40.375 --> 00:48:41.501
Where are you going?

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:44.046
Make a wish before you go!
I actually am a genie!

00:48:44.838 --> 00:48:45.672
Make your wish.

00:48:46.298 --> 00:48:49.509
No bringing back the dead.
No traveling to the future.

00:48:50.052 --> 00:48:51.845
Anything besides that,

00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:53.430
your wish

00:48:54.681 --> 00:48:56.016
is my command.

00:48:57.893 --> 00:49:00.938
That way leads to a road!
Why do you always go that way?

00:49:13.367 --> 00:49:14.201
Hey.

00:49:15.661 --> 00:49:18.246
Did you use an entire bottle
of my favorite shampoo?

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:21.792
Well, I only did that
so I could make Sade.

00:49:23.835 --> 00:49:25.379
I'm going to kill you!

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.925
- Come here.
- You come.

00:49:30.008 --> 00:49:30.926
Get over here!

00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:33.345
- Come here.
- I don't want to.

00:49:33.428 --> 00:49:34.262
I said come here.

00:49:34.346 --> 00:49:35.681
I said I don't want to.

00:49:35.764 --> 00:49:37.391
Don't talk back to me!

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:38.850
Don't ask me questions!

00:49:39.977 --> 00:49:41.979
Come here. I said get over here.

00:49:42.062 --> 00:49:42.938
No.

00:49:43.021 --> 00:49:43.855
No way!

00:49:44.356 --> 00:49:45.607
That little guy's back.

00:49:47.609 --> 00:49:50.112
No way. He's back too.

00:49:53.073 --> 00:49:56.493
You used an entire bottle of shampoo,
and he looks exactly the same?

00:49:56.994 --> 00:50:00.163
I felt bad because I thought
it was the state of my hair.

00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:02.624
But I feel less guilty now.

00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:04.835
Master.

00:50:05.544 --> 00:50:06.461
Boss.

00:50:12.467 --> 00:50:14.469
I missed you guys.

00:50:20.142 --> 00:50:20.976
Come on!

00:50:21.059 --> 00:50:24.604
Seriously, just let go of me!

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:28.650
Hey, do you want to be obliterated again?
I'm busy enough trying to grow new wings.

00:50:28.734 --> 00:50:31.319
Ejllael, you're evil!

00:50:31.403 --> 00:50:33.780
Create Irem again!

00:50:34.906 --> 00:50:37.242
Oh, come on. Please!

00:50:37.743 --> 00:50:39.619
Seriously!

00:50:53.633 --> 00:50:54.760
Been a while, Brother.

00:50:57.387 --> 00:50:58.889
I see your neck's reattached.

00:50:58.972 --> 00:51:00.974
Yeah, thanks for the congratulations.

00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:02.893
And thanks for delivering my lamp too.

00:51:02.976 --> 00:51:04.728
But why are you still on Goryeo land?

00:51:04.811 --> 00:51:06.688
I've invested in several buildings here.

00:51:06.772 --> 00:51:08.690
Land is a long-term investment.

00:51:09.191 --> 00:51:12.778
And did you know? Ki Ka-young
hasn't bowed before a human either.

00:51:12.861 --> 00:51:15.864
Nonsense. Ki Ka-young bows
at Oh Pan-geum's grave every day.

00:51:15.947 --> 00:51:17.824
Dead humans don't count!

00:51:19.618 --> 00:51:22.037
Just thinking about those threats
from Oh Pan-geum…

00:51:22.537 --> 00:51:23.371
Threats?

00:51:23.955 --> 00:51:26.958
I am so sick of humans.
They're always beyond imagination.

00:51:27.042 --> 00:51:31.338
She refused heaven and reincarnation.
She just yelled at him to revive you!

00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:33.715
Do you understand the bind I was in?

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.224
So I came back thanks to Oh Pan-geum.

00:51:42.307 --> 00:51:43.141
Anyway,

00:51:43.725 --> 00:51:46.478
Oh Pan-geum asked me to relay this
to you and Ki Ka-young.

00:51:47.521 --> 00:51:48.438
Relay what?

00:51:51.233 --> 00:51:52.734
Sade!

00:51:52.818 --> 00:51:54.111
Jinniya!

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:55.946
Iblis!

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:58.782
Mr. Village Chief!

00:51:58.865 --> 00:52:01.618
GERMANIUM JADE MAT

00:52:09.334 --> 00:52:10.460
What is that?

00:52:12.546 --> 00:52:13.380
This?

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:17.801
Well, I bought these a long time ago.

00:52:17.884 --> 00:52:20.387
It's a magic carpet
that generates heat on its own.

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:23.348
If I sell ten, I get another one for free.

00:52:23.431 --> 00:52:26.434
Right, I also give you one free smack
after you get ten.

00:52:26.518 --> 00:52:28.645
- Get over here.
- Just hear me out!

00:52:28.728 --> 00:52:31.356
Now that Sade and Irem are back,
I have nine people.

00:52:31.439 --> 00:52:33.150
I just need one more person. Hey!

00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:34.359
Time for a coffee break.

00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:38.613
By the way, Mr. Kim from the cabbage patch
passed away yesterday.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.283
What?

00:52:41.366 --> 00:52:43.451
Where did you get these?

00:52:43.535 --> 00:52:45.370
Did you join a pyramid scheme too?

00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:49.249
- Hey, where did you…
- They look vintage, don't they?

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:51.668
I found them
shoved in the corner of the lamp.

00:52:56.756 --> 00:52:58.758
But I can smell Jinniya's scent on these.

00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:00.552
Sade, you bastard!

00:53:02.637 --> 00:53:05.640
It was an early wedding gift.
A wedding gift for you and me.

00:53:05.724 --> 00:53:07.517
You said you couldn't go to the future.

00:53:08.476 --> 00:53:10.687
So you didn't see the bloody future
ahead of you?

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:12.731
Come here. Yes, come here.

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:15.859
Get over here!

00:53:16.484 --> 00:53:17.944
That's hot, damn.

00:53:31.499 --> 00:53:33.418
The sword is back?

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.928
Do you see that sand whirl over there?

00:53:43.011 --> 00:53:46.765
In Arabic culture, that phenomenon
is called the "waltzing genie."

00:53:46.848 --> 00:53:48.266
Wow, a genie?

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.645
The spirit of the lamp we've all heard of?
How awesome!

00:53:52.604 --> 00:53:54.648
Wow, that's so impressive!

00:53:56.316 --> 00:53:58.401
Dr. Choi, you're back.

00:53:59.778 --> 00:54:00.695
Yes.

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.157
I just can't get enough of this place.

00:54:33.144 --> 00:54:35.689
We've been dancing the waltz for decades,

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:37.607
yet you still step on my toes?

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:41.278
I did it on purpose
so we don't forget where we started.

00:54:42.404 --> 00:54:44.322
And I have something to tell you.

00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:46.449
- Ha--
- Don't!

00:54:48.493 --> 00:54:49.703
The timing is, you know?

00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:56.251
Everyone is on the edge of their seats,
thinking we might end with "habibti."

00:55:00.755 --> 00:55:03.800
I thought I could sense
some fierce gazes upon us.

00:55:05.302 --> 00:55:08.179
But I was actually
going to say "halmeoni."

00:55:11.266 --> 00:55:12.309
That's a relief.

00:55:13.685 --> 00:55:15.729
Halmeoni? You mean my grandma?

00:55:16.271 --> 00:55:20.066
Yes. It was thanks
to Oh Pan-geum that I came back.

00:55:21.067 --> 00:55:21.985
And

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:25.322
she wanted to pass on that message.

00:55:28.742 --> 00:55:32.620
I SHALL NOW LEAVE YOU EACH
WITH ONE SATAN AND ONE PSYCHOPATH

00:55:32.704 --> 00:55:35.290
MAY YOU BOTH LOVE AND LONG FOR EACH OTHER

00:55:47.302 --> 00:55:48.511
It's a wish-maker.

00:55:49.554 --> 00:55:51.514
Give it your best, psychopath.

00:55:52.932 --> 00:55:54.267
Don't worry about me.

00:55:54.768 --> 00:55:56.644
See you later, Satan.

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:44.080

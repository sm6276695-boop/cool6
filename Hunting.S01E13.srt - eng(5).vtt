00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.850
Officer Luo,

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.560
time's almost up.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.140
Can I leave now?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.070
We still have a few minutes.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.270
Let's chat a bit more.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.690
I'll talk when my lawyer gets here, okay?

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.330
No wonder you're from Xinji,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.890
refusing to talk without a lawyer.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.790
It's fine.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.190
I'll talk and you just need to listen.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.400
Mr. Tang, that employee of yours,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.080
Mr. Peng Jiangyu,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.960
was shot and killed by us at such a young age.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.910
What a shame.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.870
So I hope when you go back,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.480
you can keep your subordinates in line

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.790
and stop them from opposing the police.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.980
No need to teach me
how to handle my business.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.920
Right,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.090
it's your internal affair.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.200
But I'm really puzzled.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.710
We actually received a tip,

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.680
which is why we searched that ship.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.800
And then,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.290
we thought it was crystal meth.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.100
Who knew it was actually rock sugar?

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.840
It's rock sugar.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.010
Smuggling rock sugar
isn't such a serious crime.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.710
Was there any need to
violently resist law enforcement

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.110
and end up
being shot and killed on the spot?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.330
Didn't they know it was rock sugar?

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.710
I see.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.770
Check it yourself.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.930
I know you don't believe me.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.720
Time's up.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.860
Can I leave now?

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.350
Of course, you can leave now.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.000
Go ahead.

[Police]

All existing evidence

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.550
cannot pinpoint Tang Du as the culprit.

[Police]

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.310
He's an old fox.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.079
Of course there's no evidence.

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.030
He didn't even come here to make a deal.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.079
He's really an old hand!

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.310
But he still couldn't hold back
in the end, right?

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.080
Do you think

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.560
Xin Sheng He will

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.310
have internal conflicts soon?

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.310
Definitely.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.240
Drug dealers are all about money.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.500
Now that they can't make money,
they'll definitely fight.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.030
You're so clever.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.750
Have you checked the goods?

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.680
Yes, I have.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.680
You have checked?

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.500
We might have been tricked by the police.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.510
Hello.

Okay.

Ouch, my leg.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.270
My leg hurts so bad!

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:08.920
Help me up, please.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.000

Why didn't you wait for me?

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.870
Why don't you ever listen to me?

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.650

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.250
Even at a time like this,
you're still thinking about money.

she'd like you to have this

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.650
You've grown up now,
so you can have it.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.560
Get it?

Don't lose it.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.240
It's very valuable.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.000
Did the police come to find you?

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.060
Yes, of course.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.710
The police went to my father.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.100
He didn't sell you out, did he?

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.430
How could he?

He's my father.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.100
He just told me

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.290
not to handle company business anymore.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.180

it would turn out like this.

I accidentally killed Gold-Tooth Wan.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.730
I burned the meth in the car.

But he has nothing to do
with these things.

why you stole Xin Chuanyong's car.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.520
He refused to return my deposit.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.240

On impulse?

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.830
There were 200 kilos of drugs in that car.

Then why did you destroy them?

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.500
Keeping those things would harm people.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:04.640
Right.

You have a strong sense of justice.

Okay.

Ma Duozai's confession

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.380
is basically consistent with
what we know.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.840
He probably wasn't lying.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:41.820
He wasn't lying,

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.440
but he was definitely hiding something.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.110
Indeed.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.030
Wan Shan's death shows

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.960
he was deliberately
taking the blame for Mou Jiahao.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.240
I don't know if he's being loyal
or just stupid.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.640
Duozai thought
he accidentally killed Wan Shan,

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.790
so he ran away.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.240
So can you confirm he's

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.490
that “Assassin” you met in the game?

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.070
Yes.

What do you think of him?

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.970
I think he's quite sincere.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.030
You can tell from the interrogation.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.480
And he voluntarily destroyed the drugs.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:12.960
This proves

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.750
he couldn't possibly be
working with drug dealers.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:15.950
What does that prove?

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.480
He might have destroyed the drugs

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.010
just to escape punishment.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.000
As police officers,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
we need evidence.

Have you found Mou Jiahao?

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.750
He wasn't at the internet cafe.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.950
He probably ran away.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.070
Check the surveillance cameras
around the internet cafe again.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.550

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.440
What should we do with Ma Duozai?

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.570
Without more evidence for now,

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.780
send him to the detention center.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.420
By the way, how's the investigation
on that temple fair going?

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:46.270
Wait a sec.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.400
Wan Shan's actual cause of death

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.480
was a stroke triggered

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.480
by intense physical activity
after drug use.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.720
Taking Xin Chuanyong's car
was a debt dispute.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.070
Duozai shouldn't be in
too much trouble, right?

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.270
If you were the judge,

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.270
would you just release him in court?

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.120
He still needs to be detained.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.160
The information left by the suspect
was all fake.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:16.920
Li Fumin said

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.340
it was due to poor internal management

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.480
that someone took advantage of.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.750
He promised to strengthen
security measures in the future.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.300
What about the surveillance footage?

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.920
Nothing significant was found.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.920
This yacht club

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.200
was established by Li Shipping Company
not long ago.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.480
This company has
no legal record or violations.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.800
I suspect

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.750
someone inside the company has been bribed

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.080
to work with Luo Yuansu.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.400
Okay, I see.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.880
Keep following up on this.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:45.840
An, let me tell you,

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.110
please be mindful of what you say and do.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.970
Go back to work.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.050
Got it.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:58.120
[Police]

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:05.620
Are you the "Assassin"?

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.270
No.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.380
Who is it?

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.300
What made you here?

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.070
I'm feeling down.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.420
Is there any way I can let off some steam?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.130
You can go clubbing.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:41.970
Go clubbing?

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.380
Is this clubbing?

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.320
Is there any difference?

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.240
The difference is huge.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:02.000
It's so free.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.290
Aren't you going to sleep?

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.730
You know what?

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.020
In here,

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.340
I am the boss.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:31.660
Do you yield?

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:33.590
Do you?

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:37.960
Do you admit defeat?

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.660
Let's see if you do.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.430
-Let go.
-Squat down.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.550
Squat down.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.440
Let go.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.550
Sit down!

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.200
Come down. Squat.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.990
Squat down.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.020
Squat down.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.610
You feel sorry for him.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.970
I know we, as police officers,
need to stay rational at all times.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.420
But I have to admit,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.480
when I see him like this,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.390
I can't help but feel his pain.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:37.600
When we arrested him,

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.070
his father was lying there,

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.940
just passed away.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.200
It reminded me of when my father died.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.760
I suddenly understood how he felt.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.700
That feeling of complete helplessness.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.620
Duozai is an unfortunate kid.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.500
He has experienced more than others.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.680
Life is tough for him.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.660
We are friends.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.650
I don't want him to think
that I'm lying to him.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:08.980
You're not lying to him.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.750
You're helping him.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.670
If he keeps running away,

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.650
he'll do more terrible things.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.680
I think I'll never forget

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.930
the way he looked at me then
for the rest of my life.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.270
You like him?

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:29.550
We're just friends.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.270
Be honest.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.360
We really are just friends.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.070
You can worry about him

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.600
and even feel sorry for him,

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.600
but that's it.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.310
You shouldn't invest
any more of your feelings.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:42.510
It's not good for you.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.040
But Duozai isn't a drug dealer.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.800
He destroyed all those drugs.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.790
He's different from those people.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:48.920
How is he different?

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.240
He could have called the police

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.300
and told them.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.640
Why did he have to
destroy all of the drugs?

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.590
Uncle Yang,

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.550
I think your expectations for him
are a bit too high.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.270
It's not that my expectations are high.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:01.200
He simply doesn't trust us police.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.050
He knows very well

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.700
that he and we are like black and white.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.220
We are people
from two different worlds.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.590
Isn't there any chance
we can bring him over

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:10.880
to our side?

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.560
That's not for us to decide.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:14.460
No one can decide these things.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.800
Like I said,

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.630
don't invest more emotions,

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.290
or don't have high expectations for him.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.160
Keep your relationship with him

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.410
to the online world.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.130
Remember that.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.640
Things between us might never go back to
how they were.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.910
We've been tricked by that cook.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.000
We can't just let this go!

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.330
Leave it to me, Grandpa.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.720
Grandpa.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.600
This time,
you didn't hand Mou Lang over to him.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.720
At least you got one thing right.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:03.820
By the way,

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.400
where is Mou Lang?

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.040
Mou Lang...

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.060
He died.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:14.910
When did this happen?

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.900
I disposed his body in the sea
before the deal.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.480
What were you thinking?

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.130
I accidentally went a bit too far.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.710
Accidentally?

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.330
Do you think I'm senile?

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.840
Don't be angry.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:30.630
Keeping that idiot around
was useless anyway.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.020
What did you get out of him?

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.170
Take a guess.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.270
If you hadn't gotten something useful,

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.930
you wouldn't have killed him.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.240
If I tell you,

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.690
will you forgive me?

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:44.380
Stop playing games with me.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.520
Mou Haidong left Mou Lang

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.090
a dark web account

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.290
with an inheritance in it.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:52.170
How much?

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.610
20,000 cryptocurrency units,

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:57.660
worth 300 million yuan.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.490
What about the account?

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.910
I have it.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.610
Take over the account from now on.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.170
Understood, Master Du.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:06.950
Grandpa.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.550
It took a lot of effort

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:10.950
to get this information.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.400
Don't I deserve a reward?

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.480
I raised you,

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:17.360
hoping you'd make something of yourself.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.220
Xin Sheng He
will be yours sooner or later.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.480
But not now.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.040
Merits offset faults.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.990
No reward this time.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:33.840
Fine.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:43.090
Master Du.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:45.200
Has she been

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.270
using drugs again recently?

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.400
I'll look into it.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:32:59.460
Duozai.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:02.450
Regarding drugs,

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:04.310
he's always been firmly against them.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:07.240
It's unlikely
he'd be involved in drug trafficking.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.650
But I think he was hiding something.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.430
The kid values loyalty.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.870
He was probably
manipulated by that drug cook.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.330
How should we deal with him?

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.560
Based on the evidence we have,

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.190
we'll detain him for a while.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.970
Did you check the yacht?

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:29.510
Yes.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:31.750
But his previous records

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:32.790
are pretty clean.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.880
When we investigated them this time,

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.150
they claimed
it was due to poor internal management.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.720
They said
they would rectify the situation.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.200
But Lin Qiong suspects

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.730
someone inside was bribed.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.730
Do we have any suspects?

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.590
Not yet.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.860
Find a way to investigate.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.020
Me?

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.500
What will you do then?

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:51.560
You're a special agent.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.320
It's not convenient for me.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.020
Let me tell you,

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.570
Chief Fang has transferred
your case to me.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.220
So who's in charge of whom?

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.070
Obviously,

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:04.350
I'm the acting captain.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.600
What do you think?

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.659
Childish.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.370
Look at how the rod is bending.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.440
It must be a big fish.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
What are you so excited about?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.800
So childish.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.739
Here it comes!

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.530
The line is tangled.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:32.000
That's really unfortunate.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.550
Fine, you're the expert.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.960
It's really deep.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.710
Be careful.

in the long term.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.560
But this time I came

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:31.930
with only one purpose:

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.610
to take my brother back.

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.440
No problem.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:36.650
Whether the previous batch of goods

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:38.130
was real or fake,

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:40.290
the bottom line is,

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.580
if the goods aren't returned,

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:45.380
you can't leave either.

[Episode 14]

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.870
Alert! Two men in black.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.180
Master Du,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.510
if I don't agree,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.470
I can't leave, right?

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.470
What do you think?

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.150
Fine,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.770
I'll stay.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.020
But I wonder

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.480
whether you know...

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.910
Run!

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.960
Run!

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.790
Quick! Get in the car!

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.120
It's too dangerous.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.280
That guy called Tang

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.079
never intended to hand him over.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.970
He even wanted to silence us.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.400
[Watch your step]

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.329
Give me the gun. I'll kill them all.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.440
I've never been so humiliated.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.430
We can't stay in this place anymore.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.800
Are you listening to me?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.750
We can't stay in Xinji anymore.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.410
Let's get out of here quickly.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.490
We can't leave yet.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.040
Without Mou Lang,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.140
everything we've done would be useless.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.000
They'll send assassins after us.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.980
What do we do now?

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.800
Say something!

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.310
Let's go find Mr. Huang.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.930
I'll wait for you outside.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.170
Are you out of your mind?

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.200
You just handed over

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.180
confidential client information?

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.310
That was my account. You just gave him.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:21.399
I'm sorry.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.330
When he pointed a gun at my head,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.640
I didn't tell him.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.060
But...

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.230
he somehow knew

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.200
my family's address in Australia

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.870
and threatened to kill them.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.870
I'm sorry.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.440
So you've been holding Mou Lang hostage

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.770
just to get my account.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.180
Tang Du brought me to Xinji to kill me.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.040
Tang Du,

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.909
to hell with him!

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.000
I don't think

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.630
this is Tang Du's style.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.770
Tang Du has been in charge

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.260
of Xin Sheng He for years.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.550
He always plays by the rules.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.150
Otherwise,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.040
he wouldn't have let you delay

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.140
for three years.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.800
So who actually threatened you?

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.220
The woman from the Tang family

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.010
is the one you should watch out for.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.400
She never follows any rules.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.120
Tang Jinshan.

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.020
Grandpa,

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.470
I caught a really fresh fish for you.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.760
I'll cook it for you.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.530
You really take good care of me.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.030
I didn't die at the teahouse.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.070
Should I thank you for sparing my life?

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.090
Grandpa,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.800
what are you talking about?

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.900
Bring them in.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.630
Come.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.430
You hired two lackeys

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.690
to sabotage my business at the teahouse.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.680
Miss Tang.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.360
Take them away.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.960
Grandpa,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.960
the account is already ours now.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.640
We should get rid of that cook

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.930
to avoid future trouble.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.810
I thought you felt the same way.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.840
Xin Sheng He doesn't do one-time deals.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.510
Mou Sen is talented.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.150
Even if we can't get the goods,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.610
we should keep him around.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.680
Mou Sen, Mou Sen.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.370
He played you

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.000
and you still want to keep him?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.150
Are you a masochist?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.480
You can’t interfere

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:36.409
in Xin Sheng He’s business any more.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.970
Grandpa,

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.130
you should step down when you're old.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.040
Why don't you retire early?

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.090
Step aside for a drug addict like you?

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.340
Let me tell you,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.370
people in Xin Sheng He

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:55.870
are forbidden to touch drugs.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.130
I never thought you'd turn out like this.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.740
I shouldn't have let you return to Xinji.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.250
Grandpa,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.090
you have to try it

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.630
to know how this business works.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.330
Meth is outdated now.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.530
This is the future!

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.680
With such old-fashioned thinking,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.210
things will only get worse.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.700
Let me tell you,

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.280
I spent half my life

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.670
building Xin Sheng He.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.590
I will never hand it over

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:23.720
to someone like you.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.120
Aren't I your granddaughter?

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.840
The one and only,

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.010
right?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.820
If you don't give Xin Sheng He to me,

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.150
who will you give it to?

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.800
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.430
I'm sorry.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.970
I was wrong, OK? Grandpa.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.750
Enough!

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.090
How did I raise such a lunatic?

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.650
Just like your parents,

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.010
you all disappoint me.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.160
Take Miss Tang to Canada.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.690
Find a rehab center for her.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.330
You’re no longer allowed

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.990
to interfere in the business.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.100
I'm not addicted, Grandpa!

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.360
Take her to the airport

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.480
immediately.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.750
I'm not addicted!

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.890
Grandpa!

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.240
Grandpa!

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.200
Grandpa!

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.840
You're really Grandpa's good dog.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.159
He must like you more than me.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.470
Be careful.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.370
Hong Kun,

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.480
that name

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.270
sounds better.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.560
Everything's ready.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.760
Miss Tang left this for you.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.490
Have a safe journey.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.040
Master Du,

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.230
Miss Tang has been sent away.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.060
Let her reflect on her actions.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:35.930
So,

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.800
how are the funds arranged?

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:38.910
The cryptocurrency has been exchanged

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:39.700
[Balance]

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.010
for three hundred million yuan.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.940
Eighty million has been received.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.670
Good.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.290
Now we can give everyone an explanation.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.960
Also,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.390
the international buyer

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.480
has made an appointment.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.410
After the board meeting,

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.070
he wants to meet you in person.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.270
Whether we return the money or the goods,

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.270
we must give buyers an explanation.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.660
I called everyone here today

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.200
to discuss our previous business deal.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.330
I'd like to hear everyone's opinions.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.340
Since Master Du has asked for our input,

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.040
may I, as a senior member of Xin Sheng He,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.030
speak first?

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:19.930
Of course.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.930
I believe everyone remembers

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.490
that 200 kilos of goods

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.180
from three years ago.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.720
We all invested in it.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.520
We were promised

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.110
a 50% profit.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.070
But,

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:34.870
we provided the manpower

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:35.780
and the money,

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.900
yet we haven't seen the goods,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.400
and the money

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.200
hasn't been earned either.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.260
How do you expect us

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.480
to trust you?

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.770
The business from three years ago

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.800
has indeed dragged on for too long.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.550
However,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.360
I, Tang Du, always keep my promises.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.200
All these years, Xin Sheng He

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.120
has never lost money on any deal.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:56.940
Today, I'm here

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.940
to give everyone an explanation.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.900
I’m going to return

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.750
all the money you put in before,

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.390
every single penny.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.750
But over these years,

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.880
Xin Sheng He hasn't done just one deal.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.820
If you still trust me,

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.360
I still have the resources

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.840
to lead us all forward.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.170
So you mean

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.210
Master Du has a new business opportunity?

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.720
You only need to choose:

If you put the money in the bank,

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.520

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.240
And you earned so much this time.

Haven't I been good enough to them?

Don't worry, Master Du.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.140
I'll continue to send messages to her.

For Jinshan's sake,

please let her off this time.

Why is making a living harder?

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.540

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:29.880
This type of absorbent paper

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.960
is soaked with LSD,

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.350
a potent semi-synthetic hallucinogen.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.830
A few micrograms can cause hallucinations.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.690
Large doses can be fatal.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.830
It's also known as "stamps" on the street.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.160
It's cheaper than meth,

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.680
making it popular among young drug users.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.520
For our investigation team,

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.920
it's extremely difficult to detect.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.340
According to intelligence in Xinji,

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.310
this is Tang Jinshan's first step

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.240
[New drug]

in her reform after taking power.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.800
She uses low-cost LSD stamps

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.530
to quickly capture the market.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:55.830
It seems the drug market

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.330
in Xinji will change dramatically.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.280
I fear

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.610
it will also be popular in Nanzhou.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.120
[When fishermen were working in Xinji,]

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:24.190
[they found a male body.]

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.520
She stole my account,

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.660
and killed him before I could.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:33.870
I must settle this score with her.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.730
That's how unpredictable this world is.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.480
She's the new master of Xin Sheng He.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.070
She has many people

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.270
and great influence.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.260
How can we fight against her?

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.570
Let me show you something.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.700
This is a new batch of goods

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.900
from Xin Sheng He.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:10.310
Extremely hard to get.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.940
I had to pull a lot of strings to get it.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.440
Don't underestimate this little thing.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.670
It sells so well.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.720
Nowadays, many places

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.150
like bars

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:25.460
and KTVs

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.740
are all using this.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.060
The cost is low too.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.080
This stuff

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.370
is garbage compared to meth.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.990
It doesn't matter if it's garbage.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.590
It turns into cash quickly.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.180
Xin Sheng He is dealing it, right?

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.510
Fine.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.530
Let's play along with them.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.400
Your place is really nice.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.160
And there's a pretty girl too.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.640
How many did he apply?

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.780
Just one patch.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.440
It's been going on for 12 hours now.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.120
Well, it seems your brother

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.290
really likes me.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.110
Had enough of looking?

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.970
Get up now.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.970
Tell the factory to increase production.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.790
Prepare fifty million yuan worth of goods.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.350
They are selling very well in Nanzhou.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.320
With Nanzhou as our center,

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.520
we'll expand outward

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.610
and quickly dominate the market.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.850
That's my style of doing business.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.050
Are you afraid

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:44.890
you'll have too much money to carry?

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:45.580
Can you handle

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.320
this much?

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:48.150
What do you think?

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.710
Miss Tang is generous.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.550
I'll expand production capacity

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.050
when I return.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.270
What about the money?

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.690
40% deposit.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:58.610
Is that enough?

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.040
With this much money, I could go to Mexico

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.350
to dig up cacti.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.310
The Ke brothers won’t disappoint you.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.440
In half a month,

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.920
we'll sweep the entire Nanzhou market.

Li Jun.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.880
He probably doesn't do ice.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.750
Otherwise he wouldn't have reacted

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.630
the way he did.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.600
He's into this stuff.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.000
Stamps.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.750
These things are troublesome.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.070
Small and hard to detect.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.460
It first became popular in nightclubs

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.510
in Xinji.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.590
I didn't expect it

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.390
to spread to Nanzhou so quickly.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.750
Xin Sheng He's product?

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.550
That's right.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.880
Tang Du died.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.240
Tang Jinshan took over.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.660
New boss, new moves.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.310
Any news about Luo Yuansu?

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.250
No.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.990
But I think

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.810
that Tang Jinshan was

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.470
also behind Mou Lang's death.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:09.280
But given Luo Yuansu's temper,

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.710
he won’t let it go.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.310
That's good.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:14.870
The fiercer they fight,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.260
the better it is for us.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.380
You can check

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.270
the source of this stamp.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.800
If I do all the work,

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.390
won't you be out of the job?

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:27.720
I can't be unemployed.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.980
I need to retire properly with a pension.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.730
I just want to advise you

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.400
to change your approach a bit.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.290
Don't just focus on the drug cook.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.960
Nice choice of words.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.720
"Change approach."

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.640
Should I focus on you if not the cook?

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.680
I'm your teacher.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.270
Show some respect.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.110

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.430

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.520
instead of becoming a wandering ghost.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:04.710
She's already dead.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.150
Why care about these things?

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.920
That's the older generation's way

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:15.840
of thinking.

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:20.370
She gave everything for this.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:23.840
But in the end,

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.880
not even her remains were left.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:29.950
Then why do you still help Mou

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:31.010
to do those things?

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.380
Sometimes in life,

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.980
one must learn to compromise.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:45.210
Especially when you're vulnerable.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:55.430
Better than nothing.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.540
At least better than being buried dirty.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:02.110
When do you plan to bury Uncle Ma?

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:26.320
Your father's grave

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.060
has been arranged.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:33.980
Take a look.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.000
Duozai,

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.840
let's put our past grievances aside first.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:44.800
Let Uncle Ma rest in peace soon.

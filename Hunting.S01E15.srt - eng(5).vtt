he truly knows the source?

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.630
It depends on who will question him.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.830
If it's you, he might not tell the truth.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.310

Why don't you take my place

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.640

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.480
Fine by me.

You win. I'd rather not argue with you.

Why not I make a report to you

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.110

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.790
Okay.

Alright. After a thorough check,

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.550
we found LSD stamps hidden

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.270
in both the guitar and the vinyl.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.440
So, we can basically confirm

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.960
that this is the way
they secretly transport goods.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.640

Well,

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:46.590
besides LSD stamps,

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.320
did he use other types of drugs?

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.030
No.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.660
I'm not sure.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.290
Where did he

00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.690
get the stamps?

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.350
I think...

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.840
he got them from a friend.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.790
A friend?

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:10.480

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.010
Who? What's his or her name?

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.830

Z-H-E, Zhe.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.870
Zhe often gave him stamps.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.270
Apart from Zhe,

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.400
did anyone else supply him with drugs?

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.720
I don't know.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.640
I really don't know.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.750
I dared not ask him,

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.000
or intervene with this matter.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.110

Why?

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.190

But...

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.570
he actually treated me quite well
in most of the time.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.270
Only when he used those stamps

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.400
would he turn into a different person.

right before your eyes

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.110
and died, right?

What's your opinion?

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.320
She strikes me as a foolish girl,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.150
for not breaking up with an abuser.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:54.210
Nothing else seems suspicious to me.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.920
But I always have a feeling

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.110
that she was trying too hard

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:58.520

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.590

I've been clean for several years now.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.780
I failed to control myself this time.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:22.470
It was my mistake.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.760
I promise

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.930
I'll never touch those things again.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.350
I'll report to Officer Ruan every week.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.080
Please,

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.120
give me one more chance.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.100
I can give you a chance,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.140
but you need to tell the truth.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.200
I promise.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.180
Is your record store dealing LSD stamps?

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.300
Well...

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.360
I don't know anything about that.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.680
I'm giving you a chance right now.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.680
Understand that.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.030
I really don't know.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.320
I'll ask you one more time.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.790
Is your record store

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.000
dealing LSD stamps?

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.200
Think carefully before you answer.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:04.810
Look at Cotton.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.200
So cute.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.390
Such an adorable child...

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.120
Officer Luo.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.970
You can't do this.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.330
What am I supposed to do?

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.350
You won't even tell me the truth.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.070
Let me tell you, Zhan Cui,

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.870
I can forgive your relapse.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.630
But if you're

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.700
involved in drug trafficking...

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.820
Nobody can help you.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:28.760
Nobody.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.120
Officer Luo,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.420
I swear on my life

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.000
and my daughter's

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.240
that I have nothing to do with this...

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.920
If you're not involved, prove it.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.920
Tell me the truth.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.000
At night, the boss

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.260
usually doesn't let me stay in the store.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.030
Especially on Tuesdays,

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.800
he makes me leave early.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.000
But he stays at the store

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.630
to receive deliveries.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.690
Isn't receiving deliveries normal?

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.850
But one day I accidentally saw

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.080
that the delivery

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.150
was baby formula.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.170
A record store

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.570
stocking baby formula?

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.600
Why?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.130
Doesn't that seem strange?

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.080
I didn't dare ask,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.000
and I didn't want to know.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.930
This has nothing to do with me.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.960
I just want a job
where I'm not discriminated against.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.920
I have a child to take care of.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.680
What's your relationship with Bai Di?

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:41.960
We met in a band before.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.600
Friends?

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.010
Not really.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.550
What about the deliveries?

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.080
Where might they be stored?

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.900
There's a warehouse in the store,

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.250
but I've been in there,

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.550
and there are only instruments,

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.480
no baby formula.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.960
So where do you think

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.690
the baby formula might be kept?

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:00.460
I don't know.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.480
All the receiving and shipping

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.320
is handled by him
and a few of his friends.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.520
I never get involved.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.390
And usually,

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.480
he doesn't allow me

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:11.640
into his office.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.080
Think carefully again.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.480
Is there anything else
you haven't told me?

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.570
Mom.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.460
Cotton.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:21.600
What's wrong?

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.960
Bad man!

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.230
Don't be mean to my mom!

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.400
Cotton.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.200
You can't talk like that.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.120
I didn't.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.670
I was just talking with your mom.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.390
Don't worry.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.710
He's a good man.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.460
Go play now.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.290
Go play.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.680
Have you thought it through?

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.990
There's nothing more to say?

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.940
Officer Luo,

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.210
that's all I know.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.400
I've told you everything.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.840
Don't tell anyone

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.870
about what we discussed today.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:52.780
Promise me.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.150
Don't touch that stuff again.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.480
Don't.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:16.710
Officer Luo!

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.360
If Bai Di is trafficking drugs,

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.260
will he be sentenced to death?

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.120
Do you want him to die?

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.350
He should get what he deserves.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:33.800

Completely consistent
with the forensic report.

So it has nothing to do with Mai Jiamin.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:43.890

Are you happy?

You didn't help me.

You owed me this.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.490
A couple should be indebted to each other.

you killed Li Jun

not entirely for my sake.

If it wasn't for you,

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.050
he wouldn't have died.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.680
Soft words but a hard heart.

You may also use me as your weapon.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.950
I put all his stuff

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.630
back into the record sleeves.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.950
Even if the police investigate thoroughly,

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.680
they won't trace it back to you.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.980
What was Li Jun's

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.690
reaction at that moment?

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.590
How to put it...

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.450
It was pretty scary.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.400
He was like he was high on meth.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.170
Like his soul left his body.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.360
I watched him smiling

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.030
as he walked
step by step toward the balcony.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.140
But he seemed

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.090
completely deranged.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:00.820
Can you see them?

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.280
Your wings.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.940
With the previous LSD stamps,

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.730
he could still maintain some sanity.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.960
But with your stuff,

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.830
he went completely insane.

What Tang Jinshan made was just trash.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:28.970
If you sabotage
Tang Jinshan's business like this,

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:30.620
do you think she'll just hand the account

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.950
back to you obediently?

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.050
Zhan Cui, open the door.

[Integrity in operation,
trust as the foundation]

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.710
Duozai recently crossed
a guy called Mr. Zhen.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.750
I feel like I've seen him
somewhere before.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.130
He seems to be watching me too.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.470
Watching you?

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.410
Do you think he's a cop?

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:04.790
I'm not sure now.

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:08.430
You've been too tired lately.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.200
No need to be so paranoid.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.440
Is it necessary?

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.650
I think you've been
scared since childhood.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.070
Yeah.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.690
I've been scared since I was little.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.670
Cotton.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.610
Look at this.

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:31.110
Who is this beautiful lady?

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:31.810
Mommy.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.030
It's Mommy, right?

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:35.350
Your mom didn't mean
to scare you just now,

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:36.000
right?

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.510
Right.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.840
Mommy was just playing with me.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.550
That's right.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:40.880
Cotton is such a good girl.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.680
Your mom didn't mean it, did she?

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.880
If you hadn't come,

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:11.440
I really don't know

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.670
what I might have done.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.300
Besides the information you just provided,

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.530
is there anything else you're hiding?

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.510
I've told you everything I know.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.150
I didn't mean to relapse.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.270
Are you sure

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.610
all the drugs are hidden in the store?

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:41.010
Bai Di is usually very cautious.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:42.620
However,

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.990
he recently received a shipment

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.300
and seems to have hidden it in his office.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.800
I told all this

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.430
to that Officer Luo as well.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.440
But

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.080
I don't think he's a good person.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.620
Captain Luo...

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:03.440
About that

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.400
Officer Luo,

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.690
don't worry about him.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.960
He won't bother you again.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.960
We'll handle it,

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:08.550
okay?

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:09.230
Just relax.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.190
You guys take care of this.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.850
I'll wait for you downstairs.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:14.910
It's okay.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.000
Is Officer Luo Zhan Cui mentioned

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.890
Uncle Yang?

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.550
Who else would

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:28.680
impersonate Captain Luo besides him?

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.760
I'll go check out
the surroundings of the music store.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:47.630
Officer Luo.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:49.800
Please don't use

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.650
my name to scam people anymore.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.650
The worst part is you didn't
even succeed in your scam.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:54.910
Zhan Cui told us

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.230
you didn't look like
a decent person at all to her.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:58.320
If you people were smarter,

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.920
would I need
to go through all this trouble?

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.230
What's with this "you people" talk?

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.960
You're crazy.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.920
We're police officers.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.670
We value honesty and evidence.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.620
Zhi'an, don't learn from him.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.800
I found information about this pharmacy.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.960
The legal representative
is named Li Haixing,

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.480
a woman.

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:11.840
A woman?

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:13.960
Did you get a good look?

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.490
Was that person Luo Yuansu?

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.970
If I was certain,
I would have arrested him already.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:20.830
He was wearing a mask.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.710
I just thought his build looked similar.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.840
You don't even think before you speak.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.190
Could Duozai's showing up at the pharmacy

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:28.590
really be a coincidence?

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.880
He went to the music store first,

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.340
then went to the pharmacy.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:36.760
No way that was just coincidence.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.490
Impossible.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.540
I've said it all along.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.540
That Duozai

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.830
is definitely hiding something from us.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.280
I believe Duozai

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.940
wouldn't work for Luo Yuansu.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.840
He might have some other reason.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.770
What did you say?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.930
You believe him?

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.320
I just do.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.280
Besides, we don't have any evidence.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.400
We can't falsely accuse people.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.460
Wu Zhi'an, what did I tell you before?

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.110
Someone like him

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.880
can easily change in that environment.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.410
Exactly.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.070
Anyway, I believe

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:03.870
he wouldn't work for Luo Yuansu.

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:05.210
Alright.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.440
Alright.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:05.960
Alright.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.980
Waste of breath.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.590
Are you still in contact

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:09.520
with Duozai now?

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:11.320
No.

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:13.460
Then find a way to contact him.

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.280
Send a few more people
to watch the pharmacy.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.360
I've already shown my face there.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.840
It's not convenient for me to go again.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.070
Like I need you
to tell me how to do my job.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:24.070
Are you a teacher?

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.070
You're like one.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.230
Fine.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:28.480
Listen.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.280
In situations like this in the future,

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.590
talk to me first.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:32.070
You scared them off.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.480
Alright, alright.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.280
You'd better catch him.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.510
Don't contradict yourself.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:36.630
Stop mimicking the way I talk, will you?

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:37.630
Then speak standard Mandarin.

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.490
I am speaking standard Mandarin.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.360
You're so...

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.230
Wait and see when I catch him.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:41.880
Fine.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.140
Check the Tongle Formula Factory again.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:52.810
Okay.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:54.880
Wait, wait!

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.940
What's that smell?

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:57.830
Found it in the trash.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.720
I only know he's called Mr. Zhen.

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:06.430
He used to hang out with my dad.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.770
What's wrong?

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.950
Does he have connections with the police?

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:15.270
Someone like him
would be too busy avoiding the police.

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.720
The pharmacy is closed.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.940
I'll contact you if anything comes up.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:20.110
Okay.

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.130
This seems way too simple.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.290
Even I could make it.

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:49.910
Only those who have actually used it

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.250
know it's not simple at all.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.420
Want to try it?

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:05.100
Curious?

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.940
This is different from meth.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.100
After you use it,

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:12.230
nothing bad will happen.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:13.870
And it's fun.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:16.070
Do you want to try?

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:19.700
Is it safe?

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.710
It's fine.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.070
Really?

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.110
Yeah.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:23.640

You're disappointed in me,

Actually, I'm quite disappointed
in myself too.

was wrong with Bai Di all along?

But I've been pretending not to know

because he knows everything about me.

Based on the intelligence
from our undercover agent,

we've located
the Tongle Formula Factory.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.040
We also contacted our colleagues
at the Xiangnan Narcotics Control Brigade

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.370
to gather information.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.270
We learned that previously,

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.360
someone had made an anonymous report

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.190
that this factory
had been manufacturing drugs.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.070
They checked the place,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.240
but didn't find anything suspicious.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.120
They only took some photos,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.580
which they just sent over.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.190
The photos have been sent
to your phones.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.240
Since it was an anonymous tip
without evidence,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.900
they didn't conduct
a thorough investigation.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.570
This fourth photo...

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.240
The person in the upper right corner,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.840
why does he look so familiar?

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:52.830
Yes.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.330
He looks familiar.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.090
He looks like that guy
from Fengmao Village,

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.020
Mou Yikuo.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.340
Mou Yikuo

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.720
is definitely the man in this photo.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.390
It can't be wrong.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.570
This Mou Yikuo

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.960
used to work for Mou Haidong.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.630
His presence at the milk powder factory

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.390
means there must be something wrong there.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.480

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.290

then Baiye Music Store

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.830
must be their distribution channel.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.780
Zhan Cui said

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.950
Bai Di received

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:17.950
a new shipment last night.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.810
It's likely hidden in his office.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:20.950
Good.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.800
Let's scout it out tonight

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.660
and try to take down
this distribution point first.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.039
No one will bother you over there.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.789
You must be much happier now, right?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.610
Yes.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.650
He's completely free now.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.260
How did you find this place?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.970
It isn't difficult.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.840
Uncle Ma.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.260
I brought your favorite liquor.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.070
I put it here.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.390
Take your time.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.210
Also,

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.320
you have my word.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.150
I will

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.670
avenge you.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.720
Revenge for what?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.900
It seems you still don't know

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.630
why he died.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.930
What do you know?

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.320
Stop looking at me like that.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.780
Uncle Ma's death

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.410
was caused by someone
nicknamed Cook.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.030
Who told you that?

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.870
Regarding what happened in Nanzhou,

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.200
if I want to know something,
I have my ways.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.650
Do you know him?

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.400
I don't know whom you're talking about.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.290
I heard he has a connection
to Mou Haidong.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.320
I only care about

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.390
what he has to do with my dad's death.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.250
He was just a fall guy for the Cook.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.510
A fall guy!

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.970
Are you kidding me?

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.730
Were you close to my father?

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.670
Why do you think you have the right
to avenge him?

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:10.800
Why are you so angry?

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.210
Do you know the Cook?

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.240
Thank you for coming to visit him.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.830
Open the door!

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.890
What do you want?

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:19.870
Answer a few questions.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.120
If you don't open up,
I'll call the police!

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.120
Go ahead.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.270
The police would also like to know

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.150
why you went to Baiye Music Store.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:29.960
What for?

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.790
Let the police ask me then.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.030
I'll talk to the police.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.760
Why should I tell you anything?

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.380
Don't be angry.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.870
You are so irritable.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.650
How about this?

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.270
You can ask me questions,

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.330
and in exchange, I get to ask you some.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.790
There must be things you want to know.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:49.590
You ask first.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:51.770
Fine.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.030
I'll ask first.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.480
Okay.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.120
What are you investigating?

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.980
The Cook.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.610
Why?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.840
Your turn.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.350
The one in the pharmacy yesterday

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.480
was the Cook, wasn't it?

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.120
Yes.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.690
Why are you looking for him?

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.430
He's my enemy.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:22.840
Alright.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.680
Your question?

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.510
Where is he?

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.850
I don't know.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.930
I really don't know.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.480
How did you know
I went to Baiye Music Store?

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.740
I ran into you while looking for someone.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.680
Why did you go there?

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:52.840
It's a drug den.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.270
You want to report it, right?

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:55.790
Yes.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.130
Can I leave now?

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.750
Just answer one last question.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.580
Who's this older guy?

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:29.030
My buddy, Mr. Zhen.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.820
Azhen.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.990
Your buddy is
much better looking than you.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.380
Are you kidding me?

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.890
Did you bring the stuff?

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.360
Mr. Fu, have a drink.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.110
Hello, Mr. Fu.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.510
Drink all you want tonight.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:48.770
It's on him.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.630
Drink whatever you want.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.360
It's on me.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.000
Thank you, Mr. Zhen.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Don't mention it.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:55.000
Thanks.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.510
This

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.910
is the premium stuff
in the club these days.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.260
It's more expensive than before,

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.950
but the high

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.610
is like nothing else.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.500
Who's selling it?

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.140
It's just a phone number.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.600
I've never met the seller.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.570
Give me the number.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.020
I'll send it to you.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:29.620
Good.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:32.390
Sent it.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.860
Thanks, Mr. Fu.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.220
What are you looking at?

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:40.130
The beautiful ladies.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.440
You stay here

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.500
and watch me dance.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.590
Go ahead.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:12.960
Four-Eyes Hao.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.150
Why am I dancing alone?

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:15.010
Four-Eyes Hao,

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.060
get down.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.440
Who are you?

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:21.760
Can't you see I'm dancing?

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.890
Don't try to stop me.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Are you sober now?

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.080
Duozai!

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.630
I miss you so much.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:41.610
Why are you so late?

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.460
Why did you...

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.020
Why are you hitting me?

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.420
Are you sober now?

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.820
Let's have fun together.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:53.630
Let's go.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.200
Someone's fighting!

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.280
Get him!

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.580
Please leave.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:58.980
This is my friend.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:00.240
I want to take him away.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.140
I'm not his friend.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:02.760
Take him away.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.440
Do you understand?

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.400
Did you hear that?

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.800
-Take him away.
-Get out!

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:07.720
Duozai!

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.260
Go! Go!

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:12.440
Let go!

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.460
Get your hands off me!

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.400
I'm a paying customer here.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.970
You bastard, let go!

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.600
Let go!

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:26.370
You bastard!

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.060
Are you here
to trash my place?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:41.550
Fight!

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:43.050
Fight!

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.080
Fight!

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.680
I've got these two covered.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.690
Kill him!

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.240
Fight!

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.470
Fight!

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.730
Come on!

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:11.480
Good hit!

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:17.960
Grab him!

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.190
He's getting away! He's escaping!

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.920
Boss!

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.240
Get him!

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.560
Why are you helping me up?

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:29.350
Hit him!

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.430
Don't let him escape!

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:33.400
Duozai.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.440
Four-Eyes Hao is such a disappointment.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.280
Four-Eyes Hao?

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.440
I'm talking about you.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.230
He's talking about me.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:40.440
I'll help him get clean.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.490
Rehab?

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.290
Come with me. I'll help you.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.800
No thanks.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:45.590
I have my own way.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:46.120
Let's go.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.400
Where are we going?

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.860
You don't trust me, do you?

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.360
Where are you going?

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.220
I don't like owing people favors.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.060
But today I owe you one.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.300
When will you pay me back?

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.760
After I take care of him.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.190
Let's go.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.050
Deal with what?

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:22.700
You know him?

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.290
Just an acquaintance.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.250
That's pretty loyal of you.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.660
You stood up for him like that.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.550
How can I survive out here
without loyalty?

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:37.880
Do you know Fu Lao?

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.220
Yes.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.160
I know a lot of people.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.880
We've met before.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.360
I know.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.960
You were Li Jun's woman.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.500
I heard he died.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:55.340
Overdosed on drugs.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.930
Who are you with now?

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:04.170
No one.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.690
Got any stuff?

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:13.590
What stuff?

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:14.720
You know what I mean.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.590
The new stuff from this spot.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.510
Listen to me,

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:21.790
you should stay away

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.230
from that stuff.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:27.440
Let's have a drink sometime.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.190
Get him!

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.360
Don't go!

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.660
How did you get hurt so badly?

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:40.360
Got into a fight.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.550
Isn't this just

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:42.950
par for the course for me?

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:46.320
Is everything okay?

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.560
I ran into Duozai today.

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.840
Where?

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.720
Near the music store.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.970
He went there again?

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.400
I feel like he knew

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.130
something was going to happen
at the music store.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.230
They seem to have known before us

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:15.690
that the music store
was selling LSD stamps.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.970
And then they deliberately led us there.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.470
Who are they?

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.620
Duozai.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.890
And Luo Yuansu.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.540
How do you know?

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.010
How did you track down the music store?

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.200
We found it at Li Jun's place.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.010
A record called 'White Night.'

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.330
Li Jun's place?

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.030
A record?

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.450
But in theory,

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:47.710
the Baiye Music Store

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:49.000
has already been taken down by us.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.360
So why are there even more

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.960
LSD stamps on the market now?

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.320
It feels like someone

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.050
deliberately led us
to take down the music store.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.030
Why would they do that?

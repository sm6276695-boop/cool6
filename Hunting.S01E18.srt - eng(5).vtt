right?

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.730
You're all related.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.720
So what's your relationship

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.960
with Mou Haidong?

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.260
We're just neighbors,

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.950
nothing more than that.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:02.550
Right.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.670
All of you in the whole village

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.270
are neighbors and relatives.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.960
So are you and him

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.840
close,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.270
or do you just know his name?

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.230
Just...

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.210
I just know his name.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.340
We're not close.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.270
We're not close.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:20.650
Good.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.060
Show him the photo.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.330
You just know his name, right?

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:31.810
Take a closer look.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.840
The person in the photo

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.150
looks a bit like me.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.900
Coincidence.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.280
Alright,

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.030
no problem.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.550
I understand.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.630
Usually,

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.330
suspects like you

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.810
refuse to admit what they've done.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.550
But

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.030
I need to tell you something.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.820
According to

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.090
the "Criminal Procedure Law

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.320
of the People's Republic of China",

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:57.960
when handling cases,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.120
we do need confession from suspects.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.960
But we value more factual evidence,

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.830
which means physical evidence.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.110
No, officer,

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.830
I really don't know him well.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.480
I don't know about his drug business.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.720
I'm not his drug cook.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.550
Didn't the LSD stamps sell well?

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.080
Why not sell those anymore?

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.480
Making LSD stamps is easy.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.130
Making meth requires skills.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.800
I don't have the skills.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.030
Right.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.930
So you were making the LSD stamps before,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.200
because it doesn't require many skills.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.700
You're quite deeply involved, aren't you?

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.500

Who is Mou Haidong's drug cook?

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.240
I don't know.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.750
I think you're well aware

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.750
that Mou Haidong has been executed.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.720
So what are you hesitating about?

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.980
What are you afraid of?

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.720
Is someone threatening you?

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.550
No.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.290
Then speak up if you're not afraid.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.000
I'm just a...

OK?

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.530
Don't make things up anymore.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.030
Fine.

What do you want to know?

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.600
I'll tell you everything,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.200
but

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.270
can I get a reduced sentence?

right?

Multiple offenses combined for punishment.

I don't need to tell you

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.650
what your fate will be, do I?

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.140
Mou Haidong has an illegitimate son.

He's actually the most skilled drug cook

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.700
in the business.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.560
Do you know this illegitimate son?

I've met him a few times.

People in the village

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.730
used to call him

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.720
Pigpen Boy.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.960
I can say one more thing.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.200
His mother was also in this business.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.010
Mou Haidong cultivated him.

You want him to quit drugs with you.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.190
You know a lot about police,

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.740
don't you?

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:56.910
But let me tell you,

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.380
you don't know me.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.220
This knife is yours.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:01.960
I was acting in self-defense.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.480
You're a police officer.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.320
You can't kill people.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.720
You're not a human being.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.880
You're a bastard.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.230
[End]

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:22.440
What's wrong?

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.790
I never expected

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:25.590
that Mr. Zhen was actually a cop.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.710
Get up.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.710
You're not dead yet! Hurry up and go!

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.360
Go!

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.210
Kill him.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:37.880
Fine.

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:41.180
Come here.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:57.730
Go to hell!

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.250
What are you doing?

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.920
There's no time.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.480
Stop right there.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.430
Don't run.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.600
Get in the car.

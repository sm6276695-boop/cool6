00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.760
Wei.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.040
What's wrong with you?

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.160
I'm fine.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.320
Let's go inside.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.480
Come on.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.200
(Subject: Who is the real victim?)

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.120
(Justice Is Mine)

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.120
(Episode 9)

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400
Press it.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.680
Let me help you up.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.960
Come on.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.440
Slowly.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.000
Watch your head.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.080
These are antibiotics.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.280
This is an anti-inflammatory.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.760
Here.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080
Come on.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.600
Take this first.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.000
Are you okay?

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.600
Wei.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.760
It looks like...

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.080
the bullet is still inside.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.240
How did you get shot?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.680
Also, what's in that car outside?

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.120
Firearms.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.360
I stole them for Qi Chang Rong.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.160
But I haven't told him how to give it yet.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.360
You really stole them for him?

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.760
That's too dangerous.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.280
You have a wife and a son at home.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.440
I did it for my wife and son.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.960
Now it's come to this.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.200
You don't think you're not responsible, do you?

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.800
Why would I think that?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.519
If I were that kind of person,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.720
you wouldn't have come to me.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.600
First, dress your wound.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.840
Come on.

00:03:41.841 --> 00:03:42.920
Be careful.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.240
Yi Wei.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.560
I have something to do today.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.800
I can't take you to school.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800
Do you want me to call you a cab?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.040
It's okay. I'll take the bus.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400
Whose car is this?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520
It's my friend's.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.520
It'll be gone soon.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.800
You're late. Go to school.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.280
Wei.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.760
Wei.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400
This is bad.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.040
He really has a fever.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.080
Hello.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.280
I don't care who you are.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.040
Tell Cao Wei Er,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.640
it's no use hiding.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.800
Wei.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.120
Wei.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.520
How are you? Can you still hold on?

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.280
Wei Wei.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.160
You guys go ahead and eat.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.520
Grandma,

00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:31.760
did something happen?

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.800
It's nothing.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.400
I just want to ask you something.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.360
Come. Sit down first.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.720
Someone just called you.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.240
Hello?

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.960
This is Cao Wei Er.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.040
If you're not dead, it means you've got the firearms.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.920
I'll give it to you today.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.200
Why didn't you give it to me yesterday?

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.280
This has gotten out of hand.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.440
How dare I run around?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.080
I wouldn't want to seek death.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.400
I swear on my son.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.560
Everything is in my hands.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.159
I'll give you two hours.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.680
Bring it to me now.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680
Qi Chang Rong.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.120
Shouldn't you be honest with me?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.880
I'm in front of the gods now.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.320
I'll make sure your wife and child are safe for life.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.319
I, Qi Changrong, am a man of my word.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.320
Good.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.880
That's good enough.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.240
Wei.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.600
How can you go in such a state?

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.200
He threatened me with my son.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.120
I have to go.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800
But I planted a bomb under the car.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.560
If he opens the trunk door,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.160
I'll blow him up.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.680
Say no more.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.440
I'll go.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.800
I'll go.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.160
Lately,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.720
I've been feeling...

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.360
something is wrong.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.400
I guess...

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.520
your dad is in some kind of trouble.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.600
I've never seen him like this.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.200
I don't think I'm wrong.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.360
Something happened to him.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.560
You know, I used to be a judge.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.160
I've seen everything.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.079
Right now, your dad must be being threatened...

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.360
or even blackmailed.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200
Wei Wei.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.240
If you know anything,

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.520
you have to tell me, okay?

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.200
I don't know.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.760
Dad never tells me these things.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.600
Qi Chang Rong is very suspicious.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.120
We can't let him know...

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.720
that we're sending someone else.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.920
Let me know when you get there.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.560
Let me contact him.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.120
Okay.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.640
I'll take you to the hospital first,

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.640
then come back and drive.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.720
I can't go to the hospital.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.560
They can tell it's a gunshot wound.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.240
If they compare the bullet,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.120
I'll be dead.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.840
But the bullet is still in your stomach.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.160
If you don't go to the hospital,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200
you'll die anyway.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.120
I'm not going.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.280
Deliver the stuff first.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.160
You owe me this.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.240
You can't go back on your word.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.560
What should I do? Tell me.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.320
Hey, what are you doing?

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.240
I'm not asking you to kill anyone.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.440
Take it to protect yourself.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.080
Lately,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.640
have you encountered...

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.240
anything strange?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.120
Like in the middle of the night,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.400
have you received any strange calls?

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.559
Or have you noticed more strangers...

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.080
around your house,

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.800
as if they are spying on you?

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.080
No.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.040
- No? - No.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.480
No.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.880
I still want you to stay at my house for a few days.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.520
See what's going on.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
There's no need.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.280
It's not that serious.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.000
I'm not discussing it with you.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.119
Go home and pack your clothes.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.120
Then, move into my place.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.120
- But my dad... - I'll explain it to him.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.440
Judge Qin,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.720
don't be scared.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.640
I'm fine.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.800
I'm not scared.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.080
Don't fall asleep.

00:10:41.081 --> 00:10:42.160
Keep talking to me.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.920
Talk?

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.080
About what?

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.240
I remember now.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.240
We were classmates in elementary school.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.400
That day,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.000
did you recognize me?

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480
Your Honor.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.759
As a police officer,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.799
the defendant should clearly know...

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.040
his responsibility to society,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.360
including protecting citizens' lives and property.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.280
But the defendant knew the law and broke it,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.000
and embezzled stolen money.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.559
This goes against the public's...

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.720
expectations of civil servants.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.319
I hope Your Honor...

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.520
will impose a severe penalty.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.000
I know I'm not a model police officer...

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.400
who is incorruptible and dedicated to public service.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.040
But I've never committed murder, arson, or injustice.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.160
Because I didn't do it,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.360
I got in the way of others' source of income.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.480
So they framed me,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.880
saying I stole the money...

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.160
at the scene.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.079
The defendant is charged...

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.200
with knowingly breaking the law while enforcing the law,

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.560
and stealing the stolen money.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.240
Based on the evidence presented in court, first,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.559
there is no direct evidence...

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.800
to prove that the defendant stole the money.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.000
Second, there is also no direct evidence...

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.760
that the defendant put the money in his own car.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.200
The court's judgment...

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.680
is not based on a few words,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.080
but on evidence.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.520
Therefore, I hereby declare...

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.999
that the existing evidence is insufficient...

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.360
to confirm the theft.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.520
The defendant's charge is not established.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.280
Judge Qin.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.880
Thank you for clearing my name.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.360
It wasn't me.

00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:27.120
It was the law and evidence that helped you.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.360
You don't think if another judge had presided,

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.800
the outcome would have been the same, do you?

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.360
I don't have to go to jail for something I didn't do.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.200
I have you to thank for that.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.240
Take care in the future.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.560
Thank you.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.920
- Actually, you... - You always got held back.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.880
Wei, are you all right?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Wei.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.400
Hello, Wei.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.400
I...

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.480
I'm fine.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.759
Although in the end,

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.280
they dismissed me for misconduct,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.720
because of you,

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.360
I wasn't wrongly imprisoned.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.920
I still have to thank you.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.880
I also know...

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.000
that gangsters later harassed me,

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.560
and you're the one who secretly helped me out.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.440
Consider it me returning a favor.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.680
I'm quite happy.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.600
We can still be friends.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.480
Having a judge as a friend...

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.400
makes me look good.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.680
But your judge friend...

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.280
has done a lot of disgraceful things lately.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.360
For my son's sake,

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.280
I have to do it.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360
Wei.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.760
I'm sorry.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.720
I didn't expect things to turn out this way.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200
Honestly,

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.080
if it weren't for you,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.280
I might still be in prison.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.040
It's also because of you...

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.400
that I'm in this situation.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.280
Do you think I made a profit...

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.560
a loss?

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.400
Hang in there.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.679
I'll settle this with you...

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.880
when I get back, okay?

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.560
Don't sleep.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.000
Your dad is at home.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.399
He said he has something to do today.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.440
Maybe he didn't drive.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.479
Go upstairs and pack your things.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.760
I will wait for you here.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.160
Madam.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.440
I've been suspended for almost a month.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.559
The Complaints Department questioned me,

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.640
but they couldn't come to a conclusion.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.640
They said I'll have to ask you if I can be reinstated.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.840
I mean,

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.280
whether you can be reinstated...

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.920
depends on you.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.560
Madam, I've told you many times.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.279
I may be from the Old City District,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.960
but I'm still a cop.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.880
Madam,

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.040
I have a tip on Qi Chang Rong.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.360
They say Han Lie has the guts to kill in the Old City District.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.520
That's directly provoking the Old City Gang.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.320
Tell me something I don't know.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.080
Qi Chang Rong's men are working on a batch of firearms.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.320
He said there will be a good show soon.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.840
Is the information reliable?

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.640
You can check which news...

00:17:34.641 --> 00:17:35.880
didn't get published yesterday.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.920
Report back tomorrow.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.080
Yes, madam!

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.240
Thank you, madam!

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.640
I've asked around.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.360
There was indeed news that didn't get published yesterday.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.360
Maybe it's because it's a bit sensitive.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.240
It's not sensitive.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.480
It's embarrassing.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.120
Get to the point.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.440
It's a shipment of firearms confiscated by Customs.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.560
It should be stored in the warehouse after the case is over.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.479
But when it was sent to the warehouse,

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.520
it was robbed.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.560
The Emergency Uni was there to intercept.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.360
However, the robber threw a grenade.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.720
He got away.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.479
The public has no way of knowing...

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.760
when weapons are stored in the warehouse.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.640
There must be a mole.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.160
That's not all.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.160
Of what they stole, two boxes were firearms.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.320
One box was yellow TNT.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.519
If these firearms are used for a massacre,

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.640
it would be disastrous.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.520
Is this case...

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.000
being followed up by an investigation team?

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.520
Yes.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.799
If this case...

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.360
is truly related to Qi Chang Rong,

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.440
then he's using Ma Shan Bao's death...

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.200
to declare war on Han Kui Long.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.439
Are these two cases...

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.640
related?

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.080
Tang Xuan.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.639
- Boss. - You're just in time.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.640
I have something to report.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.960
- You two may leave. - Yes, sir.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.120
Yes, sir.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.920
What is it?

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.960
The Internal Investigations Unit is here.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.480
They specifically asked to see you.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.640
I'll sit in.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.480
But I have no say.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.880
This is Senior Inspector Tang Xuan.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.160
Superintendent Gu Bai Sheng of Internal Investigations.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.680
Superintendent Gu.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.680
Have a seat.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.559
We arranged this meeting...

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.079
because we have some questions...

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.120
that we'd like you, Inspector Tang, to confirm them for us.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080
Yes, sir.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.199
Let's get this straight before we start.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.039
Are you in charge of Ma Shanbao's case?

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.040
Yes.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.800
Is there anything suspicious?

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.200
What kind of suspicion...

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.480
are you referring to?

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.199
We're from the Internal Investigations Unit.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.200
What do you think?

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.560
We suspect there's a mole in your team.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.680
Who do you suspect?

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.360
On what grounds?

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.000
These two photos...

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.160
were taken after Ma Shanbao was detained.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.840
Were you there?

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.160
No, I wasn't.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.760
How did he get hurt?

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.000
According to the statements...

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.680
from my colleagues, Liang Jie and Guo Hua,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.159
he resisted arrest,

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.160
was agitated,

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.160
and attacked the officers.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.359
Those injuries were caused...

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.640
when subduing him.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.240
As far as I know,

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.719
he knew what was going on,

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.720
so he didn't complain.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.840
Yes.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.200
He didn't complain.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.840
What do you suspect then?

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.200
I looked into Guo Hua's background.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.479
When he first joined the force,

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.519
he had a partner.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.519
He was killed on a mission...

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.520
to stop a shootout in the Old City District.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.719
Since then, he has used excessive force...

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.760
on Old City gang members more than once.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.800
What does this have to do with the mole?

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.080
Ma Shan Bao was electrocuted during the interrogation.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.360
I'll say it again.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.760
Ma Shanbao's injuries...

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.760
were not sustained during the interrogation...

00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:02.679
No, you just need to answer me...

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.559
if anyone in the police station...

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.840
electrocuted Ma Shan Bao.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.080
- Yes. - Who was it?

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.080
Guo Hua.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.440
But that doesn't mean he's the mole.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.080
Who did he sell the information to?

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.000
Han Kui Long's gangster family.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.720
Do you have proof?

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.079
I've sent two cops to jail...

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.999
because they wanted to collude with the Han family...

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.640
to deal with the Old City Gang.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.720
Superintendent Gu,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.080
fighting fire with fire...

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.560
might actually save more time than arresting...

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.040
those genuinely corrupt officers.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.920
- Tell me more. - Tang Xuan.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.839
You don't need to record...

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.920
what she just said.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.080
What are you doing?

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.880
Hello.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.360
Are you there yet?

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040
Almost.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.480
Leave as soon as you get there.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.560
I'll inform Qi Chang Rong.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.440
Don't worry.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.040
I'll wait until you've left safely.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.080
Okay. Keep an eye on your phone.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.480
Hang in there, okay?

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.960
Did you know Guo Hua met Han Lie?

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.520
Or let me ask you this.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.080
Did you approve of him...

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.600
contacting Han Lie?

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.559
Even if they met,

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.440
it could have been for an investigation.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.559
Of course. Contacting criminals is usually...

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.759
to gather intelligence.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.080
Isn't that right, Inspector Tang?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.560
Were you at the scene of Han Gang's car accident?

00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.680
No, I wasn't.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.680
The officer in charge...

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.880
was Officer Guo Hua.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.079
So, the traffic accident report and the forensic report...

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080
were both handed to you by him?

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.720
It should have been Guo Hua and Liang Jie.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.999
In your recollection,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.439
did the report mention...

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.600
an asthma inhaler was found at the scene?

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640
I don't remember.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.279
Wait a minute. You mean...

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.719
you don't remember whether the report mentioned the inhaler...

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.440
or whether the report failed to mention that the inhaler was found?

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.360
I know an inhaler was found...

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.719
and submitted for DNA testing.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.760
Why wasn't it mentioned in the original report?

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.560
I don't know.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.320
It was an oversight on my part.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.200
An oversight?

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.079
Or did someone deliberately...

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.360
hide such an important piece of evidence?

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.960
- Why would they do that? - I don't know.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.080
Maybe it's like you said, fighting fire with fire.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.319
They're deliberately creating conflict between the two gangs...

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.639
and profit from it.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.320
When they realized it was useless, they handed over the evidence.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.400
That's just your speculation.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.600
Do you have any evidence?

00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:11.160
That's strange. How did you get your hands on that inhaler?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.599
Anyway, it ended up...

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.880
in the investigation.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.240
Anyway, it...

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.439
Who made the decision for Ma Shan Bao...

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.440
to turn into a state's witness?

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.319
His lawyer.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.079
Was the decision to release him on bail...

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.560
made before or after the DNA test result was released?

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.399
Can I understand it this way?

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.159
If the result is a match,

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.239
then it should be an official indictment,

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.440
instead of release on bail.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.040
Investigating a case is a...

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.880
process to verify if there are any doubts.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.839
We suspect that Ma Shan Bao...

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.399
has something to do with the accident.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.679
Because the car he was driving...

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.120
was the one that got into the accident.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.959
We let him out on bail...

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.159
because we hoped he could provide some information...

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.240
for us to solve the case.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.319
These are our strategies for solving cases.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.840
Superintendent Gu, you should know.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.120
Yes. We use these strategies all the time.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.600
It's not against the rules.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.480
Who else knew about Ma Shan Bao's release on bail?

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.640
Me,

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.680
the judge,

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.080
the prosecutor,

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.320
his lawyer,

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.200
- and... - Guo Hua.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.680
My whole team...

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.959
and the colleague who was driving.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.080
Many people knew about it.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.879
Ma Shan Bao was killed by a suspected hitman...

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.359
sent by Han Kui Long less than half a day after being granted bail,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.360
Inspector Tang.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.959
So the key question isn't...

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.239
whether the information was leaked.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.679
It's who leaked the information.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.880
This is just circumstantial speculation.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.879
You can't just deduce that Guo Hua is the mole.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.800
Who said Guo Hua was the mole?

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.960
That day, around 3am,

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.599
I suddenly received an order...

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.640
to check the CCTV footage.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.880
Before I saw the footage, I thought it was Guo Hua.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.640
Turns out it wasn't.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.880
It was your birthday, right?

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.600
Have you arrived yet?

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.240
I'll let you know when I have.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.760
Why is it so quiet over there?

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.600
Hey, Wei.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.040
Don't mess with me.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.880
I'm in the toilet.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.360
Nature calls.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.960
Anyway, I'll let you know when I get there.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.880
If you had watched the entire CCTV footage,

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.080
you would have seen in the end that I rejected that gift.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.439
Why would Han Lie send you...

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.559
such an expensive gift?

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.560
That watch costs over 100,000.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.560
I don't know.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.479
- What do you think? - Who targeted you?

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.760
Tell me who framed you.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.120
Maybe you should ask...

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.440
who requested to view this CCTV footage.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.479
Maybe if you find that person,

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.879
you'll find out who gave Ma Shan Bao's information...

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.040
to the Han family.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.840
The Han family?

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.719
You went to see Han Kui Long in prison,

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.280
more than once, right?

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.160
Everyone knows about it.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.359
Even if Han Kui Long is in prison,

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.759
with just one word of his,

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.520
he can cause an absolute ruckus outside.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.480
I went to tell him...

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.399
that I could let him see his son.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.919
But in exchange,

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.920
he would give us time...

00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:21.479
to find the real culprit behind the crash.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.480
He had to stay out of it,

00:28:22.481 --> 00:28:24.680
stop taking the law into his own hands and killing innocents.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.519
How do you explain Xu Xiong of the Old City Gang...

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.520
being splashed with hot oil?

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.799
Ma Shan Bao was killed.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.959
That's not interfering?

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.159
That's not taking the law into his own hands,

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.160
killing innocents?

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.400
I'd like to ask if this is an official interrogation.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.240
Who are you testifying against?

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.600
Do you have any evidence?

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.840
Tang Xuan.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.320
We received a complaint from a lawyer.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.840
She's going to report you.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.200
Zhou Luo Wen?

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.120
The complainant claims...

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.720
Ma Shan Bao once said...

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.079
that at the time of the accident,

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080
he was somewhere else,

00:29:04.081 --> 00:29:05.400
stealing an old Mercedes.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.159
She complained that you knew about...

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.239
such an important alibi,

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.680
but didn't check it out right away.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.879
All suspects come up with a million reasons...

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.080
to get away with their crimes.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.759
I have to filter and analyze them to determine the truth.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.679
It took you three days to find this car.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.079
Who set the car on fire?

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.159
That's what I want to know.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.959
Who tipped off his accomplice, Xiao Bei,

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.960
and made him disappear on his own?

00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:26.759
If I didn't have to sit here and let you waste my time,

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.519
- I'd still be investigating these. - Please answer my question!

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.520
I don't know.

00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:30.879
I've never even heard of that name.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.760
I just want to know how long you're going to keep asking.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.000
Until I'm satisfied.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.920
Are you there yet?

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.640
I just entered the abandoned district.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.280
Turn left.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.360
You're almost there.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.160
Wei.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.880
Do we have to blow up these firearms?

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.680
What else can we do?

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.759
Do you know that these firearms...

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.160
will kill a lot of people?

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.680
They must not fall into Qi Chang Rong's hands.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.960
Let's deal with him together.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.560
That way, Bao's case...

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.720
can be completely...

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.040
resolved.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.080
Only then will Sha Sha and the kids be safe.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.240
Qi Chang Rong is calling.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.560
I'll call you back.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.320
Hello?

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.440
Have you arrived?

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.279
Come in ten minutes.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.440
I don't need ten minutes.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.720
I'll be right there.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.559
- Hello. - Leave now.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.240
Qi Chang Rong will be right there.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.400
Mr. Qi.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.160
No problem.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.920
Inspector Tang Xuan.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.000
I hereby formally suspend you from your duties.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.120
You came prepared from the start.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.119
Guo Hua wasn't your target.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.279
It was me all along.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.679
You had inappropriate contact...

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.199
with Han Lie and Han Kui Long.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.199
You just said that before Ma Shan Bao was killed,

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.439
no information was leaked.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.519
Or let me put it this way.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.879
During the entire investigation,

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.879
when confidential information kept leaking,

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.319
you didn't execute any plan to explain this.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.960
You need to answer these questions.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.680
I suggest,

00:33:56.681 --> 00:33:57.800
can we do this?

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.720
Tang Xuan...

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.679
will take a leave of absence...

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.160
instead of being suspended.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.999
She can come back anytime to be interrogated by you.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.480
What you say to the public is up to you.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.520
Anyway, here's my request.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.959
During my interrogation,

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.200
you can't be involved in Ma Shan Bao's case anymore.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.880
Okay. I'll supervise it myself.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.360
That's all...

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.960
for today.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.920
Dad, you...

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.560
You're here.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.520
What's wrong? How did you get yourself into such a state?

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.599
Grandma asked me to stay at her place for a few days.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.600
Yes.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.879
I think...

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.719
it's not safe here lately.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.720
Why?

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.799
It's not safe here.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.400
Your car was stolen for no reason.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.600
I want Wei Wei to stay at my place for a few days.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Hey.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.880
You've been visiting him...

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.320
at school every few days.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.040
Now you want to take him away?

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.880
- Can't we discuss this calmly? - There's no need to discuss.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.119
- I'm worried about him. - No!

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.120
Stop arguing!

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.399
Grandma, go home first.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.400
I'll go and see you.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.519
No. Why don't you stay at my place for a few days?

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.079
Okay. I'll be there in a couple of days, okay?

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.640
Okay. Wei Wei.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.800
Wei Wei.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.280
Dad, what happened to you?

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.719
Are you alright? Why is there blood on the bathroom towel?

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.720
Are you scared?

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040
I...

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.040
Are you alright?

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.120
I'm fine.

00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:49.520
Why is there a man hiding here?

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.640
Call him Uncle.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.120
Kid.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.000
We have to pay for our mistakes.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.320
He's involved in the accident too?

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.120
Everything is related to the accident.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.400
Take him to the hospital now!

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.720
If we take him to the hospital,

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.240
the police will find out.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.440
Then what should we do?

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.680
What are you doing?

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.920
Calling your wife.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.320
Officer Hu.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.320
I'm sorry. I've caused you trouble.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.960
Who gave the inhaler to you?

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.440
I figured it out.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.920
There's only one person.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.200
Shi Zhi Yang, right?

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.920
I know it's because of Da Gama,

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.120
you have some opinions about Zhi Yang.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.120
But regarding the inhaler,

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.520
he just wants to help me find the real culprit.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.120
Therefore, it is entirely reasonable that his stance...

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.960
aligns with Han Kui Long's.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.320
What I think about him...

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.920
doesn't matter.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.600
Because I believe...

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.240
he wouldn't hurt his girlfriend.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.479
As for that lawyer, she's going to file a complaint against you.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.520
She wants you to be responsible for Ma Shan Bao's death.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.080
Actually, it's just an emotional appeal.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.200
The reason is insufficient.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.480
Because the information was leaked,

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.200
Ma Shan Bao died a wrongful death.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.240
This is a fact.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.720
It's normal for her...

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.520
to be angry with me.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.880
The leak...

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.600
is the most critical issue.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.680
Who exactly did this to you?

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.280
Why did they do this to you?

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.920
You must find the answers to these questions.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.879
Not for them.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.240
But for yourself.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.239
Anyway, you haven't taken a break for a long time.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.480
Just think of it as relaxing.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.999
Sometimes, I think...

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.560
if I can be an outsider,

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.360
I can see things clearer.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.399
- Madam. - What is it?

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.599
There was an explosion in the Old City District.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.720
Evidence shows it's related to the last firearms case.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.159
Hey, I'm the victim here.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.960
- Hey. - Why are you arresting me?

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.719
- You useless cop! - Hey!

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.919
You're the one who covered for Han Lie...

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.279
to start a war in the Old City District.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.479
You didn't arrest the murderer...

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.719
or the bomber.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.839
What kind of cop are you?

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.959
- You're just acting tough. - Keep talking...

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.320
and I'll sue you for defamation.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.880
Don't you dare harm me.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.880
The whole Old City District will come after you.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.960
Take him in.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.960
- Walk. - Come with me.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.960
Walk.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.999
Madam, you interrogate him later.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.880
She is on leave from now on.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.480
I'm in charge of this case.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.320
What is it, Officer Shi?

00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.559
You're indeed from the Intelligence Bureau.

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.800
You got the news so quickly.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.560
It's rare for you to be on leave.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.880
I should thank the Internal Investigations Unit.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.040
Can you take a day off?

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.079
I don't have a day off.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.479
But if you stay at home,

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.520
I'll feel more at ease.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.119
You should comfort me too.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.600
My case is complicated too.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.600
Things aren't going well with Liu Mao?

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.920
Yes.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.839
We found him,

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.519
but he's barely alive.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.960
I don't know if he'll make it.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.200
I can't ask him anything.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.080
Let's go.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.280
Let's get out of this sad place.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.520
You drive your car.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.880
I'll drive mine.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.880
See you at the usual spot.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.480
Wei.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.800
Wei.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.040
He has a high fever.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.240
Yes. We have to take him to the hospital.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.560
Tell the police...

00:40:05.561 --> 00:40:06.880
that the gun went off accidentally and he shot himself.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.519
It happens all the time in the Old City District.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.959
He's been unconscious for so long.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.640
Why are you only asking me to take him to the hospital now?

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.879
Does this have nothing to do with you?

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.880
It has nothing to do with my dad.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.879
It's my fault.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.680
You did this to him, didn't you?

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.640
Let's take him to the hospital first, all right?

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.960
Stay out of Wei's business.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.119
Honey, come on. Let's go.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.120
Let's go.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.560
I don't need your help!

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:32.640
Be careful.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.520
Be careful.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:39.720
Be careful.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.320
Okay.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.640
Okay.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.720
Thank you.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.000
Come as soon as you can.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:53.720
How is it, Dad?

00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:54.999
What did Mr. Peng say? Can he come?

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.400
He can only come tomorrow.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.960
He taught me...

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.920
to use alcohol to lower his fever.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.280
Let's wait until tomorrow then.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.880
Wei,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
hang in there.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.440
Mr. Peng will be here tomorrow.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.480
He'll remove the bullet, and you'll be fine.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.160
You'll be fine.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.560
You prepared so much food.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.560
It's just the two of us.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.880
Are you feeding the pigs?

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.320
Strictly speaking, you're the pig.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.320
I'm the little bok choy, here to feed you, little piggy.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.400
Why are you little bok choy?

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.880
Because pigs love bok choy.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.480
It's pig slop.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.160
That's right. Hey.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.160
My pig slop is very precious, Miss.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.120
I only give it to my dearest little piggy.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.080
Not just anyone can have it.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.040
Thank you.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.880
Forget it.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.640
I don't expect your soul to come back.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.520
But please,

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.600
give your body back to me.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.200
What for?

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.240
To wash the dishes.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.679
Whatever you want to do is fine with me.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.840
I'm sorry. I really can't tonight.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.960
Fine, I'll let you go.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:40.960
Anyway,

00:43:40.961 --> 00:43:43.240
you don't have to worry about the Internal Investigations.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.240
I'm sure your boss can handle it.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.000
But what I really want to tell you is,

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.279
sometimes walking in the gray area...

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.320
isn't a bad thing.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.400
It just depends on your intentions.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.600
Is it that hard to tell right from wrong?

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.279
Right now, people say you're bad,

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.080
but you say you're good.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.399
Who can judge that?

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.440
Get a judge to judge that?

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.280
A judge.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.120
Hello, Inspector Tang.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.400
It's Qin Yu.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.400
I'd like to talk to you again.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:17.879
Sure.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.279
I'm near your house now.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.480
Can we meet now?

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.720
Actually, all this time,

00:44:24.721 --> 00:44:26.079
we've always subjectively felt...

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.960
that judges are the fairest.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.600
Everything he said was true.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.960
But what if, from the very beginning,

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.119
everything he said was completely false...

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.480
and misleading?

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.679
Do you know what you're saying?

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.200
Yes, of course I do.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.680
What I mean is,

00:44:41.681 --> 00:44:42.719
if Judge Qin,

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.720
who is Qin Yu,

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.000
misled us from the start,

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.360
then all the doubts...

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.640
would be valid.

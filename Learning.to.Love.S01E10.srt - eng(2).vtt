00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:13.847
{\an8}Ms. Chihuahua!

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:26.726
{\an8}Come in.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.534
{\an8}As I said, I only have instant noodles.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.171
{\an8}That's fine.
I was actually craving instant noodles.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.508
{\an8}In that case, choose whichever you want!

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.045
{\an8}Wow, you bought so many!

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:48.014
{\an8}I don't often eat them
so I didn't know what to get.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.050
{\an8}I can help, I know a lot about them!

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.785
{\an8}Hang on, let me see…

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:55.021
{\an8}I would say… the best one is this one!

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:57.190
{\an8}The noodles and soup match perfectly

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:01.294
{\an8}and the package design is a classic,
so it's loved by everyone.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.997
{\an8}This one comes second!
It's quite spicy at first.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.466
{\an8}But then you start
to taste the subtle sweetness.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.269
{\an8}Makes you wonder,
"Is it spicy or is it sweet?"

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:10.904
{\an8}Kind of like me.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.405
{\an8}I see. Which one's next?

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:15.141
{\an8}The next one is the third best, right?

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.243
{\an8}The third place goes to this one!

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.814
{\an8}This one's an interesting one.
Kind of like a fan favorite.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.348
{\an8}- Which one do you want?
- I'll have…

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:24.184
{\an8}The second place!

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.554
{\an8}- I'll take the first place, and…
- And?

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.256
{\an8}The third place. Can I have two?

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:31.658
{\an8}Of course!

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:32.826
{\an8}Yay!

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.364
Oh, no!

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.999
- Are you okay?
- Sorry.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.007
All right, then!

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.311
Huh? Oh…

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:55.381
Thank you for the food.

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:59.452
{\an8}I haven't had noodles in a while.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.753
{\an8}SPICY MISO

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.530
Yum!

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:14.134
Miss, you need to really go all out!

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:19.139
Yeah.

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:23.076
No, you can do better!

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:26.779
Like this!

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.686
Wait…

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:40.894
Oh, yeah.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:46.399
I'll sneak out after I eat this.

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:47.534
Sneak out?

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.335
Your neighbors will gossip saying,

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:52.505
"The new tenant's already got
some handsome guy in her room."

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:56.075
I don't care what others think of me.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.613
I've lived my life
worrying about people's opinions

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.515
but I'm done being a good girl.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:06.586
I guess I'm too old to call myself a girl…

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:11.424
You've grown a lot.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.494
It's all thanks to you…

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:16.596
I guess.

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:18.565
Oh!

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:21.834
But still, I think I'll leave after this.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.405
I, um…

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.975
can't sleep well without my own pillow.

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:37.850
Until when can you stay at the dormitory?

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.120
My boss said until the end of September.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.192
- Hey…
- Oh?

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:51.898
Give me one minute.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.269
Hello? Ayaka?

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:57.570
Yeah, it's Kaoru!

00:03:58.538 --> 00:03:59.806
Really?

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.307
I mean, I'm flattered but…

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:05.445
I'll call you back, okay?

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.381
I love you!

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:09.449
Mwah!

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:17.090
- She's my customer.
- Yeah, I know. Your princess.

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:20.326
They're just being polite
by saying they'll treat me to dinner.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:24.063
- This one even said she'll marry me--
- How nice.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.203
- Are you perhaps…
- I'm not mad.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:31.771
Are you sure?

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:36.075
Are you going to continue being a host?

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:40.113
Yeah, I can't do anything else.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.954
When I was questioned,

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.924
I was the only one who took
so long to read the report.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.994
You taught me so much,

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:59.332
but when I saw those long sentences,
my head started to hurt.

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:03.569
Being a high-paid host
in such a glamorous world

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.939
made me think
that I was cool and successful.

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:09.776
But being outside the club…

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.578
I suddenly felt so lost.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:13.980
That can't be…

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.149
true.

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:19.886
It's okay. I'm used to it.

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.021
Well, I'm full now!

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:25.425
- Can I put these here?
- Yes.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.804
The owner of THE JOKER
was very worried about you.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.174
You're lucky you have someone
who cares about you.

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:43.910
And I'm sure you will find your way!

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.479
You met my boss?

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.582
He told me about your host name.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.785
I gave him the name Kaoru.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.821
Can I ask why you named him Kaoru?

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:59.992
I stank of sweat, so it's probably
"Kaoru" as in "Smell."

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.462
I wasn't showering regularly back then.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:03.796
I doubt that!

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:06.299
Kaoru means fragrant, not smelly.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:10.269
Especially the way your name
is written with the special "O."

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:13.973
It indicates that it means
something smells pleasant

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.809
or to have a subtle scent in old Japanese.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:18.378
So it has a nice meaning.

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:19.579
Huh…

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:22.248
Have you heard of The Tale of Genji?

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.485
There's a man called Kaoru in it.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:30.323
He was called that
because of his natural, pleasant scent.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.428
He was a diligent and prideful man,
who had many love affairs.

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:38.264
Kind of like you, don't you think?

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.541
You’ve had a tough few days.

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:13.866
You were awake?

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:16.402
Miss…

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:19.972
Can I keep pretending to be asleep?

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.475
But I already know you're pretending.

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:33.219
{\an8}It's okay.

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:36.622
{\an8}You don't need to treat me
like one of your customers.

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:41.093
{\an8}I had sworn to never love someone again.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.197
{\an8}But right now…

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:49.836
{\an8}I'm willing to get hurt again
as long as I can keep watching him sleep.

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:54.106
There's no escaping from love.

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:17.230
- Sorry, did I wake you?
- No.

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:23.870
You're leaving?

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.172
You have work, right?

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:28.341
I mean, I need to leave at some point…

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:31.878
Do you want to live here with me?

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:36.616
It'll be hard to find a place to live
without work, right?

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:41.587
You've become so forward all of a sudden.

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:44.924
It's not all of a sudden.
I thought about what you said last night.

00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:46.726
I thought hard.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:48.895
- But you were sleeping!
- Be serious.

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:49.929
Huh?

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:52.932
Do you not want to?

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:57.169
- Of course not!
- What?

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:58.905
I mean, think about it…

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:03.976
If the school finds out that you're living
with me, what will happen?

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:10.449
I don't want you to be criticized
because of me.

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:15.955
They might not approve of it, but…

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:17.890
I won't be breaking any laws.

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:21.894
You really are so naive!

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:27.934
When something is incomprehensible
to society, it just gets obliterated!

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.469
- Don't you get it?
- I will be honest and tell the school.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.873
- Tell them what?
- That I want to date you.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.675
I am not going to hide it.

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:38.244
They might not understand right away, but…

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:41.314
I'll do my best to make them understand.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.548
Have you lost it?

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:45.017
It's an all-girls school!

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:48.955
"I fell for a host
and now I want to move in with him!"

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.790
- Is that what you'll say?
- Yes.

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.658
- You're crazy!
- Yes, I am.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:54.060
Forget it!

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:11.844
I…

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:17.750
I'll look for a job
outside the host club industry.

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.560
Living together

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.463
will have to wait until then.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.739
Do you understand what I mean?

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:42.575
Yes.

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:46.178
It's so bright!

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:48.948
I don't usually go outside this early.

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:51.450
Were you always still asleep at this time?

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:53.653
No. I was going to bed at this time.

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:56.088
Wow! I bet you feel kind of jet-lagged.

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:57.390
I don't mind it.

00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:59.358
My days are longer now.

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:09.135
Boom! Oh, it's quite shaky!

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:11.671
What? Oh, yeah. You're right!

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.643
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:11.964
What? You want to date him?!

00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:14.667
That host guy? What do you mean?

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:18.938
- I want to be in a relationship with him.
- You can't be serious!

00:12:19.004 --> 00:12:21.173
You need to stop seeing him right now!

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:29.482
She could've dated him in secret
but she decided to tell us in advance.

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:32.017
But there's no way--

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.825
That must've taken a lot of courage
and determination.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:43.796
I thought it over and changed
my decision so many times…

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:46.999
In the end, your love for him won.

00:12:47.633 --> 00:12:48.667
Yes.

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:53.506
He also decided to quit being a host,
and find another job.

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:55.574
Oh, is that so?

00:12:56.909 --> 00:13:01.580
Perhaps you helped this young man
find his way in life.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:09.021
However, we did make a promise
with our students' parents.

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:12.358
"As a teacher and a mentor to minors,
I will never again be involved

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:18.197
with people who work at host clubs
which are deemed evil under social norms."

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:19.665
Ms. Ogawa.

00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:25.971
Keeping promises is the most
important thing for those who serve God.

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:34.180
Please vacate the premises.

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:41.554
As in, I have to resign?

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:44.190
Since it's still summer vacation,

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:48.394
Mr. Sakura can take over your role
from the start of next term.

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:51.263
In order not to upset the students,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.835
we'll tell them you had to resign
due to family circumstances.

00:13:55.901 --> 00:14:00.005
Oh, but I feel like that's a bit harsh…

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:05.311
I want our students to be taught
by a teacher who puts them first.

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:08.914
I wish you all the best.

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:12.785
Vice Principal!

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:25.297
Thank you for visiting our store!
Right now, we are…

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:27.233
The writing is tiny!

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:33.105
{\an8}"Work in a new environment."

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.574
{\an8}QUALIFICATIONS

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:36.775
{\an8}College graduates only?

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:41.247
{\an8}Experience in customer service! Yes!

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:42.281
{\an8}HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:43.983
Oh, high school graduates only…

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:47.286
I don't have a driver's license.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.722
{\an8}GIVE US A CALL, AND BRING YOUR CV IN!

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:57.930
OLD HAG

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:03.202
He's not picking up.

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:05.037
Yuki!

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.006
Yes!

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:11.610
Okay. Let's do this. Good!

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:13.045
Try texting him.

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:16.382
He can't text very well.

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:18.617
His club closed down
and he's jobless, right?

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:21.420
Go get the three million yen
before he uses it all!

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:24.189
Don't talk about money in front of Yuki!

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:31.830
Did Taiga lose his job?

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:34.033
He's fine!

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.136
- Let's make you look cute!
- Yeah!

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:40.072
THE LION AND THE MOUSE

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:41.974
I need to wet your hair. Ready?

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:45.277
- It's cold!
- Is it? Okay, once more!

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.179
All right.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.914
Now, then…

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:51.450
Wow, it's grown a lot!

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:54.753
{\an8}REGARDING THE COMPLIANCE
MANAGER'S RESIGNATION

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.588
{\an8}Oh dear…

00:15:56.655 --> 00:15:57.690
{\an8}RESIGNING: SEIJI OGAWA

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:02.394
- Yoji.
- Oh, hello.

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:06.165
The CEO asked me
to be an advisor to the subsidiary.

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:09.001
I guessed this would happen.

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:11.437
This way, please.

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:14.106
You must be relieved, though.

00:16:14.773 --> 00:16:18.010
Punishment for harassment cases
are very severe lately.

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:20.279
But they gave you another position.

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:21.780
They must trust you.

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:24.984
Don't try to console me.
I haven't given up yet.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:25.918
What?

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:30.789
I will get those who set me up
and get back to headquarters.

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:34.660
I'll play dirty if I have to.
Nothing will stop me.

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:37.329
You should also not give up on Manami.

00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:41.667
But, sir…

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:45.771
I think there are times
when we need to give up.

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:49.742
I told the host, Kaoru…

00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:54.513
Manami's new address.

00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:57.349
- What?
- Uh, well…

00:16:57.416 --> 00:17:00.619
I guess I kind of acted as a mediator.

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:04.189
They made me want to help them!

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:07.159
- Have you gone mad?
- No.

00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:10.863
I've never felt this calm, actually.

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:17.436
Losing Manami made me realize
why she fell for him.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.338
Why is it?

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:23.275
I think you were one of the reasons.

00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:25.544
What are you implying I did?

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:30.182
Perhaps you suffocated her with your love.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.886
You had too many expectations of her.

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:36.288
And helped her before she even failed.

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:40.125
Of course, it was Manami's decision
to follow the paths you chose for her.

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:42.061
It was all she could do. However…

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:46.331
I think she probably felt
constricted all her life.

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:48.367
What gave you that idea?

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:51.070
Meeting Kaoru made me realize it.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.140
Sure, he's a host
and from a social perspective,

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:58.110
he's perceived as scum
and a good-for-nothing.

00:17:58.177 --> 00:18:00.479
But he lives freely.

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:04.216
I don't mean to say he's pure-hearted.

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:11.023
But I do think he's the type of person
who can overcome any obstacles.

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:14.993
Manami needs someone like him!

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.462
How irresponsible!

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:20.532
Her life could fall apart
because of that scum!

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:23.068
I believe Manami can crawl back up!

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:26.238
And for your information,
I am also pretty scummy!

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.508
Goodbye!

00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:49.595
Do you understand the meaning?

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.372
STUDENT FILE

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.190
Ms. Morimura, what do you think?

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:26.031
Ms. Ichikawa, tell me what you think.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:31.270
Ms. Tamura?

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:37.075
This isn't the time to study English.

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:38.710
I said give it back!

00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:40.679
What's going on?

00:19:49.655 --> 00:19:52.891
- Throw it up high and…
- Welcome! Oops!

00:19:57.462 --> 00:19:58.697
Here you go.

00:20:20.118 --> 00:20:22.387
The vice principal told me.

00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:26.291
Thank you for taking over the role
of homeroom teacher next term.

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:28.193
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:30.762
I'll be fine.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.633
Since I watched over this class
with you as your assistant.

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:38.637
This…

00:20:42.307 --> 00:20:43.709
might come in handy.

00:20:49.982 --> 00:20:53.218
HARUNA NAKAMURA

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:54.620
SELF-DRIVEN, LITTLE SUPPORT NEEDED

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:55.954
There's so much information…

00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:58.824
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO STUDY ABROAD

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:02.261
You worked hard putting together
all this information.

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:08.533
Will you not say goodbye to the students?

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:13.171
Unfortunately, the vice principal wants me

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:15.807
to leave without telling them
what happened.

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:20.479
I don't want to cause any distractions
for my students, either.

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.283
I understand.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:29.354
I'm still surprised myself, to be honest!

00:21:33.258 --> 00:21:35.927
Your words helped me make this decision.

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:40.132
We don't fall for someone
in order to be happy.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.737
I can ask the vice principal
to at least give you the chance

00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:47.506
to say goodbye to the students.

00:21:48.106 --> 00:21:49.708
Thank you.

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:54.413
But even if I did have
the chance to say goodbye,

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:56.415
I can't tell them the truth.

00:21:57.149 --> 00:22:00.719
If I have to lie to them,
I'd rather not say anything.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:16.468
- Welcome!
- Can I have an iced coffee, please?

00:22:16.535 --> 00:22:17.502
Right away.

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:20.072
Hey!

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:23.775
Why did you want to see me
all of a sudden?

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:27.012
- Are you going to university?
- Yes.

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:30.015
I was planning to take
a gap year and save up,

00:22:30.082 --> 00:22:31.750
but decided to start job hunting.

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:35.087
Wow, you got over it quickly!

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:39.524
Being a host was only ever
temporary for me.

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:45.197
But there are moments
when I miss being a host so much.

00:22:45.263 --> 00:22:47.165
I know what you mean.

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:51.036
Being in that club
helped me escape from reality.

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:51.937
Yeah.

00:22:52.003 --> 00:22:58.009
And making customers happy,
gave me delusions about my self-worth.

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:02.714
Thank you for waiting,
here's you're iced coffee.

00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:09.087
Hey, do you…

00:23:10.188 --> 00:23:12.157
have a girlfriend?

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:13.592
No way.

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:17.396
I knew having a girlfriend would
be a hindrance for a host.

00:23:17.462 --> 00:23:18.797
True.

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:22.434
I doubt I can have a normal dating life.

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:24.936
I can't look at women the way others do.

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:30.242
Oh, could it be
that you're in love with someone?

00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:40.485
She said she wants to…

00:23:41.953 --> 00:23:42.821
live together.

00:23:43.688 --> 00:23:45.056
Huh…

00:23:45.123 --> 00:23:47.626
But honestly, I don't know what to do.

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:55.066
Because being a host is like,
playing a role as an actor, right?

00:23:56.101 --> 00:24:00.071
Roles in a play where you're called
Tsubasa and I'm called Kaoru.

00:24:01.706 --> 00:24:05.544
Which was why I had no issue
with saying stuff like "I love you."

00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:09.581
I was even putting my arm around them
and didn't feel shy at all.

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:13.185
I feel like I've said "I love you"
enough for a lifetime.

00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:14.286
Yeah.

00:24:15.887 --> 00:24:19.524
But in reality, I can't do anything.

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:26.965
Do you think it's okay for people like us
to truly fall for someone?

00:24:31.937 --> 00:24:33.305
I wish I could say…

00:24:34.773 --> 00:24:36.842
"I love you!"

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:39.411
Just like that, but…

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:43.982
I feel like it sounds tainted
and I can't say it.

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:49.754
If it's troubling you that much,
your feelings must be real.

00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:54.659
I'm so envious!

00:24:54.726 --> 00:24:57.395
- Such pure love!
- Hey, stop it!

00:24:57.462 --> 00:24:59.831
What's with you? Sorry.

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:09.074
- Excuse me, is that for Ogawa in room 510?
- Yes.

00:25:10.375 --> 00:25:12.010
- Apologies.
- No problem.

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:15.313
If you could sign here, please.

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:36.801
Hello?

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:38.970
How's your new place?

00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:42.140
Uh, yeah. I'm not used to it yet.

00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:45.076
Do you want me to bring you food?

00:25:45.143 --> 00:25:47.612
No, don't worry! I'm doing fine.

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:48.713
But actually…

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:51.917
I have something to tell you.

00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:54.753
- What is it?
- It's about the school.

00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:57.088
I had to resign.

00:25:58.056 --> 00:25:58.990
What?

00:26:00.091 --> 00:26:01.326
Uh, what? Hello?

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:04.729
I told them I wanted
to start dating Mr. Takamori.

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:06.231
And they asked me to quit.

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:07.766
Takamori? You mean…

00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:09.868
That host called "Kaoru"?

00:26:09.935 --> 00:26:11.536
His name's Taiga Takamori.

00:26:12.103 --> 00:26:14.005
A serious relationship? Really?

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:16.741
Yeah.

00:26:16.808 --> 00:26:17.976
What?

00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:22.747
So, what are you going to do from now on?

00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:25.450
Don't worry, I'll find a job
somewhere by myself.

00:26:27.852 --> 00:26:31.489
But can you really see a future with him?

00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:34.292
I don't want to say this, but…

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:37.696
I can only see you being dumped
and this ending in tears.

00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:40.332
I think most people would think so.

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:42.233
But…

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:48.440
Any relationship could fall apart, right?

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:51.843
I don't know why…

00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:57.315
but I don't feel scared.

00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:01.720
I was so scared
of falling for someone before.

00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:08.093
I'm sorry to make you worry.
I'll come talk to you once I settle down.

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:09.861
Okay.

00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:14.132
In that case,
I won't tell your dad about Mr. Takamori.

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:17.002
Or about your resignation yet. Okay?

00:27:19.871 --> 00:27:23.041
All right! Talk to you soon!

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:25.410
Welcome back!

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:25.370
RESUME

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:48.660
TAIGA TAKAMORI

00:28:49.627 --> 00:28:51.463
It looks so messy.

00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:05.643
{\an8}This should help.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:06.544
{\an8}ASSIGNMENT

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:13.618
TAIGA TAKAMORI
TAKA / GA

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:16.121
Right. I got this!

00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:33.204
- Hiya!
- Oh, it's you.

00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:35.740
I came to see you
because I was worried about you!

00:29:36.908 --> 00:29:40.245
- Did you get a new job?
- Not yet.

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:42.814
Well… I guess there's no rush.

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:45.016
You must have a lot saved up.

00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:46.951
I have no money to give you.

00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:51.422
I decided to quit being a host.

00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:52.323
What?

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.759
But you'll be wasting your talent!

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:57.896
Any club would hire you with your looks.

00:29:57.962 --> 00:30:00.165
I thought you hated hosts.

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:02.300
That's true.

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:07.038
But for you, I doubt there are
any other jobs out there.

00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:11.843
It doesn't matter.
I won't give you a penny.

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.847
Leave him if he gets mad at you for this!

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:19.517
Don't be mean to me, Taiga!

00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:22.620
I want to help him get back on his feet!

00:30:23.588 --> 00:30:25.356
Yuki needs his dad around, too.

00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:29.194
He's such a lousy dad!
Yuki will be totally fine without him.

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:34.799
I didn't have my dad around
but I grew up nice and tall, didn't I?

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:38.303
Oh, I almost forgot! Have a look at this!

00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:40.205
I cut Yuki's hair today.

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:42.874
How cute is he?

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:46.311
Remember I used to cut your hair?

00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:50.048
I've more than paid you back for that.

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:55.954
Since you're here,
there's something I want to ask you.

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:03.962
Who is my dad?

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.832
Why the sudden interest?

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:10.501
I figured it was
a good opportunity to ask.

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:12.337
Why do you care about it now?

00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:15.273
Fine…

00:31:15.807 --> 00:31:17.709
I thought I'd ask.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.578
Since it's my last chance.

00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:22.580
Last chance?

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:25.717
We will never meet again.

00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:28.953
- What?
- I want to change.

00:31:30.321 --> 00:31:33.758
So don't ever contact me, okay?

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:36.895
I'm going to block your phone number, too.

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:38.796
What on earth are you saying?

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:41.065
I am your mother!

00:31:41.132 --> 00:31:42.867
Is that so?

00:31:43.701 --> 00:31:47.272
Oh, really?
That's the way you want to be, huh?

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:49.908
Fine, then!

00:31:50.541 --> 00:31:53.811
I will never contact you again!

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:55.647
Yeah, that would be great.

00:31:58.583 --> 00:31:59.984
Take care of Yuki, okay?

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:11.095
You have no idea how I feel.

00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:13.865
Screw you!

00:32:20.204 --> 00:32:22.774
All right, then. Ready?

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.275
It's cold!

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:25.944
Keep your eyes closed.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:26.945
Okay.

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:30.581
Look at me. You look so cute!

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:39.490
ASSIGNMENT

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:44.729
I got you a moving gift.

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:47.298
- Oh, thank you!
- Congratulations.

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:52.203
- These are so pretty!
- I wasn't sure what to get you.

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.839
I thought you could use them with Kaoru.

00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:58.276
Thank you. I'll take good care of them.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:02.113
Taking care of it
doesn't mean it will never break.

00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:06.117
You know, it's made of glass.

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:11.022
If you hit it somewhere, it cracks easily.

00:33:11.589 --> 00:33:13.324
If you drop it, it'll shatter.

00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:18.096
But if you lock it away
so you won't break it,

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.032
it becomes opaque and dirty.

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:27.872
To be honest, I have doubts about him
being able to live a normal life.

00:33:28.873 --> 00:33:33.678
If I were you,
I'd hide my feelings and push him away.

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:38.649
But you can't do that because you are you!

00:33:41.085 --> 00:33:44.655
I don't think I'll cry
no matter what happens this time.

00:33:44.722 --> 00:33:45.957
Are you sure?

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:48.860
What if he's seeing
one of his "princesses" right now?

00:33:48.926 --> 00:33:50.161
What?

00:33:58.903 --> 00:34:01.205
Miss! I bought some snacks for us!

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:09.213
- Hey! Can I come in?
- Of course.

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:12.383
- Let's eat these together!
- Yes!

00:34:13.418 --> 00:34:15.119
- Hey!
- Oh, hey.

00:34:18.122 --> 00:34:21.659
I don't want to be a third wheel
so I'll go now, but just one thing…

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.263
- That's kind of scary--
- Good! I want you to be scared!

00:34:27.298 --> 00:34:29.667
Don't you dare date Manami half-heartedly.

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:30.701
I won't allow it.

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:35.807
Make her cry, and I'll kill you.

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:38.376
Understood?

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:42.780
Thank you for having me!

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:56.527
She was so cute.

00:34:58.563 --> 00:35:00.698
She even said she wanted to marry me.

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:06.871
She was very cute and clever.

00:35:08.906 --> 00:35:10.842
She really was your pride and joy.

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:12.877
So why…

00:35:14.712 --> 00:35:17.615
Why is she treating me this way?

00:35:19.684 --> 00:35:21.185
She just grew up, that's all.

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:23.354
I worked so hard all my life.

00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:25.623
Why?

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:29.727
Why do people look down on me
and trample on my feelings?

00:35:30.928 --> 00:35:31.929
Darling…

00:35:32.563 --> 00:35:34.699
Please pull yourself together.

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:39.670
No one is trying
to trample on your feelings.

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:51.816
Move.

00:35:52.483 --> 00:35:53.351
What?

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:02.460
This is not Manami's, is it?

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:04.762
I have no idea.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.999
The only person who'd wear this…

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:11.169
would be that host!

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:18.442
Hey, stop it!

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.514
I can't do this anymore!

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:29.654
Manami and I do not belong to you!

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:38.496
Um…

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:43.534
I have a job interview at a restaurant.

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:48.940
- A restaurant?
- Yeah, they're looking for a waiter.

00:36:49.006 --> 00:36:50.708
No need for a high school diploma.

00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:55.313
But I need a CV…

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.582
Let's write one together.

00:37:00.184 --> 00:37:02.353
I've resigned from my job.

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:06.490
What? Why? Because of me?

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.659
You're not the reason.

00:37:08.726 --> 00:37:11.495
It's my fault.
I just wasn't trustworthy enough.

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:19.337
I feel bad for my students,
but I'll find another school to teach at.

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:20.471
I told you!

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:23.708
There was no need for you
to tell them everything!

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:25.243
I didn't want to hide it.

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:27.211
You're being so dumb!

00:37:27.878 --> 00:37:31.315
Teaching isn't something
that just anyone can do!

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:35.653
- Why do you have to make your life hard?
- I didn't want to lie.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.588
Everyone lies, everyday.

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:40.291
You think you can live life without lying?

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:43.594
That's why, at least
I didn't want to lie about us.

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:45.096
You're so frustrating!

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.467
- It's a lot to handle!
- You don't have to tell me that!

00:37:50.501 --> 00:37:52.169
Huh? What happened?

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:55.973
It must be the breaker.

00:37:56.874 --> 00:37:57.908
Okay.

00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:01.412
I found it! You need to remember this.

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:04.515
Rich people like you
wouldn't know about it,

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:07.351
but the breaker in places like this
can get overloaded.

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:10.021
It'll reset if you push
the one on the left up.

00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:12.590
- That's the one.
- I can't reach.

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:17.361
All right.

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:19.330
- Ready?
- What?

00:38:19.397 --> 00:38:20.331
Go!

00:38:21.032 --> 00:38:23.000
- Yay, it's on!
- Hey, careful!

00:38:25.903 --> 00:38:27.838
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

00:38:33.377 --> 00:38:37.014
You're heavier than I thought.

00:38:38.015 --> 00:38:40.084
I'm a lot to handle after all.

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:49.527
I…

00:38:54.432 --> 00:38:55.866
I want to be with you.

00:38:57.134 --> 00:38:58.602
That's all I want.

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:03.574
I…

00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:10.381
- What's wrong?
- Well…

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.018
Miss…

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:16.787
Can you read me a book?

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:20.257
- A book?
- Yeah, a book.

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:27.765
- I don't have anything I can read you.
- There must be something!

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:36.140
- Oh, look. How about this?
- What?

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:43.881
"A gathering of delicious
northern seafoods!"

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:47.451
{\an8}"Sea urchin and salmon roe rice bowl!"

00:39:47.518 --> 00:39:51.555
- This is how you write sea urchin?
- Yes. Now it's your turn!

00:39:56.293 --> 00:40:01.932
"There are crabs
for the first 100 customers."

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:04.468
"From Hokkaido."

00:40:05.035 --> 00:40:07.538
- "Shipped directly."
- Directly! Good!

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:09.273
"Premium…"

00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:12.343
- Selection.
- Selection?

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.911
- "Snow crab!"
- That's right!

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:15.513
- "Selection of snow crabs."
- Yes!

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:18.482
"It'll be such a feast!"

00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:19.984
Well done!

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:25.623
Before I met you
I avoided reading any letters.

00:40:25.689 --> 00:40:29.260
But now whenever I see them,
I try to pay attention to them.

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:32.329
I still can't write well though.

00:40:33.664 --> 00:40:35.166
Oh, I know!

00:41:02.326 --> 00:41:04.061
I ALSO

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:15.673
I ALSO WANT TO BE WITH YOU

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:29.253
THANK YOU

00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:37.962
SHALL WE HAVE SOME WINE?

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:44.802
YES, LET'S DRINK!

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:49.907
COOL, CHEERS!

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:53.077
You've gotten so good at writing this one!

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:55.412
Stop making me blush.
Come on, next sentence!

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:57.348
CHEERS!

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:58.849
Cheers!

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:45.629
Who could it be? It's so late.

00:42:52.436 --> 00:42:53.270
What's wrong?

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:57.474
- Dad, what are you--
- Sorry for showing up unannounced.

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:00.277
Hello.

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:03.147
You're Kaoru, huh?

00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:05.683
My name's Takamori.

00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:07.618
- Nice to meet you.
- No need for that!

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:09.920
- You need to leave right now!
- What?

00:43:09.987 --> 00:43:13.090
- My family's fallen apart because of you!
- Stop!

00:43:13.691 --> 00:43:18.429
I didn't raise you just so you could
spend your life with a host!

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:24.535
Have you ever thought
about her parents' feelings?

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.840
I doubt you have the ability to do that.

00:43:32.676 --> 00:43:34.878
You wouldn't be a host otherwise!

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:35.946
That's enough!

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:40.284
I heard you didn't even go to high school,
but that's not an excuse!

00:43:40.884 --> 00:43:45.289
Even without a proper education,
there are many people with decent jobs.

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:48.826
But you took the easy way out
and gave up on such a life!

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:51.462
- Stop it, please!
- Don't defend this scum!

00:43:51.528 --> 00:43:53.998
Manami, I told you,
you're too vulnerable--

00:43:55.232 --> 00:43:56.266
Move.

00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:59.670
Don't touch my daughter
with your filthy hands!

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.477
That's it. Stay down there!

00:44:07.244 --> 00:44:08.979
You do not belong in our world!

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:22.292
So you do have some self-control.

00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:24.695
You were testing him?

00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:27.398
Retire from the entertainment business.

00:44:28.365 --> 00:44:32.770
There must be vocational schools
that would accept you!

00:44:33.604 --> 00:44:37.174
Get into one, and find a secure job
that's stable for life!

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:41.178
- School…?
- Educational background isn't everything!

00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:44.048
But I need you to show me
that you can push yourself!

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:47.985
It's a way for you
to take responsibility as a man!

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:09.573
Miss…

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:12.643
why are you crying?

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:18.348
You haven't…

00:45:21.719 --> 00:45:23.387
given up on me, have you?

00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:29.693
I'll show him.

00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:39.837
{\an8}I'll show him.

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:44.808
Ms. Chihuahua,
I'm glad I couldn't write kanji.

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:48.078
Because if I were able to write kanji,

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:50.347
we wouldn’t have ended up together, right?

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:55.953
{\an8}THE REVISED ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS ACT LAW
WAS ENACTED ON JUNE 28, 2025

Madam, No Mercy for Scum]

[Episode 16]

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.280
Sorry. The subscriber you dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.940
Zhizhi,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.940
where are you?

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.980
Why didn't you answer your phone?

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.780
I'm at home.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.100
My phone died,
that's why I missed your call.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.620
Wait for me at home.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.420
Zhizhi,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.740
are you okay?

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.020
Why would anything be wrong?

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.820
I was about to ask you.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.660
Weren't we supposed to
have dinner together tonight?

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.420
Why didn't you show up?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.980
Why were you having dinner with my dad?

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.220
Your dad came to see me at the office.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.980
He asked me to have dinner
and said that you would be there.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.500
Zhizhi,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.900
if my dad comes to you again,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.060
you have to tell me immediately.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.740
But your dad is quite intimidating.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.780
I'm getting older.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.100
I don't know what you young ladies

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.700
like to eat these days.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.340
So I just ordered a few things.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.860
Well, does it suit your taste?

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.860
Sir,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.100
I'm fine with anything.
I'm not a picky eater.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.140
Zhizhi,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.100
I've discussed your marriage

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.740
to Baijian with your father.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.460
We both think

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.180
it's time to move things forward.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.300
We will

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.900
follow whatever you elders decide.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.660
Good.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.660
If you want to become
part of the Ji family,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.740
you must abide by the Ji family rules.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.620
I can be self-centered.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.340
As the head of this family,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.220
I'm rather blunt.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.740
I hope

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.420
you won't mind.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.340
Baijian.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.260
When you go back, please ask your dad

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.900
what his impression of me was.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.700
I feel like

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.500
I wasn't quite at my best today.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.900
Okay.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.820
Since you're alright, I'll leave.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.980
Get some rest.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.140
Why are you so flustered today?

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.180
I have other things to do.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.940
Why did you go see Song Zhizhi?

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.180
You know what I'll do if you disobey me.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.540
It's a puppy.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.180
Dad, where's Ye?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.100
You actually disobeyed me!

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.940
Dad, I'll listen to you from now on.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.900
Please, give Ye back to me.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.980
I'll always obey you.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.860
Please, give Ye back to me.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.620
All these years,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.540
my father has been living

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.900
in the shadow of losing my mother.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.940
Knowing him,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.100
he will seek revenge.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.660
He will make sure Song Shan

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.620
feels the pain of losing his career

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.860
and his family too.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.860
I can't change him.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.740
You're planning to propose to Zhizhi?

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.980
Marrying her

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.380
will allow you to protect her better.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.700
At least, if I marry her,

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.300
she'll be my dad's daughter-in-law.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.500
The decades-old feud between my dad
and the Song family

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.140
will at least not involve her anymore.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.940
It's the best protection I can give her.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.740
Ji,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.300
think this through.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.060
Once you make this move,

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.540
there's no going back.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.220
And Song Zhizhi

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.780
may never understand your reasons.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.060
How lively.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.940
Why did you suddenly ask me out?
Is something wrong?

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.820
Zhizhi,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.620
about starting the new company,

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.420
what did your dad say?

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.540
He still doesn't agree.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.380
After all, Starlight Jewelry

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.220
is his life's work.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.940
Transferring the core team

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.660
to start a new company

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.900
is hard for him to accept.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.740
And Ziming also feels

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.420
it might not be the right approach.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.300
Let's get married.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.740
What did you say?

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.580
I said, let's get married.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.420
We're already engaged.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.340
And a marriage alliance

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.580
would solve your family's problems.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.500
It's the logical next step.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.820
A marriage alliance?

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.140
You're saying our marriage
would be a business arrangement?

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.580
No, I mean,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.220
you're having a funding problem now.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:19.980
Our marriage

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.420
would justify my diverting funds

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.980
from Jihong Group.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.620
If marriage is meant to help my family,

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.380
then forget it.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.060
If you still see this

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.780
as just a business arrangement,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.180
I appreciate the offer.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.340
But I don't need it.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.660
Why are you getting so upset
all of a sudden?

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.580
Let go of me.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.780
Zhizhi.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.460
What's wrong?

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.860
Something's bothering you?

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:31.860
No, nothing.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.180
Ziming,

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.980
I want to ask you a question.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.660
What do you think

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.620
the best relationship

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.060
between two people is?

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.740
I think

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.900
it must be

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.300
mutual love,

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.860
help,

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.780
and support.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.500
Ji Baijian proposed to me.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.060
Did you say yes?

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.260
I thought

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.860
what I had with him

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.860
was exactly the kind of relationship
you described.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.060
But today he called it
a marriage alliance.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.740
It upset me.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.460
Then...

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.220

if you're not sure about something,

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.740
I'm here to help you figure it out.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:22.540
Hello?

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:25.580
Where are you?

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.340
Mr. Wei, you're here.

I'll leave you two alone.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.060
Have a seat. Let's talk over a drink.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.020
Ji Baijian,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.500
I heard you proposed to Song Zhizhi.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:03.780
Yes, I did.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:06.660
Alright.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.860
Was it for business reasons,

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.140
or do you actually love her?

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.660
Is that any of your business?

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.580
Of course it is!

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.300
Ji Baijian,

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.700
I just want to hear you say it yourself.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.940

Mr. Song,

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.340
as Zhizhi mentioned last time,

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.340
we could establish a new joint venture

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:09.820
and move the Quefeng project

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.060
to this new company,

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.180
where Jihong Group will

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.060
inject capital.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.780
This will provide
sufficient financial support

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.580
to address Starlight Jewelry's inability

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.940
to run the project

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.220
due to a broken capital chain.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.860
Mr. Song, what do you think?

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.220
Mr. Song.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.300
There's a document here
requiring your signature.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.020
I'll get back to work then.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.060
Mr. Song,

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.700
I also suggest you

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.460
gradually transfer the core team
to the new company.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.180
Ye Taiting wants Starlight Jewelry,
doesn't he?

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.340
Let's just give him the empty shell.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.300
Baijian,

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.140
your father

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.980
has always valued
relationships and loyalty.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.860
I appreciate the thoughtfulness
from you and your father.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.260
But Zhizhi must have told you

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.020
about my concerns.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.060
Mr. Song, I understand.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.020
You built Starlight Jewelry

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:16.860
with painstaking effort.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.780
You've always treated it
like your own child.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.100
Giving it up would be like

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:22.500
losing a part of yourself.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.140
And I guess

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.100
you've also considered the shares
for the new company.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:28.900
The Ji family's involvement

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.540
would inevitably dilute
the Song family's control.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.300
You're worried
about ending up with nothing.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.420
Don't worry about that.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.700
I've formally proposed to Zhizhi.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.420
And she has said yes.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.180
After we are married,

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.900
the company will be registered
under both our names.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.980
It'll be our marital property.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:52.540
This new company

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.300
will be entirely
under Zhizhi's management.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.700
She is more talented than I am

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:56.940
in jewelry design.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.540
I'll fully support her

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.300
and be her strongest backup.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.180
Baijian,

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.780
since you're being so sincere,

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.740
we'll go ahead with your plan.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.420
I trust your character,

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.820
and I trust Zhizhi's choice.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.540
Then I'm entrusting my precious girl

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.380
to you.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:28.700
You must treat her well.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.220
Don't let her down.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.340
You should move forward
with the wedding plans

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.980
and the establishment
of the new company.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.660
Dad, don't worry.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.220
Baijian and I won't let you down.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.780
Found it!

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:02.580
Zhizhi,

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.420
look at you, always so rushed
and careless.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.700
I need to give you
a few words of advice.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.980
You're about to get married.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.980
You need to stop acting so spoiled.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.060
Dad,

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.620
what are you talking about?

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.180
I'm not that willful.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.140
You've got me wrong.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.260
I know

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.380
my own daughter very well.

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.180
Dad, look.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.700
I remember this photo

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.180
was from when we went on
that trip together,

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.220
and Zhiyan fell into the fountain.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.260
Yes.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.420
In the blink of an eye,
you've all grown so big.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.380
This one.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.140
This must be
from my fifth birthday, right?

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.180
Is this Baijian?

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:47.660
No.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.620
This is Ye Shengheng, the son

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.740
of Ye Taiting's big brother.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.260
Such a pity. There was a car accident.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.620
And his whole family was gone.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.020
Baijian?

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.620
He didn't come that day.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.100
I think he was sick.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.420
I specifically had someone

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:05.540
deliver the gift to him.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.460
But when Baijian proposed,

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.580
he said our first meeting

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.380
was at my fifth birthday party.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.140

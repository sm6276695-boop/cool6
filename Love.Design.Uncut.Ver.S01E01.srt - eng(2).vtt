[JINTA Architect]

00:01:40.095 --> 00:01:41.669
Hey, let me join.

00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:04.675
I'm not fixing it.

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:05.949
You have to fix it, Chan.

00:02:05.974 --> 00:02:06.942
But I'm not going to.

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:08.160
Chan, you have to.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:09.008
This is your project.

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:10.886
Chan, listen to me.

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:12.970
Why are you being so unreasonable?

00:02:12.994 --> 00:02:14.510
You're being self-centered again.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.965
Revising a design for Feng Shui?

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.158
Who is this master anyway?

00:02:17.182 --> 00:02:18.259
What right does he have to ruin my work?

00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:19.764
What about my aesthetics?

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.825
You know the client believes in Feng Shui.

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:23.918
I know.

00:02:24.032 --> 00:02:25.542
But I'm not fixing it.

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:26.702
You have to fix it.

00:02:26.727 --> 00:02:27.303
I won't.

00:02:27.327 --> 00:02:28.635
Are you two going to argue much longer?

00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:32.320
Aokbab.

00:03:53.292 --> 00:03:55.041
So, let me get this straight.

00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:56.847
The client already okayed the design...

00:03:56.872 --> 00:03:59.417
but a Feng Shui master said it had bad energy.

00:03:59.442 --> 00:04:01.561
So now the client wants to change the interior design...

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:02.857
based on his advice.

00:04:02.882 --> 00:04:04.390
But Chan refuses to fix it...

00:04:04.414 --> 00:04:06.054
because it ruins the look. Correct?

00:04:07.143 --> 00:04:07.949
Yes.

00:04:08.104 --> 00:04:09.918
That damn Feng Shui master is ruining my work.

00:04:10.128 --> 00:04:12.016
But if you don't fix it, it won't get approved.

00:04:12.308 --> 00:04:13.758
The deadline is getting close.

00:04:13.782 --> 00:04:15.424
I wouldn't call this a revision.

00:04:15.527 --> 00:04:16.762
This is a complete do-over.

00:04:16.787 --> 00:04:18.715
There's no way I can make your deadline.

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.249
We're in the same boat here.

00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:20.905
You...

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:22.658
Can you two stop biting each other's heads off?

00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:23.838
I can't think.

00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:38.007
Chan.

00:04:38.031 --> 00:04:40.142
Try changing the living room's color scheme.

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:41.373
Is that hard?

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:43.772
It's not hard, but I think...

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:45.059
Just do it.

00:04:46.474 --> 00:04:47.752
Why don't you give it a try?

00:04:47.777 --> 00:04:50.297
Didn't the client say they want to enhance the water element?

00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:53.234
Try changing the living room's color scheme to light or dark blue.

00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:57.615
- Ugh, that's not...
- Chan.

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.253
Alright, I'll show you.

00:05:14.543 --> 00:05:15.982
There, something like this.

00:05:30.972 --> 00:05:33.232
Can I see the garden area?

00:05:45.385 --> 00:05:47.397
Can we try moving these trees?

00:05:47.421 --> 00:05:48.902
And putting a fountain here instead?

00:05:49.488 --> 00:05:51.330
- We could, but I think it's...
- Don't argue.

00:05:51.354 --> 00:05:52.705
And add 9 koi fish.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.443
- Does it have to be 9?
- Yup.

00:06:05.493 --> 00:06:07.753
Okay, send it like this.

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:10.442
Show the client a rough draft.

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.051
Tell them we've made the enhancements.

00:06:12.076 --> 00:06:14.178
The living room is now a blue tone...

00:06:14.202 --> 00:06:15.371
to boost the water element.

00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:17.693
The pond in the north also adds to the water element.

00:06:17.723 --> 00:06:19.887
Plus, we've included 9 auspicious koi fish.

00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:21.214
Do you think they'll be okay with this?

00:06:21.238 --> 00:06:22.407
If they are...

00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:23.869
we can work on the details.

00:06:23.894 --> 00:06:25.049
Ask for an extension.

00:06:25.073 --> 00:06:27.642
That way, Chan can't complain about the deadline.

00:06:27.877 --> 00:06:30.403
And Pad, you won't lose the client. Okay?

00:06:34.252 --> 00:06:35.984
Well? Is it okay or not?

00:06:36.372 --> 00:06:37.731
- Okay.
- Totally okay.

00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:46.304
Damn, Aokbab is brilliant.

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:54.027
Hey, I think it's okay.

00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:55.937
It's beautiful.

00:07:05.683 --> 00:07:06.916
One moment, please.

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:14.649
The client just messaged. The Feng Shui master is okay with it.

00:07:14.902 --> 00:07:17.377
We can proceed. And we got an extension.

00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:25.872
So, what's the deal with you?

00:07:25.896 --> 00:07:27.940
You just got back. Why didn't you go home and rest?

00:07:28.307 --> 00:07:29.582
Why did you come to the office?

00:07:29.607 --> 00:07:30.657
If I hadn't come...

00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:32.362
you two would probably still be at each other's throats.

00:07:33.844 --> 00:07:35.374
What kind of company owner are you?

00:07:35.398 --> 00:07:36.520
Your management is terrible.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.949
Yeah, Pad, you're the worst.

00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:39.562
You too, Chan.

00:07:40.055 --> 00:07:41.602
Your indie attitude needs a limit.

00:07:41.743 --> 00:07:43.998
I know you could have fixed it, but you just wouldn't.

00:07:44.022 --> 00:07:45.234
You were just being lazy, weren't you?

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:51.072
And if I hear you two arguing again...

00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:52.560
I'm going back to Japan.

00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:53.867
Hey, calm down.

00:07:54.272 --> 00:07:55.733
We still need your help.

00:07:58.962 --> 00:08:01.975
So, how long will you be staying to help with the company?

00:08:02.692 --> 00:08:04.736
Until the company is no longer a total disaster...

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.694
that you two have created.

00:08:08.972 --> 00:08:10.837
I don't want our mother's company...

00:08:11.097 --> 00:08:12.877
to go bankrupt on our watch.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.774
If you feel that way...

00:08:15.253 --> 00:08:17.131
you should just stay and help us permanently.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.208
Pad can't handle it anymore.

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:20.325
You're the real problem. Don't make me...

00:08:20.349 --> 00:08:21.452
You're much worse than me.

00:08:21.492 --> 00:08:23.086
You're the problem...

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:26.409
If you two don't stop arguing...

00:08:26.433 --> 00:08:28.601
I'm going to stab you with this fork.

00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:33.522
Let me make myself perfectly clear.

00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:35.207
I am here...

00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:37.722
only to temporarily manage Mom's company.

00:08:37.933 --> 00:08:40.041
Once everything is better and the company is out of this crisis,

00:08:40.072 --> 00:08:41.279
I'm going back to Japan.

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:43.416
Then come help with the design work.

00:08:43.869 --> 00:08:45.611
I know how talented you are.

00:08:45.636 --> 00:08:46.644
Yes.

00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:49.313
And you know I stopped drawing a long time ago.

00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:56.328
Hey, where are you going?

00:08:56.441 --> 00:08:57.847
To the restroom. Wanna come?

00:09:00.732 --> 00:09:02.186
I thought she was going back to Japan.

00:09:03.034 --> 00:09:05.247
You're the real problem.

00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:20.866
[Mind - Pattarasaya Pitiworakul]
[Co-Founder]

00:09:21.368 --> 00:09:24.522
When it comes to leading architectural firms today,

00:09:24.592 --> 00:09:27.562
Mind Space is a name that has risen very quickly.

00:09:27.739 --> 00:09:29.507
And today, our show has the opportunity...

00:09:29.531 --> 00:09:31.402
to speak with a passionate, new-generation architect.

00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:33.214
In the world of architecture,

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:36.140
she's considered something of a rare find.

00:09:36.253 --> 00:09:38.182
Let's meet her now.

00:09:45.702 --> 00:09:47.692
The origin of Mind Space?

00:09:47.801 --> 00:09:49.018
Well, Mind Space...

00:09:49.043 --> 00:09:50.563
didn't start with just me.

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:53.230
I have to thank Mr. Thee, who is my senior,

00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:55.810
and also the partner who helped establish this company.

00:09:56.417 --> 00:09:57.517
I see.

00:09:58.271 --> 00:10:00.388
It's incredible. From a small company...

00:10:00.412 --> 00:10:02.037
that started with just two people...

00:10:02.497 --> 00:10:04.033
in less than 10 years,

00:10:04.058 --> 00:10:05.160
Mind Space is now...

00:10:05.184 --> 00:10:06.666
one of the most renowned names...

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.186
in residential design in the country.

00:10:09.446 --> 00:10:10.761
So, Ms. Mind, do you think...

00:10:10.785 --> 00:10:12.460
you have achieved success yet?

00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:15.933
I'd rather say the company is growing well.

00:10:16.292 --> 00:10:18.542
The word "success"...

00:10:18.566 --> 00:10:20.652
feels very limiting to me.

00:10:21.172 --> 00:10:23.467
I want to keep developing my work...

00:10:23.492 --> 00:10:25.372
for all of Mind Space's clients.

00:10:27.212 --> 00:10:28.107
Amazing.

00:10:28.132 --> 00:10:29.758
Is this a promote?

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:47.342
Hey, are you okay?

00:11:22.413 --> 00:11:23.315
Rin.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.614
Come help me with the delivery orders.

00:11:35.183 --> 00:11:36.186
Okay.

00:11:57.649 --> 00:11:58.942
Whoa.

00:11:59.149 --> 00:12:01.018
The picture you drew got this many likes?

00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:02.563
That's a lot.

00:12:04.595 --> 00:12:05.509
Hey.

00:12:06.604 --> 00:12:09.099
Go get a real job, Rin.

00:12:09.123 --> 00:12:11.178
How many years did you study architecture?

00:12:11.524 --> 00:12:13.877
So many people have reached out to you with job offers.

00:12:14.152 --> 00:12:15.817
Why end up selling coffee with me?

00:12:17.492 --> 00:12:21.258
I just haven't found a company that feels right.

00:12:21.652 --> 00:12:23.941
And recently, a famous company contacted me,

00:12:23.965 --> 00:12:25.299
but I just turned them down.

00:12:28.371 --> 00:12:30.177
And you have the nerve to be proud of it.

00:12:32.712 --> 00:12:33.898
Go on.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.606
Make yourself useful for once.

00:12:37.717 --> 00:12:39.945
Go pick up the pastries from the next alley for me.

00:12:39.969 --> 00:12:42.082
Tell them we'll settle the bill at the end of the month.

00:12:42.782 --> 00:12:44.122
Making me run errands again.

00:12:44.413 --> 00:12:45.901
Or would you rather not get paid for it?

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:49.407
Let's go.

00:13:34.802 --> 00:13:36.902
Hello. What can I get for you?

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.828
I'll take two of these, please.

00:13:44.853 --> 00:13:46.602
And an Americano to go.

00:13:47.554 --> 00:13:48.728
To go?

00:13:50.023 --> 00:13:51.303
Takeaway.

00:13:52.692 --> 00:13:54.011
Okay.

00:13:54.593 --> 00:13:56.493
That will be 290 baht in total.

00:14:01.618 --> 00:14:02.728
Done.

00:14:03.605 --> 00:14:04.841
Please wait a moment.

00:14:28.042 --> 00:14:29.375
Here you are.

00:14:31.672 --> 00:14:32.612
Thank you.

00:14:33.849 --> 00:14:35.217
Uh, excuse me.

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:37.012
Has this shop been open long?

00:14:37.267 --> 00:14:38.740
About five years.

00:14:38.765 --> 00:14:41.210
And during those five years, have there been any modifications...

00:14:41.234 --> 00:14:43.348
or extensions made to the building?

00:14:44.878 --> 00:14:46.444
No, I don't think so.

00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:48.548
It's been like this for as long as I've been here.

00:14:50.508 --> 00:14:51.736
Judging by the cracks,

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.662
it's likely caused by foundation settlement.

00:14:54.702 --> 00:14:56.399
You should have the structure inspected...

00:14:56.423 --> 00:14:57.862
before it gets more dangerous.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.525
The load-bearing structures...

00:14:59.549 --> 00:15:00.927
should be reinforced immediately.

00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:03.133
From what I can see, the wooden beam is starting to sag.

00:15:03.158 --> 00:15:04.868
You should add steel or wooden supports...

00:15:04.892 --> 00:15:06.681
to strengthen the beam.

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:08.860
Also, when I walked into the shop earlier,

00:15:08.884 --> 00:15:10.111
the AC didn't feel very cool.

00:15:10.136 --> 00:15:11.690
You should check the AC's BTU.

00:15:11.714 --> 00:15:12.985
It's probably not powerful enough.

00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:16.038
And have a technician seal the gaps in the wood panels.

00:15:16.062 --> 00:15:17.771
That should stop the cool air from escaping.

00:15:18.077 --> 00:15:19.626
That might help as well.

00:15:20.532 --> 00:15:22.811

I'm happy to give a free consultation.

Are you trying to hustle me for a job, lady?

00:15:37.665 --> 00:15:38.578
Lady?

00:15:39.766 --> 00:15:41.467
Who are you referring to? Me?

00:15:41.755 --> 00:15:42.694
Yeah, you.

00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:44.694
You're the only "lady" standing here.

00:15:44.718 --> 00:15:46.607
And trying to sell your services like this?

00:15:46.807 --> 00:15:48.034
It's not going to work.

00:15:48.732 --> 00:15:49.919
I'm not trying to sell anything.

00:15:49.943 --> 00:15:50.998
Then what do you call it?

00:15:51.023 --> 00:15:52.485
Just walking in and rattling on and on...

00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:54.969
and then handing out your company's IG?

- I was just offer some advice...
- Don't make excuses.

00:15:58.149 --> 00:15:59.411
If you're going to renovate a building...

00:15:59.435 --> 00:16:01.231
without getting the owner's permission first,

00:16:01.255 --> 00:16:02.463
that's illegal.

00:16:02.765 --> 00:16:03.742
Did you know that?

00:16:07.792 --> 00:16:09.429
My pastries, please.

Are you an architect?

You seem to know a lot.

00:16:13.792 --> 00:16:16.945
I could see you were trying to sell your services from a mile away.

00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:19.801
I told you, I wasn't.

00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:21.459

Show some respect for your elders.

00:16:23.578 --> 00:16:25.765
When you can't win, you play the age card.

00:16:30.234 --> 00:16:31.749
And do you know something?

00:16:31.773 --> 00:16:33.627
Do you know how I got to be this old?

00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:37.466
Because I'm not a smart-mouth like you.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.003
That's how I've lived so long.

00:16:39.938 --> 00:16:40.949
A mouth like that...

00:16:40.974 --> 00:16:42.529
says a lot about your character.

00:17:03.384 --> 00:17:05.111
What are you doing, lady? Stealing a car?

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:07.507
Is this your scooter?

00:17:07.705 --> 00:17:08.659
Yeah.

00:17:08.992 --> 00:17:10.311
What were you thinking, parking like this?

00:17:10.335 --> 00:17:11.609
I was using my brain. Why?

00:17:14.317 --> 00:17:16.063
Move it. I need to get out.

00:17:19.393 --> 00:17:20.799
Hey, where are my keys?

00:17:20.823 --> 00:17:23.178
Oops, there are so many of them.

00:17:23.202 --> 00:17:24.936
Which one could it be?

00:17:25.852 --> 00:17:27.046
Oh, I forgot.

00:17:27.405 --> 00:17:28.779
I forgot I don't need one.

Well...

Recently...

00:19:50.534 --> 00:19:52.090
our company has had...

00:19:52.114 --> 00:19:53.268
several projects cancelled.

00:19:54.324 --> 00:19:55.350
And...

00:19:55.523 --> 00:19:57.316
the company that's been snatching our projects...

00:19:57.568 --> 00:19:58.922
is Mind Space.

00:20:01.128 --> 00:20:02.192
Their method is...

00:20:02.216 --> 00:20:04.276
they'll bid whatever it takes to undercut everyone else...

00:20:04.301 --> 00:20:05.396
to steal the clients.

00:20:05.821 --> 00:20:07.456
If I try to compete with their prices,

00:20:08.744 --> 00:20:09.864
there's no way we can survive.

00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:12.207
Because with the prices they offer clients,

00:20:12.232 --> 00:20:13.705
there's no way to finish the job.

00:25:40.036 --> 00:25:41.555
So I got someone else.

00:25:41.579 --> 00:25:42.846
But this person is okay too.

00:25:42.966 --> 00:25:44.326
I'll have HR send you their resume.

00:25:44.761 --> 00:25:45.649
Why?

00:25:45.673 --> 00:25:46.880
Was the salary not high enough?

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.535
No.

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:50.484
She just said she didn't want to work with Mind Space.

00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:54.864
A rookie dared to reject us?

00:25:55.304 --> 00:25:57.431
Forget it. It's just one person.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:59.206
Remember this, Mind.

00:26:00.114 --> 00:26:01.556
If you want to grow,

00:26:01.793 --> 00:26:03.413
don't waste your time on just one person.

00:26:04.835 --> 00:26:06.201
And if you want something,

00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:08.074
take the whole company.

00:26:08.896 --> 00:26:10.939
Can you stop buying other companies?

00:26:10.963 --> 00:26:12.884
We can barely manage what we have.

00:26:13.044 --> 00:26:15.117
We have so much work already.

00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:16.776
We don't have that many people to manage it.

00:26:17.016 --> 00:26:18.667
If we start losing money,

00:26:18.691 --> 00:26:20.393
we're all going to be exhausted.

00:26:20.753 --> 00:26:22.641
Hey, don't worry.

00:26:22.665 --> 00:26:23.925
I can handle it.

00:26:24.538 --> 00:26:26.740
I'll make Mind Space a national name.

00:26:27.254 --> 00:26:28.394
Trust me.

00:27:07.423 --> 00:27:09.056
[Profit/Loss Summary]
[Net Loss: 23,545,625]

00:27:22.888 --> 00:27:24.277
I forgot I don't need one.

00:27:24.301 --> 00:27:25.426
It's a new model.

00:27:25.706 --> 00:27:27.368
Not old like you, lady.

00:27:29.996 --> 00:27:31.799
It's all because of that damn brat.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.993
[JINTA Architect]

00:27:48.839 --> 00:27:50.199
Okay, everyone's here.

00:27:51.512 --> 00:27:52.654
I've called this meeting today...

00:27:52.678 --> 00:27:54.976
because I have good news and bad news.

00:27:55.249 --> 00:27:56.509
Let's start with the good news.

00:27:56.949 --> 00:27:58.292
Mr. Rain and Ms. Mink,

00:27:58.679 --> 00:28:00.319
the famous high-society couple...

00:28:01.636 --> 00:28:02.933
Mr. Rain and Ms. Mink...

00:28:02.958 --> 00:28:05.431
want to renovate their vacation home.

00:28:06.163 --> 00:28:07.597
The bad news is...

00:28:08.578 --> 00:28:10.266
we have to win the pitch against other firms.

00:28:11.862 --> 00:28:13.728
Only then will we get this project.

00:28:16.103 --> 00:28:18.297
Even though it's a small project,

00:28:18.321 --> 00:28:19.982
just renovating one house,

00:28:20.196 --> 00:28:22.303
everyone must remember that Mr. Rain and Ms. Mink...

00:28:22.576 --> 00:28:24.250
are well-known public figures.

00:28:24.716 --> 00:28:25.798
They have a lot of connections.

00:28:26.116 --> 00:28:27.916
This means if we get this project,

00:28:28.483 --> 00:28:31.463
our company has a chance to get many jobs from them in the long run.

00:28:34.428 --> 00:28:37.092
So who will be the lead on this project?

00:28:37.117 --> 00:28:38.838
I was planning to have Yong take care of it.

00:28:39.933 --> 00:28:41.326
I don't think I can handle it.

00:28:41.505 --> 00:28:43.239
Anyone else?

00:28:46.462 --> 00:28:48.348
Is this all the architects we have?

00:28:48.648 --> 00:28:51.088
Actually, I've already posted job openings.

00:28:51.801 --> 00:28:53.134
But no one has applied yet.

00:28:59.459 --> 00:29:00.959
I have a close friend.

00:29:03.551 --> 00:29:05.586
She's so good that our classmates called her 'Master Rin'.

00:29:06.252 --> 00:29:07.994
In class, she was always in competitions.

00:29:08.018 --> 00:29:09.505
She swept up awards every year.

00:29:09.671 --> 00:29:11.216
She's getting famous on IG right now.

00:29:25.849 --> 00:29:27.246
I think I've seen her before.

00:29:28.139 --> 00:29:29.357
I really like her work.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:33.914
What do you think?

00:30:03.107 --> 00:30:04.122
Tertis,

00:30:04.147 --> 00:30:05.790
could you contact her for us?

00:30:08.674 --> 00:30:09.661
Yes.

00:30:11.716 --> 00:30:12.706
But...

00:30:15.129 --> 00:30:16.826
there's one thing I have to tell you first.

00:30:25.931 --> 00:30:28.976
Thee, are you really asking me to oversee a single-house renovation?

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.757
There are so many other major projects.

00:30:32.523 --> 00:30:34.476
Can't a smaller team handle this?

00:30:35.831 --> 00:30:37.404
It's not just any house.

00:30:37.911 --> 00:30:39.301
It's Mr. Rain's house.

00:30:39.325 --> 00:30:40.682
That's why I want you to be in charge.

00:30:44.388 --> 00:30:46.518
Which other companies are pitching for this job?

00:30:50.911 --> 00:30:52.374
This is so damn annoying.

00:30:52.846 --> 00:30:54.746
Mr. Rain also invited JINTA.

00:30:55.565 --> 00:30:56.827
I really hate that bastard Pad.

00:30:56.851 --> 00:30:58.221
And his weirdo brother.

00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:04.327
Anyway, Mind,

00:31:04.351 --> 00:31:06.318
I'm leaving this project in your hands.

00:31:06.593 --> 00:31:07.781
As for the pitching day,

00:31:07.805 --> 00:31:09.286
we'll decide later if you'll go or not.

00:31:10.046 --> 00:31:11.019
Got it.

00:31:19.022 --> 00:31:20.517
I heard that Pad brought his younger sister...

00:31:20.541 --> 00:31:22.142
back to help at the company.

00:31:30.064 --> 00:31:31.238
How did you know?

00:31:32.234 --> 00:31:33.142
Vee told me.

00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:34.507
So I did some digging.

00:31:34.758 --> 00:31:37.128
It seems his sister flew back from Japan...

00:31:37.152 --> 00:31:38.739
specifically to help with the company.

00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:43.196
In that case,

00:31:43.922 --> 00:31:45.615
I'll go to the pitch myself.

00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:49.274
I'm counting on you.

00:32:03.356 --> 00:32:06.501
Here's your drink, customer.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.254
You took your time.

00:32:08.278 --> 00:32:09.768
You're lucky I brought it to you at all.

00:32:09.792 --> 00:32:10.714
Tip me.

00:32:10.738 --> 00:32:12.061
Thank you.

00:32:16.246 --> 00:32:17.879
It's sour. Is this spoiled?

00:32:18.698 --> 00:32:19.619
Then don't eat it.

00:32:29.976 --> 00:32:31.369
Sushi from near the university.

00:32:32.006 --> 00:32:33.086
Your favorite place.

00:32:36.613 --> 00:32:38.153
Bringing me an offering like this...

00:32:39.548 --> 00:32:40.961
What do you want? Spit it out.

00:32:41.374 --> 00:32:42.694
Okay, I'll be direct.

00:32:43.014 --> 00:32:45.344
As someone who's been your friend since freshman year...

00:32:45.974 --> 00:32:48.102
please let me finish before you freak out.

00:32:54.096 --> 00:32:55.206
Still tastes amazing.

00:32:56.431 --> 00:32:57.804
Fine. Go ahead.

00:32:58.701 --> 00:32:59.634
Right now,

00:32:59.981 --> 00:33:02.100
my company is looking for a new architect.

00:33:02.311 --> 00:33:04.226
Your skills are god-tier...

00:33:04.418 --> 00:33:06.972
and you happen to have the exact qualifications we're looking for.

00:33:07.471 --> 00:33:09.307
I want to invite you to work with us. Interested?

00:33:10.751 --> 00:33:11.657
You know...

00:33:12.222 --> 00:33:13.977
that I don't want to join any company.

00:33:15.183 --> 00:33:16.205
Rin.

00:33:16.508 --> 00:33:17.782
Let me ask you seriously.

00:33:18.016 --> 00:33:19.712
Why won't you get a job?

00:33:19.736 --> 00:33:21.236
You're so talented.

00:33:21.487 --> 00:33:23.261
Why keep all that skill to yourself?

00:33:23.963 --> 00:33:25.633
I just haven't found a company I like.

00:33:25.657 --> 00:33:27.637
You might like my company.

00:33:28.939 --> 00:33:29.966
Come on.

00:33:31.904 --> 00:33:32.786
At least give it a chance.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.538
Just talk to my boss first, can you?

00:33:38.651 --> 00:33:39.547
How about this?

00:33:40.301 --> 00:33:42.274
For the sake of our friendship since freshman year...

00:33:43.995 --> 00:33:45.788
The Pritt glue, the Nitto tape,

00:33:45.813 --> 00:33:46.741
the foam board,

00:33:46.766 --> 00:33:47.716
the steel ruler you borrowed from me...

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.029
and never replaced...

00:33:49.053 --> 00:33:50.508
See how much money I lost?

00:33:50.532 --> 00:33:51.627
I never asked for it back.

00:33:51.859 --> 00:33:54.273
And all the sushi you stole from me for four years...

00:33:54.297 --> 00:33:55.411
I never asked for that back either.

00:33:57.684 --> 00:33:58.737
Fine, I'll do it.

00:34:03.569 --> 00:34:04.695
You said it.

00:34:05.162 --> 00:34:06.521
Don't you dare take it back.

00:34:06.545 --> 00:34:09.679
But I'm only agreeing to talk.

00:34:09.918 --> 00:34:11.711
I'm not promising I'll join the company.

00:34:11.886 --> 00:34:13.033
That's up to you.

00:34:17.471 --> 00:34:19.414
My boss graduated from Japan, you know.

00:34:26.432 --> 00:34:27.939
Now that's a little more interesting.

00:34:29.561 --> 00:34:30.821
What day are you free?

00:34:31.302 --> 00:34:32.549
I'll set up a meeting at the office for you.

00:34:34.068 --> 00:34:36.008
Who said I was coming to your office?

00:34:37.431 --> 00:34:38.335
Huh?

00:34:38.465 --> 00:34:39.467
If not at the office,

00:34:39.492 --> 00:34:41.026
how are you going to talk to my boss?

00:34:49.233 --> 00:34:50.786
Rin...

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.085
You want me to go to her?

00:35:05.371 --> 00:35:06.161
Yes.

00:35:06.281 --> 00:35:08.076
If they want me,

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.523
they have to come to me.

00:35:10.813 --> 00:35:12.942
If you really want to hire her,

00:35:13.028 --> 00:35:15.141
Ms. Aokbab has to go see her in person.

00:35:15.252 --> 00:35:16.732
Only then will she agree to talk.

00:35:24.031 --> 00:35:26.011
Is this how people work in Thailand?

00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:27.450
This is ridiculous.

00:35:27.474 --> 00:35:29.788
The employee makes the employer come to them.

00:35:30.431 --> 00:35:32.747
But we're the ones who want to hire her, right, Aokbab?

00:35:34.551 --> 00:35:36.128
It wouldn't be that strange to go see her.

00:35:37.371 --> 00:35:38.538
Just go and try.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.131
I did some research.

00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:48.845
Mr. Rain follows 'Master Rin' on Instagram.

00:35:49.128 --> 00:35:50.217
That means Mr. Rain...

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:52.570
is a fan of Master Rin's work.

00:35:53.472 --> 00:35:55.651
If we can get this kid to work with us,

00:35:55.931 --> 00:35:57.878
it means our chances of winning will increase.

00:36:03.667 --> 00:36:06.086
But if you won't do it for me,

00:36:07.308 --> 00:36:08.796
do it for the numbers in our bank account.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:09.923
Red.

00:36:10.087 --> 00:36:11.190
Red.

00:36:11.607 --> 00:36:12.710
Red.

00:36:13.173 --> 00:36:14.276
Red.

00:36:14.723 --> 00:36:16.503
Alright, alright!

00:36:16.898 --> 00:36:17.838
I'll go.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.807
Okay, I'll send you the location.

00:36:20.035 --> 00:36:21.448
Aren't you coming with me?

00:36:21.602 --> 00:36:24.181
Rin said the boss has to come alone.

00:36:25.863 --> 00:36:27.976
Also, I bought you some pastries from Rin's shop.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:30.000
Excuse me.

00:37:33.662 --> 00:37:35.399
You, I'm not playing. Please let me through.

00:37:35.424 --> 00:37:37.374
Hey! What's your problem?

00:37:37.405 --> 00:37:38.381
Let go.

00:37:38.921 --> 00:37:39.897
Let go.

00:37:39.908 --> 00:37:40.884
Let go!

00:37:41.877 --> 00:37:43.330
What is wrong with you?

00:37:50.255 --> 00:37:51.975
Hey, you!

00:37:52.316 --> 00:37:53.865
You, are you okay?

00:37:53.889 --> 00:37:54.736
You!

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:11.743
Rin!

00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:14.233
Rin!

00:38:14.797 --> 00:38:16.177
How do I open this?

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:17.483
Where is it?

00:38:20.509 --> 00:38:21.836
Rin! Rin!

00:38:27.324 --> 00:38:29.713
How are you? Are you feeling better?

00:38:49.425 --> 00:38:50.891
Lady. What are you doing here?

00:38:51.373 --> 00:38:53.568
Rin! Address her properly.

00:38:54.628 --> 00:38:56.427
Please forgive my sister's behavior.

00:38:58.713 --> 00:39:00.323
Prim, why are you apologizing?

00:39:00.348 --> 00:39:02.389
This lady clearly attacked me.

00:39:03.029 --> 00:39:04.531
It's more like you did it to yourself.

00:39:04.555 --> 00:39:06.311
Who's the one acting weird,

00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:08.133
standing in the sun in a hot costume?

00:39:08.968 --> 00:39:10.863
If she hadn't helped you,

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:12.916
you'd be in the hospital by now.

00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:21.267
What are you here for?

00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:23.468
I'm Tertis's boss.

00:39:23.572 --> 00:39:24.893
Then you can leave.

00:39:27.624 --> 00:39:28.978
I'm not talking.

00:39:34.621 --> 00:39:36.194
We need to talk.

00:39:37.389 --> 00:39:38.603
Sit.

00:39:44.584 --> 00:39:46.352
I'll go get some water for you.

00:40:00.017 --> 00:40:01.330
The reason I came here today...

00:40:01.671 --> 00:40:04.085
is because I want to recruit you to work for our company,

00:40:04.133 --> 00:40:05.483
at JINTA Architect.

00:40:05.507 --> 00:40:06.721
Give me a reason.

00:40:08.047 --> 00:40:09.234
Why?

00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:12.170
Our company...

00:40:12.194 --> 00:40:14.482
particularly admires your style and your work.

00:40:14.711 --> 00:40:16.398
We see that you have potential...

00:40:16.422 --> 00:40:18.749
and would be a perfect fit for one of our projects.

00:40:20.928 --> 00:40:22.627
So you're saying...

00:40:22.878 --> 00:40:24.752
I'm talented, right?

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.381
Let's just say you have what our company needs.

00:40:32.245 --> 00:40:34.005
In that case,

00:40:34.953 --> 00:40:36.679
lady, try praising me first.

00:40:37.133 --> 00:40:38.206
Say that I'm talented.

00:40:44.785 --> 00:40:46.298
If you don't say it...

00:40:46.731 --> 00:40:48.218
you can just leave.

00:40:57.355 --> 00:40:58.455
Fine.

00:40:59.691 --> 00:41:01.564
As a fellow architect,

00:41:04.782 --> 00:41:06.652
I admit that you are skilled.

00:41:07.116 --> 00:41:08.310
Are you satisfied now?

00:41:09.672 --> 00:41:10.802
Satisfied.

00:41:10.826 --> 00:41:12.060
Very satisfying.

00:41:12.526 --> 00:41:13.706
But...

00:41:15.112 --> 00:41:17.334
I'm not going to work for your company, lady.

00:41:18.631 --> 00:41:19.559
Honestly?

00:41:19.583 --> 00:41:21.858
Every company that's approached me is the same.

00:41:21.883 --> 00:41:22.971
Including yours.

00:41:23.208 --> 00:41:25.096
Our JINTA Architect is not like the others.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:26.203
How is it different?

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:27.456
What makes it so special?

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:32.863
Did you add an egg or something?

00:41:37.391 --> 00:41:38.452
It's true.

00:41:39.058 --> 00:41:41.562
Our company might not be more special than others.

00:41:42.415 --> 00:41:44.602
It's just one small company.

00:41:50.287 --> 00:41:51.736
Our company grew...

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.061
from my mother's love for design.

00:42:00.316 --> 00:42:02.207
Even though my mother has passed away,

00:42:02.685 --> 00:42:05.586
we are trying to carry on her legacy.

00:42:06.668 --> 00:42:08.688
We always strive to do our best work.

00:42:29.647 --> 00:42:31.973
Our company works like a family.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.959
I promise you,

00:42:34.293 --> 00:42:35.672
that I will be fair to all our employees.

00:42:35.696 --> 00:42:37.938
Including you, if you agree to work with us.

00:42:38.831 --> 00:42:39.666
What do you think?

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:41.658
Are you interested in working with us?

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:50.763
I am interested.

00:43:16.978 --> 00:43:18.171
Let's go.

00:43:27.901 --> 00:43:28.862
Lady.

00:43:29.605 --> 00:43:30.880
I have something to tell you.

00:43:32.133 --> 00:43:33.880
What is it?

00:43:36.314 --> 00:43:37.527
What you just said...

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.207
it was really good.

00:43:40.431 --> 00:43:41.523
I really liked it.

00:43:41.547 --> 00:43:43.168
The way you talked about your company.

00:43:52.915 --> 00:43:55.011
But I would never work with you.

00:43:56.879 --> 00:43:58.745
Go sell your dream to someone else.

00:43:59.201 --> 00:44:00.421
Bye-bye.

00:44:11.524 --> 00:44:12.944
This bag is expensive!

00:44:14.779 --> 00:44:16.012
You little brat.

00:44:21.253 --> 00:44:22.253
[JINTA Architect]

00:44:22.278 --> 00:44:23.379
Look at this.

00:44:24.365 --> 00:44:25.874
This is getting weird.

00:44:25.898 --> 00:44:27.058
How did it go?

00:44:28.549 --> 00:44:30.396
What do they think I am? Made of stone?

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.047
They keep asking to hold. For what?!

00:44:35.754 --> 00:44:37.550
Don't tell me there's more bad news.

00:44:40.079 --> 00:44:41.560
It's the client.

00:44:41.584 --> 00:44:43.658
Another one just called to put their project on hold.

00:44:44.841 --> 00:44:45.930
But what about you?

00:44:45.954 --> 00:44:47.401
How did your talk with Master Rin go?

00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:50.983
Don't say that kid's name again.

00:44:53.628 --> 00:44:54.761
Oh. Why?

00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:02.441
Ms. Aokbab.

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:04.201
How did it go?

00:45:08.357 --> 00:45:09.690
It is what it is.

00:45:10.177 --> 00:45:11.018
Tertis.

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:13.110
What now?

00:45:13.329 --> 00:45:14.340
Is there any way...

00:45:14.364 --> 00:45:16.185
to make your friend change her mind?

00:45:16.924 --> 00:45:17.944
Well...

00:45:18.477 --> 00:45:20.505
Rin is a big foodie.

00:45:20.836 --> 00:45:22.744
Last time, I had to bring her a food offering.

00:45:22.769 --> 00:45:24.026
That's the only reason she agreed to talk.

00:45:24.506 --> 00:45:25.401
How about this?

00:45:25.694 --> 00:45:27.863
Why don't you try taking her out for a nice meal?

00:45:27.887 --> 00:45:28.949
She might soften up.

00:45:29.279 --> 00:45:30.590
She lives for food.

00:45:30.987 --> 00:45:33.607
So now I have to take that brat out for a meal?

00:45:33.632 --> 00:45:34.733
For what?

00:45:34.758 --> 00:45:36.059
For our company.

00:45:36.635 --> 00:45:37.782
Just keep this in mind.

00:45:38.269 --> 00:45:40.248
Mr. Rain likes Master Rin's work.

00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:41.741
If we get her,

00:45:41.765 --> 00:45:43.024
our company will be saved.

00:45:43.252 --> 00:45:44.447
Didn't you say it yourself?

00:45:44.471 --> 00:45:46.129
That you came back to manage the company?

00:45:46.338 --> 00:45:48.470
This is management.

00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:49.892
You have to fight for it.

00:45:49.916 --> 00:45:51.571
Just remember: for the company.

00:45:51.596 --> 00:45:53.649
For the company, for the company.

00:45:54.973 --> 00:45:56.173
We absolutely have to get her?

00:45:56.198 --> 00:45:57.912
Isn't there a better option?

00:45:58.014 --> 00:45:58.818
Yes.

00:45:58.842 --> 00:45:59.869
For the company.

00:46:10.284 --> 00:46:11.231
Fine.

00:46:12.295 --> 00:46:14.212
I'll do it for Mom's company.

00:46:14.395 --> 00:46:16.018
But as soon as this job is done,

00:46:16.494 --> 00:46:18.171
I'm going back to Japan.

00:46:18.722 --> 00:46:19.989
Hey!

00:46:36.849 --> 00:46:39.814
Prim, let's eat. I'm hungry.

00:46:51.766 --> 00:46:53.279
Lady, what are you doing here again?

00:46:53.789 --> 00:46:54.931
Let's go eat.

00:46:54.955 --> 00:46:57.099
I know a really delicious restaurant.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:58.667
Not going.

00:46:58.691 --> 00:47:00.278
Prim already made dinner for me.

00:47:01.028 --> 00:47:03.217
Oops, it's all spilled. No dinner for you now.

00:47:03.241 --> 00:47:04.529
You'll have to find something to eat on your own.

00:47:04.981 --> 00:47:06.786
What are you doing?

00:47:08.574 --> 00:47:10.709
Let's go. I'm sure you'll like it.

00:47:13.614 --> 00:47:14.778
Not going.

00:47:14.802 --> 00:47:15.831
Not eating.

00:47:15.855 --> 00:47:17.049
Not hungry.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.157
Hey, don't think I'm going to cook for you.

00:47:20.492 --> 00:47:21.872
I'm tired and sleepy.

00:47:21.896 --> 00:47:23.156
I'm about to close the shop.

00:47:23.654 --> 00:47:25.571
You're totally forcing my hand.

00:47:26.294 --> 00:47:27.586
So, are you going or not?

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:34.742
Fine, I'll go.

00:47:35.459 --> 00:47:38.229
But, absolutely no talking about work.

00:47:38.254 --> 00:47:39.389
- Got it?
- Deal.

00:47:41.798 --> 00:47:42.752
Where are you going?

00:47:42.776 --> 00:47:44.017
To get my bag.

00:47:47.382 --> 00:47:48.815
Please take care of Rin for me.

00:48:10.244 --> 00:48:11.233
Hey.

00:48:11.725 --> 00:48:12.995
Why aren't you getting out?

00:48:13.019 --> 00:48:14.274
Aren't you hungry?

00:48:14.967 --> 00:48:16.727
Hurry up, I'm about to lock the car.

00:48:35.214 --> 00:48:36.785
We're here. Come on in.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:04.258
Ah, welcome.

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:05.917
Please wait a moment.

00:49:05.941 --> 00:49:07.919
Ahh.

00:49:07.943 --> 00:49:09.179
Hello.

00:49:09.203 --> 00:49:10.481
Please take care of us.

00:49:10.506 --> 00:49:12.022
Thank you for the great service.

00:49:12.046 --> 00:49:13.929
It's our pleasure.

00:49:14.658 --> 00:49:18.342
Is this the lady who you said likes Japanese food?

00:49:19.078 --> 00:49:20.451
Yes, she is.

00:49:24.071 --> 00:49:26.114
Then please have a seat right here.

00:49:26.139 --> 00:49:27.005
Please.

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.113
Okay.

00:49:29.759 --> 00:49:31.112
You speak Japanese quite well.

00:49:43.236 --> 00:49:46.546
Here you are. Fried tofu in broth,

00:49:46.571 --> 00:49:49.082
sashimi,

00:49:49.107 --> 00:49:51.206
and salmon roe sushi,

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:54.132
and eel sushi.

00:49:54.426 --> 00:49:55.571
Yes.

00:49:56.591 --> 00:49:58.939
Please, enjoy your meal.

00:50:05.058 --> 00:50:06.441
- I'll enjoy having this.
- I'll enjoy having this.

00:50:09.904 --> 00:50:11.339
Why are you copying me?

00:50:11.363 --> 00:50:12.890
You're the one who's copying me.

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:37.489
Do you know what the heart of Japanese cuisine is?

00:50:39.284 --> 00:50:40.171
What?

00:50:41.353 --> 00:50:42.563
Simplicity.

00:50:42.794 --> 00:50:45.201
There's no need for excessive seasoning.

00:50:45.667 --> 00:50:47.829
It focuses on highlighting the flavor of the ingredients.

00:50:48.777 --> 00:50:51.199
So we get to taste their true essence.

00:50:53.454 --> 00:50:55.467
Makes sense, since you graduated from Japan.

00:50:58.734 --> 00:51:00.081
Of course.

00:51:06.526 --> 00:51:08.093
So, how did you know?

00:51:08.612 --> 00:51:10.043
That I like Japanese food?

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:28.890
Hey.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.382
Ms. Aokbab?

00:51:30.722 --> 00:51:33.129
Is Rin at the shop right now?

00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:36.632
Yes, she is. Is something wrong?

00:51:38.629 --> 00:51:41.169
I'd like to invite her out for a dinner.

00:51:41.194 --> 00:51:43.960
And I was hoping to discuss work with her again.

00:51:46.587 --> 00:51:49.267
Then, I'll help you, Ms. Aokbab.

00:51:50.419 --> 00:51:51.973
Thank you so much.

00:51:54.029 --> 00:51:55.189
Ms. Prim,

00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:57.860
Actually,

00:51:57.885 --> 00:52:00.088
I've been meaning to ask you since this afternoon.

00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:03.545
Did you design this shop yourself?

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:05.000
It's very lovely.

00:52:05.025 --> 00:52:07.630
I didn't expect to find a shop like this around here.

00:52:08.253 --> 00:52:09.541
It wasn't me.

00:52:09.566 --> 00:52:11.240
Rin was the one who designed it.

00:52:11.265 --> 00:52:14.413
At first, she wanted a Japanese style.

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:16.416
Because she's really into Japanese things.

00:52:16.441 --> 00:52:18.571
But I prefer a Cottage style.

00:52:19.192 --> 00:52:20.853
She was very accommodating.

00:52:21.194 --> 00:52:22.908
So we agreed that,

00:52:22.933 --> 00:52:25.145
she would do the drafting herself.

00:52:25.254 --> 00:52:28.041
And she supervised almost all of the construction.

00:52:28.165 --> 00:52:29.832
And another thing,

00:52:29.857 --> 00:52:32.405
she tried to design everything,

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:34.697
exactly as I wanted.

00:53:00.478 --> 00:53:02.765
Here you go. Please.

00:53:04.172 --> 00:53:06.318
It's very delicious.

00:53:13.491 --> 00:53:14.553
No.

00:53:14.577 --> 00:53:16.153
Try saying it again.

00:53:16.679 --> 00:53:17.599
Slowly.

00:53:23.112 --> 00:53:27.159
It's very delicious.

00:53:31.593 --> 00:53:33.659
It's very delicious.

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:38.076
It's very delicious.

00:53:38.101 --> 00:53:39.227
It's very...

00:53:39.251 --> 00:53:40.300
It's very...

00:53:40.324 --> 00:53:41.293
It's very...

00:53:41.317 --> 00:53:42.277
It's very...

00:53:42.302 --> 00:53:44.263
It's very delicious.

00:53:45.718 --> 00:53:47.178
It's very delicious.

00:53:47.203 --> 00:53:48.547
Stop it, lady. Are you messing with me?

00:53:48.571 --> 00:53:49.843
I said it right the first time.

00:53:50.348 --> 00:53:51.529
I said it right.

00:53:57.306 --> 00:53:58.726
Thank you.

00:53:59.514 --> 00:54:01.001
You could speak Thai and didn't say so.

00:54:04.893 --> 00:54:07.328
This is plum wine.

00:54:07.353 --> 00:54:11.053
My wife brewed it herself.

00:54:11.893 --> 00:54:12.983
This...

00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:16.205
is a complimentary treat for our special customers.

00:54:16.229 --> 00:54:17.930
One glass each.

00:54:19.006 --> 00:54:20.812
Thank you.

00:54:45.236 --> 00:54:46.676
About my offer...

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.163
will you reconsider it?

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:51.464
I really do like your work.

00:54:52.773 --> 00:54:54.310
I thought we weren't going to talk about work.

00:54:55.854 --> 00:54:57.425
Please think about it.

00:54:57.918 --> 00:54:59.191
I'll be waiting for your answer.

00:55:23.423 --> 00:55:24.796
How about this, lady?

00:55:27.118 --> 00:55:28.491
Let's have a competition.

00:55:30.181 --> 00:55:31.255
What kind of competition?

00:55:32.691 --> 00:55:34.698
Finish this entire jar of plum wine.

00:55:35.721 --> 00:55:37.061
If you can hold your liquor...

00:55:38.003 --> 00:55:40.011
I might consider working for you.

00:55:45.307 --> 00:55:48.218
But if you lose, it's over.

00:55:52.572 --> 00:55:53.612
You're on.

00:56:00.642 --> 00:56:02.842
Can I buy this whole jar?

00:56:02.867 --> 00:56:04.491
Okay!

00:57:07.519 --> 00:57:08.566
The wine's all gone.

00:57:09.208 --> 00:57:10.414
What now?

00:57:11.523 --> 00:57:13.015
If it's gone, order more.

00:57:20.284 --> 00:57:21.584
Chef!

00:57:22.444 --> 00:57:24.665
Bring us the strongest liquor in the house!

00:57:25.507 --> 00:57:26.708
Right away!

00:57:26.733 --> 00:57:28.931
A legend is born!

00:57:28.956 --> 00:57:32.478
Cheers!

00:57:32.502 --> 00:57:34.670
Next up is sake!

00:57:34.695 --> 00:57:37.447
Cheers!

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:54.238
How about this?

00:57:54.262 --> 00:57:55.863
Whoever can stand up straight...

00:57:56.422 --> 00:57:57.662
is the winner.

00:57:58.377 --> 00:57:59.236
Deal.

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.961
On the count of three,

00:58:00.986 --> 00:58:02.475
whoever can stand up straight...

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:05.693
wins.

00:58:07.281 --> 00:58:08.192
One...

00:58:08.469 --> 00:58:09.356
Two...

00:58:10.974 --> 00:58:12.194
Three!

00:58:25.748 --> 00:58:26.708
Look.

00:58:35.582 --> 00:58:37.536
So weak.

00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:59.716
Why did you kick me?

00:59:59.918 --> 01:00:01.825
Lady, what are you doing?

01:00:02.093 --> 01:00:03.514
And how did I get here?

01:00:03.538 --> 01:00:05.098
Whose clothes are these?

01:00:05.551 --> 01:00:06.977
They're my clothes.

01:00:07.083 --> 01:00:08.578
Why are you wearing them?

01:00:09.011 --> 01:00:10.538
How should I know?

01:00:14.576 --> 01:00:15.985
What happened?

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:02.447
Is it possible to fall in love by a drawing?

01:01:19.404 --> 01:01:20.778
You're the one who should thank me.

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:23.090
Otherwise, you would've been sleeping on the street.

01:01:23.115 --> 01:01:24.550
Regarding the offer you asked about,

01:01:24.575 --> 01:01:26.261
I have an answer now.

01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:27.930
I'll work with you.

01:01:27.955 --> 01:01:29.885
We still need Rin's help, Aokbab.

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:31.353
Try to be nice to her.

01:01:31.378 --> 01:01:32.352
Fine, whatever.

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.269
Ms. Aokbab,

01:01:34.294 --> 01:01:36.687
Mr. Rain's secretary wants to meet with you urgently.

01:01:36.858 --> 01:01:37.970
Make yourselves comfortable.

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:39.970
We're just waiting for one more team.

01:01:41.154 --> 01:01:43.161
Hello, Mr. Rain, Ms. Mink.

01:01:45.308 --> 01:01:47.628
I think we'll be meeting a lot more after this.

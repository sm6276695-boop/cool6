Yan.

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:54.442
I liked you

00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:57.162
and trusted you so much.

00:02:01.808 --> 00:02:03.760
How could you have been lying
to us for so long?

00:02:04.923 --> 00:02:05.802
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:02:09.523 --> 00:02:11.042
I'll take all the consequences.

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.442
If this gets out,

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:17.683
it'll affect Haoming

00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:19.042
and the company's reputation.

00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:21.403
You can't handle the result.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.243
I'll comply with your wishes.

00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:26.642
I won't make any excuses.

00:02:29.442 --> 00:02:30.322
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:33.003
I know apologies aren't enough

00:02:33.283 --> 00:02:34.882
to make up for my mistakes.

00:02:35.803 --> 00:02:37.602
I'll bear all legal responsibilities.

00:02:38.922 --> 00:02:39.602
Now,

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:43.442
the New District project
is just starting.

00:02:43.683 --> 00:02:44.843
It's the most critical phase.

00:02:45.283 --> 00:02:46.123
As for how you two

00:02:46.243 --> 00:02:47.642
handle personal matters,

00:02:47.882 --> 00:02:48.922
I won't interfere.

00:02:49.123 --> 00:02:50.482
But you must understand this:

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:53.162
it absolutely cannot affect

00:02:53.162 --> 00:02:55.003
the company's prestige and reputation.

00:02:55.283 --> 00:02:55.922
I understand.

00:02:57.803 --> 00:03:00.482
Until the paperwork is finalized,

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:02.523
I'll publicly claim
I'm starting a business.

00:03:11.722 --> 00:03:12.283
Mom, Dad,

00:03:14.442 --> 00:03:16.283
if Haochen returns and asks about me,

00:03:17.803 --> 00:03:19.922
just say I'm too busy to come back.

00:03:25.523 --> 00:03:26.243
I'm sorry.

00:03:38.803 --> 00:03:39.442
I'm sorry.

I haven't played in ages.

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:54.243
What brings you out today, Haoming?

00:04:55.202 --> 00:04:57.563
I mainly wanted to update you on work.

00:04:58.882 --> 00:04:59.923
Don't mention that.

00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:01.642
Our New District project

00:05:01.642 --> 00:05:02.723
is progressing smoothly.

00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:05.282
The planning permit
has been officially approved.

00:05:06.163 --> 00:05:07.163
With you overseeing it,

00:05:07.282 --> 00:05:08.762
I have no worries at all.

00:05:10.762 --> 00:05:11.322
Haoming,

00:05:13.123 --> 00:05:14.202
there's a personal matter

00:05:14.563 --> 00:05:16.003
that I'm hesitant to ask about.

00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:17.842
Go ahead.

00:05:18.522 --> 00:05:19.243
Lately,

00:05:19.483 --> 00:05:20.923
I've heard some rumors

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.202
about your wife, Xu Yan, resigning.

00:05:24.043 --> 00:05:25.043
What's going on?

00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:27.683
She's starting her own business.

00:05:31.603 --> 00:05:33.483
There are things you might not know.

00:05:34.043 --> 00:05:35.123
Even now,

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:37.522
Xu Yan regularly
visits my mother-in-law.

00:05:38.123 --> 00:05:39.762
Every time my mother-in-law sees her,

00:05:39.762 --> 00:05:41.603
she's overjoyed.

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:43.803
I always thought

00:05:44.003 --> 00:05:45.923
once we established cooperation,

00:05:46.762 --> 00:05:49.123
she'd stop putting effort into her.

00:05:50.762 --> 00:05:54.282
I didn't expect
she'd be truly remarkable.

00:05:56.202 --> 00:05:58.123
You two are well-matched.

00:05:58.683 --> 00:06:00.842
I can see that as family,

00:06:01.163 --> 00:06:02.563
she genuinely cares for you.

00:06:04.723 --> 00:06:05.723
Thank you.

00:06:06.483 --> 00:06:08.243
Forgive my bluntness.

00:06:28.762 --> 00:06:30.243
(You're a typical boss.)

00:06:30.683 --> 00:06:32.003
Your expression of emotions

00:06:32.003 --> 00:06:33.040
has become transactional.

00:06:33.842 --> 00:06:34.962
I just want to give you

00:06:35.642 --> 00:06:36.842
the life you want.

00:06:37.402 --> 00:06:38.923
You are all I want.

00:06:40.522 --> 00:06:42.723
Convincing them wasn't easy.

00:06:43.243 --> 00:06:45.363
Luckily, I have a capable wife.

00:06:45.842 --> 00:06:47.202
This deal couldn't have been done

00:06:47.603 --> 00:06:48.522
without you.

00:06:49.723 --> 00:06:50.402
Are you okay?

00:07:09.522 --> 00:07:11.842
Hello?

00:07:12.163 --> 00:07:12.522
Hello.

00:07:12.522 --> 00:07:14.202
I called earlier.

00:07:14.202 --> 00:07:15.202
It's over half an hour.

00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:16.642
When will you come to fix the pipe?

00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:18.762
Soon. I've sent someone.

00:07:19.762 --> 00:07:21.363
Give me a specific time.

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:23.803
I'll hurry.

00:07:42.803 --> 00:07:43.642
So fast?

00:07:45.402 --> 00:07:47.282
Coming. Please...

00:07:52.043 --> 00:07:53.363
Wh-Why are you here?

00:07:54.402 --> 00:07:54.962
I...

00:07:56.762 --> 00:07:57.723
What are you...

00:08:00.442 --> 00:08:02.803
Maybe we should wait for maintenance.

00:08:03.723 --> 00:08:04.603
Take a break.

00:08:04.842 --> 00:08:06.442
Done. Try it now.

00:08:07.003 --> 00:08:07.762
Turn on the tap.

00:08:08.762 --> 00:08:09.282
Well?

00:08:09.882 --> 00:08:11.123
Turn it off! Turn it off now!

00:08:12.163 --> 00:08:13.363
Hand me that tape.

00:08:14.003 --> 00:08:15.043
T-Tape?

00:08:15.123 --> 00:08:16.282
Use paper towels to wipe it.

00:08:17.243 --> 00:08:17.842
How much?

00:08:18.282 --> 00:08:19.202
It's okay. I can do it.

00:08:19.603 --> 00:08:20.043
Okay.

00:08:20.163 --> 00:08:20.962
Thanks.

00:08:21.003 --> 00:08:21.642
No problem.

00:08:23.723 --> 00:08:24.163
Done.

00:08:24.962 --> 00:08:25.683
Are you sure?

00:08:26.322 --> 00:08:27.003
Step back a bit.

00:08:27.003 --> 00:08:28.522
I'm turning the water on. Be careful.

00:08:34.162 --> 00:08:34.843
Fixed, right?

00:08:35.922 --> 00:08:37.003
Thank you.

00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:38.243
Thank you.

00:08:39.042 --> 00:08:39.843
It was nothing.

00:08:40.802 --> 00:08:41.882
You should go wash up now.

00:08:41.922 --> 00:08:42.603
Just go.

00:08:42.603 --> 00:08:43.723
I already washed down there.

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:45.282
Then dry yourself off.

00:08:45.282 --> 00:08:45.642
Okay.

00:08:45.682 --> 00:08:46.603
I made you some tea.

00:08:46.642 --> 00:08:48.522
Come out and drink some warm tea first.

00:08:50.282 --> 00:08:51.203
Have a seat.

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:55.723
Here. Drink some tea.

00:08:55.882 --> 00:08:56.443
Thank you.

00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:01.123
Here.

00:09:03.723 --> 00:09:04.243
Thanks.

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:05.723
Don't mention it.

00:09:06.682 --> 00:09:08.682
You moved out without telling anyone.

00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:10.963
I asked your assistant to find out.

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:13.042
You have your sister,

00:09:13.616 --> 00:09:15.344
and me, your fellow townsman
and classmate.

00:09:15.562 --> 00:09:17.042
You can share your troubles with us.

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:19.083
We can help you find solutions.

00:09:20.162 --> 00:09:21.762
Be it work or personal issues.

00:09:22.522 --> 00:09:23.922
They are all minor issues.

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:24.922
I can handle them.

00:09:26.123 --> 00:09:28.042
Besides, everyone has
their own life path.

00:09:28.042 --> 00:09:29.162
I can't trouble you guys

00:09:29.162 --> 00:09:30.203
with every little thing.

00:09:32.123 --> 00:09:33.443
You're always so formal with me.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.243
How's the job hunt going?

00:09:39.522 --> 00:09:40.123
Any progress?

00:09:40.843 --> 00:09:42.123
I haven't started looking yet.

00:09:44.162 --> 00:09:44.723
Right.

00:09:45.483 --> 00:09:46.922
Jobs are scarce these days.

00:09:47.762 --> 00:09:48.922
But don't stress about it.

00:09:49.603 --> 00:09:52.603
Take this time to relax
and get organized.

00:10:00.003 --> 00:10:01.762
When we have time, your sister and I

00:10:02.762 --> 00:10:04.243
will cook you some home-style dishes.

00:10:05.762 --> 00:10:08.243
Eating instant noodles
and frozen dumplings every day

00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:09.762
isn't healthy.

00:10:11.603 --> 00:10:15.083
You've been busy in the hospital,

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.882
and you need to take care of Qiao Lin.

00:10:18.402 --> 00:10:20.003
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:22.042
I can handle anything. Really.

00:10:24.802 --> 00:10:25.402
Xu Yan,

00:10:27.642 --> 00:10:30.843
actually, I came today
because I wanted to...

00:10:30.843 --> 00:10:31.402
Yiming,

00:10:34.963 --> 00:10:36.843
I know you used to like me.

00:10:37.083 --> 00:10:38.802
But in my heart, I've always seen you

00:10:38.802 --> 00:10:40.682
as a fellow townsman and classmate.

00:10:41.243 --> 00:10:42.483
Nothing more. Okay?

00:10:42.723 --> 00:10:43.762
You're misunderstanding.

00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:46.483
Yes.

00:10:47.203 --> 00:10:48.323
I had feelings for you.

00:10:48.963 --> 00:10:50.123
And I confessed to you.

00:10:50.922 --> 00:10:52.323
It's my most innocent

00:10:52.323 --> 00:10:53.642
and beautiful memory from 18.

00:10:54.003 --> 00:10:55.282
Besides, it's been so long now.

00:10:56.243 --> 00:10:57.083
I've moved on.

00:10:58.323 --> 00:11:00.042
No matter what happens,

00:11:00.402 --> 00:11:01.123
if you're in need,

00:11:01.802 --> 00:11:02.522
I'll help you,

00:11:02.522 --> 00:11:03.282
no reason needed.

00:11:03.802 --> 00:11:06.083
Just like today, I'm just here
to check on you.

00:11:06.843 --> 00:11:08.042
So don't feel burdened.

00:11:08.882 --> 00:11:09.882
If you need anything,

00:11:10.402 --> 00:11:12.042
just tell me or your sister.

00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:12.922
It's the same.

00:11:14.603 --> 00:11:15.963
After all, your sister and I...

00:11:21.083 --> 00:11:22.203
Qiao Lin...

00:11:24.922 --> 00:11:27.323
Qiao Lin is actually wonderful.

00:11:31.402 --> 00:11:32.363
Behave well.

00:11:34.003 --> 00:11:35.963
I'll dry my clothes and leave now.

00:11:36.443 --> 00:11:37.042
Well,

00:11:37.042 --> 00:11:38.363
the hairdryer's in the bathroom.

00:12:04.243 --> 00:12:04.723
What...

00:12:06.123 --> 00:12:06.963
What brings you here?

00:12:08.843 --> 00:12:10.123
Divorce Supplementary Agreement.

00:12:10.562 --> 00:12:11.243
(Divorce Supplementary Agreement)
Here you are.

00:12:14.723 --> 00:12:15.443
Got it.

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:18.723
I'll have it delivered after signing.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.282
Since I'm free today,

00:12:28.203 --> 00:12:29.802
let's go through each clause.

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:38.922
- You have a visitor?
- Yes.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:41.402
May I start?

00:12:43.922 --> 00:12:44.922
Sure.

00:12:48.162 --> 00:12:49.162
Let's review each clause.

00:12:49.522 --> 00:12:50.642
Any additions you want?

00:12:51.682 --> 00:12:52.363
No rush.

00:12:53.123 --> 00:12:53.802
Take the time.

00:13:02.443 --> 00:13:03.562
Xu Yan, I'm done drying.

00:13:10.003 --> 00:13:10.882
And this is?

00:13:11.963 --> 00:13:13.723
My high school classmate, Yu Yiming.

00:13:19.762 --> 00:13:20.483
Shen Haoming.

00:13:22.203 --> 00:13:23.243
So he's your...

00:13:23.603 --> 00:13:24.162
Husband.

00:13:25.642 --> 00:13:26.162
Hello.

00:13:27.203 --> 00:13:27.723
Hello.

00:13:28.802 --> 00:13:29.922
I'll leave you two alone.

00:13:30.003 --> 00:13:31.402
I'll head back now.

00:13:31.802 --> 00:13:32.922
- I'll walk you out.
- No need.

00:13:34.282 --> 00:13:34.843
Thanks.

00:13:35.083 --> 00:13:35.642
My pleasure.

00:13:35.723 --> 00:13:36.162
Take care.

00:13:37.203 --> 00:13:38.203
Thanks, Yiming.

00:13:38.402 --> 00:13:38.882
Anytime.

00:13:44.682 --> 00:13:45.562
Shall we start?

00:13:46.922 --> 00:13:49.042
There's a clause
in the supplementary agreement:

00:13:49.723 --> 00:13:51.042
even if we do divorce,

00:13:51.443 --> 00:13:52.723
you need my approval

00:13:53.162 --> 00:13:54.762
before making any public announcements.

00:13:55.922 --> 00:13:57.402
Considering my company's reputation,

00:13:57.642 --> 00:13:59.562
mind your words and actions.

00:14:02.443 --> 00:14:04.123
Have I been inappropriate?

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:05.363
No.

00:14:06.162 --> 00:14:07.483
I know Yu Yiming

00:14:07.682 --> 00:14:09.003
is your sister's boyfriend.

00:14:15.882 --> 00:14:17.323
You shouldn't be in business.

00:14:18.443 --> 00:14:20.003
You should be a spy.

00:14:21.123 --> 00:14:22.562
Just friendly advice.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.363
Let me remind you too:

00:14:25.642 --> 00:14:28.882
Tomorrow's the 8th.
See you at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

00:14:29.042 --> 00:14:29.562
Fine.

00:14:31.762 --> 00:14:32.723
And I'll remind you:

00:14:33.882 --> 00:14:34.723
Sign this.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.352
(Divorce Registration
Acceptance Receipt)

00:14:40.762 --> 00:14:42.083
Divorce cooling-off period?

00:14:42.243 --> 00:14:43.162
(Marriage Registration Office)
You don't know?

00:14:43.243 --> 00:14:44.162
Agreement divorces now

00:14:44.162 --> 00:14:45.402
have a cooling-off period.

00:14:45.603 --> 00:14:46.562
As the name suggests,

00:14:46.562 --> 00:14:47.603
it gives couples time

00:14:47.642 --> 00:14:50.003
to reconsider it
and avoid rash decisions.

00:14:50.483 --> 00:14:51.723
Your divorce application

00:14:51.723 --> 00:14:52.762
will be processed first.

00:14:53.042 --> 00:14:54.562
Your cooling-off period lasts a month.

00:14:54.723 --> 00:14:55.402
During this time,

00:14:55.522 --> 00:14:57.042
if you cancel the divorce,

00:14:57.483 --> 00:14:58.483
don't come back.

00:14:58.522 --> 00:14:59.922
The application will be revoked.

00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:01.882
If you still can't reconcile,

00:15:01.922 --> 00:15:02.723
return then.

00:15:03.642 --> 00:15:04.323
Next couple.

00:15:23.603 --> 00:15:24.282
I'm done.

00:15:24.483 --> 00:15:25.522
This tastes awful.

00:15:27.083 --> 00:15:28.723
What's wrong? Why the sudden temper?

00:15:29.323 --> 00:15:32.162
Aren't these all your usual favorites?

00:15:32.443 --> 00:15:34.483
I want my sis-in-law's
Longjing Tea Shrimp.

00:15:37.363 --> 00:15:38.448
She's starting a business

00:15:38.642 --> 00:15:39.802
and works long hours daily.

00:15:40.243 --> 00:15:41.483
She can't cook for you.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.522
Can't she live here
while building her business?

00:15:45.203 --> 00:15:46.682
You must have upset her

00:15:46.682 --> 00:15:47.562
and won't admit it.

00:15:47.642 --> 00:15:48.443
Haochen.

00:15:51.443 --> 00:15:52.963
Mind your tone with your brother.

00:16:03.243 --> 00:16:04.363
What's wrong now?

00:16:05.843 --> 00:16:06.642
Have more fish.

00:16:06.922 --> 00:16:08.762
You love steamed fish, don't you?

00:16:10.323 --> 00:16:11.323
My fault.

00:16:11.483 --> 00:16:13.483
Ms. Yu prefers Yan's steamed fish.

00:16:13.603 --> 00:16:15.443
I never get the technique right.

00:16:15.562 --> 00:16:16.642
The flavor's not the same.

00:16:17.483 --> 00:16:18.483
It's fine. It's good.

00:17:34.442 --> 00:17:39.120
(Sunshine, Coolest Rider, Horseback Day)

00:17:47.003 --> 00:17:48.203
(People say)

00:17:49.842 --> 00:17:53.443
a happy childhood
can heal you for a lifetime.

00:17:55.883 --> 00:17:57.042
But an unhappy one

00:18:00.322 --> 00:18:01.683
takes a lifetime to heal.

00:18:06.963 --> 00:18:08.042
That's why I believe

00:18:09.122 --> 00:18:10.963
no material comforts

00:18:12.322 --> 00:18:14.723
can replace family love and presence.

00:18:16.643 --> 00:18:17.963
Haochen's too young.

00:18:20.122 --> 00:18:22.883
Can't we ask your parents to reconsider?

00:18:32.243 --> 00:18:32.963
(Xu Yan's Resume)
Gezi,

00:18:34.362 --> 00:18:36.362
I'm willing to reduce my salary by 20%,

00:18:36.432 --> 00:18:38.128
the probation period
can be negotiated too,

00:18:38.322 --> 00:18:40.368
and I'll follow your scheduling
for show timeslots.

00:18:40.883 --> 00:18:42.122
Just give me a chance,

00:18:42.362 --> 00:18:44.282
and I'll prove myself worthy.

00:18:44.762 --> 00:18:47.042
Xu, I'm truly sorry,

00:18:47.483 --> 00:18:49.322
but we don't have
suitable jobs for you now.

00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:51.802
You know that

00:18:51.883 --> 00:18:53.203
the positions are all occupied.

00:18:53.483 --> 00:18:55.203
Unless someone quits,
takes medical leave,

00:18:55.203 --> 00:18:56.443
or has other emergencies,

00:18:56.483 --> 00:18:58.762
our lead hosts
could stay until retirement.

00:18:59.122 --> 00:19:01.602
Once you are out of the structure,

00:19:03.243 --> 00:19:04.762
it's hard to get another opportunity.

00:19:09.122 --> 00:19:09.923
Thank you.

00:19:21.643 --> 00:19:22.842
Where's Qu?

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:24.282
Alright.

00:19:24.602 --> 00:19:25.403
Let's begin.

00:19:26.923 --> 00:19:29.522
Chapter 3, Article 6
of Jinda's Articles of Association

00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:30.762
regarding board election

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:32.522
states that to ensure validity,

00:19:32.802 --> 00:19:34.322
over 90% of board members

00:19:34.362 --> 00:19:35.802
must attend.

00:19:36.003 --> 00:19:38.802
Those absent will be
considered abstentions.

00:19:39.203 --> 00:19:41.163
We have 13 present members

00:19:41.322 --> 00:19:42.243
and 1 absence,

00:19:42.322 --> 00:19:43.403
meeting the requirements.

00:19:43.643 --> 00:19:44.562
The election is valid.

00:19:45.362 --> 00:19:47.282
Now we'll vote on Shen Haoming's

00:19:47.282 --> 00:19:50.082
admission to the board.

00:19:50.762 --> 00:19:52.883
Those in favor of him,
please raise hands.

00:20:01.243 --> 00:20:01.842
Six votes.

00:20:03.562 --> 00:20:04.403
Those who oppose,

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:05.602
please raise hands.

00:20:12.042 --> 00:20:12.522
Okay.

00:20:13.122 --> 00:20:14.923
With Qu's abstention,

00:20:15.082 --> 00:20:18.322
current votes are
six in favor and six against.

00:20:18.723 --> 00:20:19.403
Chairman,

00:20:20.003 --> 00:20:21.003
your vote is decisive.

00:20:32.443 --> 00:20:34.082
The chairman's family

00:20:34.362 --> 00:20:35.443
has been troubled lately.

00:20:36.243 --> 00:20:36.963
Oh?

00:20:37.443 --> 00:20:39.643
Shen Haoming's wife quit her job

00:20:40.403 --> 00:20:42.802
and moved out.

00:20:43.003 --> 00:20:45.643
Rumors say they're divorcing

00:20:45.802 --> 00:20:47.163
and dividing assets.

00:20:47.562 --> 00:20:50.082
I always knew
that guy's not an easy one.

00:20:50.362 --> 00:20:51.203
I heard

00:20:51.322 --> 00:20:53.562
he was wild in England,

00:20:54.243 --> 00:20:55.883
living a messy personal life

00:20:56.122 --> 00:20:58.003
surrounded by women.

00:20:59.042 --> 00:21:01.122
And he wants board membership?

00:21:02.163 --> 00:21:05.203
That board seat isn't meant for him.

00:21:06.602 --> 00:21:07.963
As you know,

00:21:08.362 --> 00:21:12.203
he's the heir backed by his father.

00:21:13.042 --> 00:21:14.243
What can we say?

00:21:14.522 --> 00:21:16.562
We built Jinda Group together

00:21:16.562 --> 00:21:17.762
for years.

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:20.042
We can't let his father dictate all.

00:21:20.322 --> 00:21:21.443
(Anyway, at the meeting,)

00:21:21.562 --> 00:21:22.403
(I'll object.)

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:25.163
I object.

00:21:26.443 --> 00:21:28.282
Seven against, six in favor.

00:21:31.562 --> 00:21:33.562
Shen Haoming fails to join the board.

00:21:34.842 --> 00:21:35.243
Alright.

00:21:35.362 --> 00:21:36.203
Meeting adjourned.

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:45.362
I thought we had an agreement.

00:21:45.683 --> 00:21:47.163
I'd resolve the company crisis

00:21:47.522 --> 00:21:48.923
and develop new projects

00:21:49.403 --> 00:21:50.723
for a board seat.

00:21:52.082 --> 00:21:52.522
Yes,

00:21:54.163 --> 00:21:56.042
but I reconsidered.

00:21:57.003 --> 00:21:57.762
You're unfit.

00:21:58.403 --> 00:21:59.122
Reasons?

00:21:59.883 --> 00:22:01.282
I question your self-control,

00:22:01.362 --> 00:22:03.802
decision-making skills, and maturity.

00:22:04.963 --> 00:22:06.282
Are you bringing that up again?

00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:07.483
Have a seat.

00:22:10.122 --> 00:22:10.923
Sit down.

00:22:15.243 --> 00:22:15.762
Haoming,

00:22:16.403 --> 00:22:17.163
you need to know

00:22:17.923 --> 00:22:19.602
that since childhood,

00:22:19.643 --> 00:22:20.562
you've always been

00:22:20.562 --> 00:22:21.562
a good kid in my eyes

00:22:21.562 --> 00:22:22.883
who excelled in studies.

00:22:23.003 --> 00:22:24.842
That's why I gave you freedom

00:22:25.322 --> 00:22:26.362
and space.

00:22:26.362 --> 00:22:27.403
I had you study abroad.

00:22:29.082 --> 00:22:29.802
At nineteen,

00:22:30.522 --> 00:22:32.403
life was just beginning.

00:22:32.403 --> 00:22:33.643
Dating was fine.

00:22:33.683 --> 00:22:35.122
You were free to date girls.

00:22:35.282 --> 00:22:36.883
Why did you insist on keeping that baby?

00:22:37.203 --> 00:22:38.643
Did you even listen

00:22:38.723 --> 00:22:40.122
to your mom and my advice?

00:22:40.522 --> 00:22:41.322
Did you consider

00:22:41.403 --> 00:22:42.802
what future that child would have?

00:22:43.042 --> 00:22:45.163
Did you consider your own future?

00:22:45.403 --> 00:22:46.203
Did you consider

00:22:46.362 --> 00:22:48.122
it could stain your reputation?

00:22:48.122 --> 00:22:49.723
I never saw Haochen's birth as a stain.

00:22:49.723 --> 00:22:50.602
How is it not?

00:22:54.163 --> 00:22:56.602
We've been covering this up
for you all along.

00:22:56.923 --> 00:22:58.042
If your rivals find out,

00:22:58.322 --> 00:23:00.042
if your competitors learn about this,

00:23:00.322 --> 00:23:01.483
they'll exploit it

00:23:01.643 --> 00:23:03.723
and destroy you. Understand?

00:23:04.602 --> 00:23:05.963
If they see you

00:23:06.483 --> 00:23:08.322
as a reckless playboy,

00:23:08.362 --> 00:23:11.082
irresponsible and impulsive,

00:23:12.082 --> 00:23:13.282
who'd trust you?

00:23:13.562 --> 00:23:14.683
Would the board

00:23:15.122 --> 00:23:16.403
or the shareholders believe you?

00:23:16.643 --> 00:23:17.362
Never.

00:23:17.683 --> 00:23:18.602
As for your marriage,

00:23:19.203 --> 00:23:21.443
we let you make the decision

00:23:22.042 --> 00:23:23.802
and choose your own wife.

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:25.562
But what did you do?

00:23:26.003 --> 00:23:27.762
You picked a fraud.

00:23:28.883 --> 00:23:30.483
Her background,

00:23:30.483 --> 00:23:31.923
education, life history,

00:23:31.923 --> 00:23:34.282
you knew everything about her,

00:23:34.643 --> 00:23:36.122
yet you hid the truth.

00:23:36.683 --> 00:23:37.883
You lied to us.

00:23:38.842 --> 00:23:40.723
I can't tolerate this.
Do you understand?

00:23:43.362 --> 00:23:44.802
Lying was my mistake.

00:23:46.602 --> 00:23:48.163
But between Xu Yan and me,

00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:50.322
our relationship was equal.

00:23:51.562 --> 00:23:53.003
I accepted everything about her.

00:23:53.003 --> 00:23:54.483
We wouldn't have divorced

00:23:54.483 --> 00:23:55.322
if she hadn't asked.

00:23:55.403 --> 00:23:57.562
She quit her news anchor career

00:23:57.762 --> 00:23:59.322
and caused quite a stir.

00:24:00.403 --> 00:24:01.443
No more excuses.

00:24:02.443 --> 00:24:03.403
Go to Cheng'an County.

00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:06.762
Handle the delayed project
at our branch there.

00:24:07.762 --> 00:24:08.963
Resolve it before you return.

00:24:16.762 --> 00:24:17.443
Mr. Shen,

00:24:18.602 --> 00:24:20.243
are you sure you don't want me with you?

00:24:22.122 --> 00:24:23.762
The email specified

00:24:24.602 --> 00:24:26.403
that only I will be transferred.

00:24:26.963 --> 00:24:29.282
Taking you violates company policy.

00:24:29.522 --> 00:24:31.602
But that branch is
in such a remote area.

00:24:32.082 --> 00:24:33.683
I worry about you going alone.

00:24:36.403 --> 00:24:37.443
You'll be more useful

00:24:37.842 --> 00:24:39.042
staying at the headquarters.

00:24:39.643 --> 00:24:40.883
If anything happens,

00:24:41.362 --> 00:24:42.403
keep me informed.

00:24:45.562 --> 00:24:46.122
I'm leaving.

00:24:46.122 --> 00:24:48.443
(Mailbox: Interview Rejected)

00:24:48.443 --> 00:24:50.163
If no positions open up...

00:24:52.003 --> 00:24:52.443
Alright.

00:24:53.443 --> 00:24:54.802
If new opportunities arise,

00:24:55.003 --> 00:24:56.842
please notify me.

00:24:58.403 --> 00:24:59.122
Okay, thanks.

00:25:11.114 --> 00:25:14.416
(Makeup Artist Liao's Call)

00:25:15.122 --> 00:25:15.963
Hello, Liao?

00:25:15.963 --> 00:25:16.643
Any news?

00:25:17.842 --> 00:25:18.643
Good news.

00:25:23.883 --> 00:25:26.082
What's wrong with you people?

00:25:27.122 --> 00:25:28.243
I told you to recruit hosts,

00:25:28.322 --> 00:25:29.282
but after all this time,

00:25:29.322 --> 00:25:30.883
you've found none.

00:25:31.522 --> 00:25:32.082
Mr. Qiu,

00:25:32.082 --> 00:25:33.243
you know our challenges here:

00:25:33.483 --> 00:25:35.163
other hosts complain about

00:25:35.163 --> 00:25:36.203
low profit sharing

00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:37.403
or our schedule demands...

00:25:37.403 --> 00:25:38.522
Alright, cut that.

00:25:38.842 --> 00:25:39.522
All nonsense.

00:25:40.403 --> 00:25:41.003
Mr. Qiu.

00:25:41.923 --> 00:25:43.122
This is Xu Yan.

00:25:43.522 --> 00:25:45.243
The hottest anchor

00:25:45.243 --> 00:25:46.483
I mentioned to you before.

00:25:47.203 --> 00:25:48.923
You've seen Family Feast, right?

00:25:49.243 --> 00:25:51.282
She even hosted financial news before.

00:25:57.842 --> 00:25:58.483
Glad to see you.

00:26:00.483 --> 00:26:01.562
Hello, Mr. Qiu.

00:26:02.762 --> 00:26:03.963
I'm terribly sorry

00:26:04.003 --> 00:26:05.802
for bringing you in
for the sudden audition.

00:26:05.883 --> 00:26:06.522
Not at all.

00:26:07.003 --> 00:26:08.282
Thank you for the opportunity.

00:26:08.483 --> 00:26:09.282
Thank you, Liao.

00:26:11.003 --> 00:26:11.802
You read the script?

00:26:12.163 --> 00:26:12.842
Yes.

00:26:13.883 --> 00:26:15.003
But, Mr. Qiu,

00:26:15.522 --> 00:26:17.282
I adjusted it

00:26:17.282 --> 00:26:18.403
based on my interpretation.

00:26:18.522 --> 00:26:19.522
Would that be acceptable?

00:26:19.723 --> 00:26:21.762
No need to check. It's excellent.

00:26:22.282 --> 00:26:23.483
Actually, every host

00:26:23.643 --> 00:26:25.042
needs their own distinctive style.

00:26:25.562 --> 00:26:26.762
Shall we do the audition now?

00:26:27.643 --> 00:26:28.282
No problem.

00:26:28.802 --> 00:26:30.322
Hello, audience.

00:26:30.683 --> 00:26:32.122
Welcome to the 618

00:26:32.362 --> 00:26:34.282
Comfort Home Textiles live stream.

00:26:35.802 --> 00:26:36.923
Comfort Home Textiles

00:26:37.163 --> 00:26:38.483
has earned worldwide fame

00:26:38.483 --> 00:26:39.963
for its experimental brand image

00:26:40.163 --> 00:26:41.802
and premium sleep quality,

00:26:42.203 --> 00:26:43.203
captivating consumers

00:26:43.203 --> 00:26:44.762
both domestically and internationally.

00:26:45.602 --> 00:26:46.883
To show our gratitude,

00:26:46.963 --> 00:26:49.003
we're offering exclusive deals

00:26:49.042 --> 00:26:50.243
on our premium products.

00:26:50.602 --> 00:26:53.203
This 100% cotton bedding set

00:26:53.203 --> 00:26:54.362
in front of me

00:26:54.723 --> 00:26:56.483
has a 50% off discount

00:26:56.602 --> 00:26:58.282
in today's live stream.

00:26:58.802 --> 00:27:01.003
Bring premium comfort
to your bedroom tonight.

00:27:01.362 --> 00:27:01.842
Stop.

00:27:05.602 --> 00:27:06.362
Ms. Xu,

00:27:06.683 --> 00:27:08.723
are you reporting news
or selling products?

00:27:09.203 --> 00:27:10.762
This won't work.

00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:12.163
To keep viewers engaged,

00:27:12.282 --> 00:27:13.643
you need vocal projection.

00:27:13.923 --> 00:27:15.643
You need explosive energy in your words

00:27:15.842 --> 00:27:17.362
and make the viewers feel urgent,

00:27:17.643 --> 00:27:18.762
like they'll miss out.

00:27:19.203 --> 00:27:20.963
Create that vibe that not buying now

00:27:20.963 --> 00:27:22.443
means losing a fortune.

00:27:22.443 --> 00:27:22.923
Got it?

00:27:24.762 --> 00:27:26.003
Got it, Mr. Qiu.

00:27:26.322 --> 00:27:27.602
But I believe

00:27:27.602 --> 00:27:29.522
my natural strength lies in

00:27:30.723 --> 00:27:32.203
a more composed hosting style.

00:27:32.562 --> 00:27:33.282
Like...

00:27:35.443 --> 00:27:37.562
Professor Wu's lecturing style

00:27:37.762 --> 00:27:40.243
or Dr. Chen's lab presentations.

00:27:40.602 --> 00:27:42.282
That hosting approach

00:27:42.562 --> 00:27:43.923
might suit me better.

00:27:44.602 --> 00:27:45.082
True,

00:27:45.403 --> 00:27:46.362
those examples you gave

00:27:46.362 --> 00:27:48.282
are established star hosts.

00:27:48.643 --> 00:27:50.003
You're still new to this.

00:27:50.802 --> 00:27:51.923
If you keep this up,

00:27:52.042 --> 00:27:55.243
we'll be lucky to get twenty viewers.

00:27:56.003 --> 00:27:56.923
I'm sorry.

00:27:58.203 --> 00:27:59.122
Alright, I know

00:27:59.122 --> 00:28:00.322
you used to be a news anchor.

00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:03.163
This is indeed new to you.

00:28:03.522 --> 00:28:04.203
Hard to adapt.

00:28:04.443 --> 00:28:04.923
Well...

00:28:09.483 --> 00:28:10.522
I'll teach you how.

00:28:13.883 --> 00:28:14.483
Start!

00:28:14.963 --> 00:28:16.122
Break the price floor.

00:28:23.883 --> 00:28:25.042
Break the price floor.

00:28:26.042 --> 00:28:27.042
There you go. Try harder.

00:28:27.163 --> 00:28:27.602
Again.

00:28:27.963 --> 00:28:29.282
Break the price floor!

00:28:30.723 --> 00:28:31.923
Break the price floor!

00:28:32.042 --> 00:28:33.163
Yes, here you go.

00:28:33.163 --> 00:28:33.883
Repeat after me.

00:28:34.042 --> 00:28:36.003
Don't talk like a news anchor!

00:28:37.243 --> 00:28:38.842
Don't talk like a news anchor!

00:28:39.082 --> 00:28:40.522
Open up a new world!

00:28:41.362 --> 00:28:42.762
Open up a new world!

00:28:43.163 --> 00:28:44.522
Yes! Maintain that energy.

00:28:44.643 --> 00:28:45.522
Follow your script.

00:28:45.562 --> 00:28:46.362
Come on.

00:28:46.923 --> 00:28:48.042
No 599.

00:28:48.522 --> 00:28:49.643
No 499.

00:28:49.883 --> 00:28:51.082
No 299!

00:28:55.842 --> 00:28:56.883
Sorry, I need a moment.

00:28:58.483 --> 00:28:59.282
Alright.

00:29:00.163 --> 00:29:00.762
Never mind.

00:29:00.762 --> 00:29:02.042
I can try again. I'm sorry.

00:29:02.562 --> 00:29:03.362
Well, listen.

00:29:03.723 --> 00:29:05.443
You better sit out
tonight's live stream.

00:29:06.362 --> 00:29:08.923
Go back and practice more

00:29:09.203 --> 00:29:10.883
what I taught you.

00:29:11.963 --> 00:29:12.923
- Well, you...
- Here!

00:29:13.163 --> 00:29:14.522
I'll cover tonight's live stream.

00:29:14.683 --> 00:29:16.403
- Okay.
- Okay! Mr. Qiu, go!

00:29:43.042 --> 00:29:45.003
Welcome, Mr. Shen.

00:29:46.243 --> 00:29:48.963
Thank you for picking me up.
Appreciate the effort.

00:29:49.042 --> 00:29:50.122
Our pleasure.

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:51.042
Luggage!

00:29:52.203 --> 00:29:53.802
Mr. Shen, let me show you around.

00:29:53.802 --> 00:29:54.203
Come on.

00:29:57.226 --> 00:29:58.683
(General Manager's Office)

00:29:58.683 --> 00:29:59.243
Mr. Shen.

00:29:59.842 --> 00:30:00.963
This will be your office.

00:30:03.522 --> 00:30:04.842
Hongyun is the smallest branch

00:30:04.842 --> 00:30:05.802
under Jinda Group.

00:30:06.643 --> 00:30:07.963
Our resources here are limited.

00:30:08.163 --> 00:30:09.322
Bear the humble facilities.

00:30:09.683 --> 00:30:11.122
Mr. Shen, hope you don't mind.

00:30:13.643 --> 00:30:14.602
Normally,

00:30:14.842 --> 00:30:15.762
you'd stay in a hotel.

00:30:16.883 --> 00:30:18.723
But our budget can't cover that expense.

00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:20.443
Please stay here for now.

00:30:20.963 --> 00:30:21.883
It's a bit cramped,

00:30:22.163 --> 00:30:24.842
but only managers can enjoy this.

00:30:26.082 --> 00:30:28.243
But the restroom is in the yard.

00:30:31.082 --> 00:30:31.762
Mr. Zhang.

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:33.322
Please send me

00:30:33.403 --> 00:30:34.683
all the related files.

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:39.443
Don't you want to rest?

00:30:39.643 --> 00:30:40.562
Straight into work now?

00:30:42.562 --> 00:30:43.522
When is the earliest

00:30:43.522 --> 00:30:44.602
you can send them to me?

00:30:46.683 --> 00:30:48.243
They're all here. I've prepared them.

00:31:00.003 --> 00:31:02.282
We've already reported
the issues to headquarters.

00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:02.923
Mr. Shen.

00:31:03.163 --> 00:31:04.602
Let me brief you again.

00:31:04.842 --> 00:31:05.683
Here's the thing.

00:31:06.322 --> 00:31:07.322
Project delay

00:31:07.683 --> 00:31:09.762
is due to material
and labor cost increases.

00:31:10.282 --> 00:31:12.362
Mr. Wu from Anqiang Construction.

00:31:12.483 --> 00:31:13.122
I think

00:31:13.443 --> 00:31:14.704
he thought profits were slim,

00:31:14.704 --> 00:31:17.842
so secretly borrowed money
claiming it was for project funding.

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:19.683
Then he took the money and fled.

00:31:20.203 --> 00:31:21.122
We called the police.

00:31:21.163 --> 00:31:22.322
But in a situation like this,

00:31:22.562 --> 00:31:25.602
even if we catch him,
might still not recover the money.

00:31:26.602 --> 00:31:28.282
What's your alternative plan?

00:31:28.842 --> 00:31:31.042
I've activated the emergency fund

00:31:31.122 --> 00:31:32.362
to maintain daily operations.

00:31:32.562 --> 00:31:35.562
And I've applied for budget adjustment.

00:31:36.403 --> 00:31:37.602
If construction halts,

00:31:37.602 --> 00:31:38.322
fails to deliver,

00:31:38.562 --> 00:31:40.203
it would cause greater losses for us.

00:31:43.282 --> 00:31:44.883
So Mr. Shen,

00:31:46.003 --> 00:31:48.203
when can we get this budget?

00:31:51.203 --> 00:31:53.723
Only after I verify this.

00:31:55.203 --> 00:31:56.203
You'd better hurry then.

00:31:56.483 --> 00:31:57.883
The emergency fund can't last long.

00:32:03.003 --> 00:32:03.963
The inspection reports,

00:32:05.562 --> 00:32:06.384
construction logs,

00:32:09.243 --> 00:32:10.683
and building blueprints

00:32:11.042 --> 00:32:12.562
are all mixed together?

00:32:13.163 --> 00:32:14.042
No categorization?

00:32:14.483 --> 00:32:16.403
We're broke, Mr. Shen.

00:32:16.602 --> 00:32:18.443
We can barely keep
the construction team.

00:32:18.562 --> 00:32:20.243
I can't even afford a secretary

00:32:20.243 --> 00:32:23.082
or an assistant for you.

00:32:24.082 --> 00:32:26.282
Just let me know

00:32:26.282 --> 00:32:27.443
if you need anything.

00:32:27.522 --> 00:32:29.243
I'm mostly onsite daily,

00:32:29.243 --> 00:32:31.762
but I'll help when possible.

00:32:34.003 --> 00:32:35.243
Thank you.

00:32:36.602 --> 00:32:37.122
Mr. Zhang.

00:32:37.643 --> 00:32:38.602
I think we should host

00:32:38.602 --> 00:32:40.003
a banquet tonight

00:32:40.322 --> 00:32:42.483
to properly welcome Mr. Shen.

00:32:42.923 --> 00:32:43.883
No need.

00:32:44.683 --> 00:32:45.643
Trying to curry favor?

00:32:46.322 --> 00:32:46.842
You?

00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:48.403
I...

00:32:48.883 --> 00:32:50.282
I'm not fit for that.

00:32:51.403 --> 00:32:53.322
Li, I've told you many times

00:32:53.443 --> 00:32:54.483
(Staff Cafeteria)
not to waste efforts.

00:32:56.723 --> 00:32:57.802
I've figured it out.

00:32:59.403 --> 00:33:01.483
Chairman Shen didn't even
let him into the board.

00:33:02.163 --> 00:33:03.362
He's his biological son!

00:33:03.602 --> 00:33:04.403
How ruthless!

00:33:05.203 --> 00:33:07.483
He came back from abroad,

00:33:07.483 --> 00:33:08.562
but kept getting sidelined.

00:33:09.522 --> 00:33:10.802
Vice President sounds fancy,

00:33:11.163 --> 00:33:12.762
but it's just an empty title.

00:33:12.923 --> 00:33:15.122
Think about it.
They transferred him here

00:33:15.322 --> 00:33:16.723
without funding or manpower.

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:18.003
For what?

00:33:18.443 --> 00:33:19.522
Enjoying his life here?

00:33:20.282 --> 00:33:21.963
Obviously, he's been discarded,

00:33:22.403 --> 00:33:22.963
abandoned.

00:33:23.762 --> 00:33:24.923
What if he notices something?

00:33:24.923 --> 00:33:25.883
What if?

00:33:25.923 --> 00:33:26.923
Notice what?

00:33:32.362 --> 00:33:33.403
Look at him.

00:33:34.042 --> 00:33:35.762
Does he know
construction site intricacies?

00:33:36.082 --> 00:33:36.802
Even I don't know.

00:33:38.003 --> 00:33:42.322
Plus, even I couldn't stand
such facilities and office setup.

00:33:42.322 --> 00:33:43.282
How long can he hold on?

00:33:43.362 --> 00:33:44.643
He'll leave soon.

Hi everyone! I'm the host, Xu Yan.

00:35:01.522 --> 00:35:03.242
Today I'm recommending

00:35:03.403 --> 00:35:05.883
bedding from a national brand.

00:35:05.963 --> 00:35:07.242
Backstage, pass me...

00:35:07.323 --> 00:35:08.403

00:35:08.483 --> 00:35:09.323
Thanks.

Welcome to Xu Yan's live stream!

00:37:25.602 --> 00:37:27.363
Today I'm recommending

00:37:27.363 --> 00:37:28.803
a hot item that's popular

00:37:28.803 --> 00:37:29.722

00:37:30.722 --> 00:37:31.602
it would sell out!

00:37:31.602 --> 00:37:31.963
Right.

00:37:31.963 --> 00:37:33.483
It's the national brand bedding set.

00:37:33.682 --> 00:37:36.923
We are bringing you the item
from the factory today!

00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:37.963
We've even invited

00:37:37.963 --> 00:37:39.042
the manufacturer, Mr. Wang!

00:37:39.283 --> 00:37:40.242
Mr. Wang, please.

00:37:40.722 --> 00:37:41.642
Please tell everyone

00:37:41.642 --> 00:37:42.722
what offers you'll provide.

00:37:42.763 --> 00:37:43.483
It's my first time

00:37:43.483 --> 00:37:44.722
in Ms. Xu's live stream,

00:37:44.763 --> 00:37:46.042
so I'll give all of you

00:37:46.042 --> 00:37:46.963
the lowest prices!

00:37:47.162 --> 00:37:48.162
The lowest prices!

00:37:48.602 --> 00:37:50.363
Here's the quality inspection report?

00:37:50.363 --> 00:37:51.443
Inspection report. Right.

00:37:51.443 --> 00:37:52.522
Let me show you!

00:37:52.763 --> 00:37:54.323
All our products

00:37:54.403 --> 00:37:55.323
passed the inspection.

00:37:55.323 --> 00:37:55.763
Exactly.

00:37:55.803 --> 00:37:57.162
So the quality is guaranteed!

00:37:57.242 --> 00:37:57.843
And...

00:37:58.003 --> 00:37:59.443
This bedding set

00:37:59.642 --> 00:38:01.162
is exclusive to

00:38:01.162 --> 00:38:02.082
- five-star hotels!
- Yes!

00:38:02.082 --> 00:38:03.003
It achieves

00:38:03.162 --> 00:38:04.363
waterproof, oil-resistant,

00:38:04.562 --> 00:38:05.522
and super durable!

00:38:05.642 --> 00:38:06.602
Super durable!

00:38:06.843 --> 00:38:07.722
As Mr. Wang mentioned,

00:38:07.722 --> 00:38:08.562
it's super durable!

00:38:08.763 --> 00:38:09.963
But how durable exactly?

00:38:10.122 --> 00:38:12.242
I believe you want to know, right?

00:38:12.242 --> 00:38:12.682
Right.

00:38:12.803 --> 00:38:15.082
Today, right here,

00:38:15.122 --> 00:38:16.763
let's test it!

00:38:16.763 --> 00:38:17.122
Okay?

00:38:17.122 --> 00:38:17.443
Okay!

00:38:17.443 --> 00:38:19.122
Alright, get me a steel wool!

00:38:19.122 --> 00:38:20.722
- Here you go.
- Got it. Thanks.

00:38:21.363 --> 00:38:22.403
We'll use this steel wool.

00:38:22.522 --> 00:38:24.803
It's a real steel wool, see?

00:38:24.883 --> 00:38:26.162
Let's try scraping it.

00:38:26.323 --> 00:38:26.843
Look.

00:38:27.843 --> 00:38:30.003
How durable it is!

00:38:30.003 --> 00:38:31.283
- Look!
- Super durable!

00:38:31.843 --> 00:38:33.082
Camera crew,

00:38:33.122 --> 00:38:34.522
please get a close-up!

00:38:35.122 --> 00:38:37.763
See? No damage at all.

00:38:37.763 --> 00:38:39.323
Quality speaks for itself.

00:38:39.363 --> 00:38:41.682
For such a five-star product,

00:38:41.963 --> 00:38:44.122
our regular price is...

00:38:44.443 --> 00:38:47.323
1,999!

00:38:47.602 --> 00:38:49.883
But today we're breaking
the price floor!

00:38:49.883 --> 00:38:50.602
How much?

00:38:50.883 --> 00:38:53.082
599, okay?

00:38:53.082 --> 00:38:54.803
- Not the price we agreed.
- Mr. Wang, today,

00:38:54.803 --> 00:38:56.323
we must offer this price!

00:38:56.363 --> 00:38:59.283
It's special for all our viewers!

00:38:59.283 --> 00:38:59.642
Exactly!

00:38:59.642 --> 00:38:59.963
Right?

00:38:59.963 --> 00:39:00.323
Exactly.

00:39:00.323 --> 00:39:01.363
Backstage team, listen up!

00:39:01.443 --> 00:39:03.522
- Attach the link!
- Only 200 sets!

00:39:03.562 --> 00:39:05.202
- 200 sets! Buy them!
- We are...

00:39:05.202 --> 00:39:06.722
Three, two, one.

00:39:06.883 --> 00:39:07.803
Attach the link!

00:39:09.122 --> 00:39:10.682
Don't worry.

00:39:10.963 --> 00:39:12.522
The 200 lucky viewers

00:39:12.682 --> 00:39:15.883
will enjoy the 7-day
no-reason return policy.

00:39:16.082 --> 00:39:17.122
Even if you don't like it,

00:39:17.122 --> 00:39:18.562
contact the customer service...

00:39:18.642 --> 00:39:19.923
Stop!

00:39:22.003 --> 00:39:22.682
Xu Yan,

00:39:23.122 --> 00:39:24.763
is this how you plan to work later?

00:39:28.722 --> 00:39:30.122
Any problem, Mr. Qiu?

00:39:30.483 --> 00:39:32.682
You can't pitch products like this!

00:39:33.042 --> 00:39:34.082
If you don't like it,

00:39:34.122 --> 00:39:36.082
you can return within 7 days?

00:39:36.642 --> 00:39:37.242
Fine.

00:39:37.642 --> 00:39:38.562
They come in and buy,

00:39:38.602 --> 00:39:39.443
and then return it.

00:39:39.883 --> 00:39:41.283
We'll get a bunch of return orders.

00:39:42.082 --> 00:39:43.202
How to anti-refund?

00:39:44.403 --> 00:39:46.202
And what's our feature today?

00:39:46.483 --> 00:39:47.202
Factory.

00:39:48.483 --> 00:39:49.122
Factory.

00:39:49.122 --> 00:39:50.242
Factory, right?

00:39:50.443 --> 00:39:51.602
I've told you in this case,

00:39:51.763 --> 00:39:53.963
we should emphasize materials.

00:39:54.162 --> 00:39:55.682
The manufacturer is right here.

00:39:56.522 --> 00:39:57.522
You should highlight

00:39:57.522 --> 00:39:59.763
how exceptional the fabric quality it is

00:39:59.803 --> 00:40:01.522
and mention the factory scale.

00:40:02.003 --> 00:40:03.602
Why didn't you mention any of these?

00:40:08.283 --> 00:40:11.122
I-I thought we were
only following the script.

00:40:11.162 --> 00:40:12.522
But I'll definitely add

00:40:12.522 --> 00:40:14.202
more supplementary content later.

00:40:14.443 --> 00:40:15.803
The scripts are rigid,

00:40:16.082 --> 00:40:17.328
but we are flexible.

00:40:18.128 --> 00:40:18.642
Right?

00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:20.042
You're a host.

00:40:20.522 --> 00:40:22.162
I gave you the manual.

00:40:22.363 --> 00:40:24.722
The rhetoric contains
only three categories.

00:40:25.202 --> 00:40:27.483
Product shaping, pricing,
and product pitching.

00:40:28.003 --> 00:40:29.082
What did you say?

00:40:29.522 --> 00:40:30.602
All selling points.

00:40:31.403 --> 00:40:33.763
You should mix selling points
in product pitching.

00:40:34.323 --> 00:40:35.763
Use selling points to answer

00:40:35.763 --> 00:40:37.283
why they should buy it

00:40:38.682 --> 00:40:40.003
and why to buy it today.

00:40:40.283 --> 00:40:41.602
What about the perks?

00:40:42.042 --> 00:40:44.162
Use perks to pitch the product.

00:40:44.522 --> 00:40:45.443
Use the feature.

00:40:45.602 --> 00:40:46.483
Use the endorsement.

00:40:46.562 --> 00:40:47.483
Use the brand.

00:40:47.483 --> 00:40:48.368
You missed them all!

00:40:51.562 --> 00:40:52.803
Sorry, Mr. Qiu.

00:40:54.003 --> 00:40:54.562
I...

00:40:55.042 --> 00:40:55.403
Enough.

00:40:55.403 --> 00:40:56.283
No more excuses.

00:40:56.602 --> 00:40:57.682
Starting today,

00:40:58.082 --> 00:41:00.003
you'll assist Sun as co-host.

00:41:00.483 --> 00:41:01.162
He'll guide you.

00:41:02.283 --> 00:41:03.562
Okay. Thank you.

00:41:04.003 --> 00:41:04.642
Thank you.

00:41:08.923 --> 00:41:09.403
Thank you.

00:41:09.642 --> 00:41:11.722
All our fans and followers!

00:41:11.883 --> 00:41:14.202

Many newcomers

00:41:19.242 --> 00:41:20.642

00:41:22.763 --> 00:41:23.283

Because it's so delicious!

00:41:25.923 --> 00:41:27.803
One bite and you're hooked!

00:41:28.483 --> 00:41:30.602
Even our team devours these!

00:41:31.763 --> 00:41:34.522
Our new host Yan tried one bite

00:41:34.562 --> 00:41:35.403
and couldn't stop!

00:41:35.602 --> 00:41:36.522
Couldn't stop, right?

00:41:36.522 --> 00:41:37.602
Let us show you

00:41:37.602 --> 00:41:39.443
how nice texture it has.

00:41:39.522 --> 00:41:40.042
See?

00:41:40.403 --> 00:41:41.162
Try it!

00:41:43.923 --> 00:41:46.082
It's so juicy,

00:41:46.642 --> 00:41:48.722
tender,

00:41:48.843 --> 00:41:50.403
and chewy!

00:41:50.483 --> 00:41:51.363
How's this achieved?

00:41:51.522 --> 00:41:53.283
98 percent bone-free

00:41:53.483 --> 00:41:54.883
precision processing!

00:41:55.003 --> 00:41:56.843
And we have four flavors today.

00:41:56.923 --> 00:41:57.682
Five-spice,

00:41:58.003 --> 00:41:58.803
pickled pepper,

00:41:58.923 --> 00:42:00.602
and lemony sweet-sour.

00:42:00.642 --> 00:42:01.763
Here's the deal.

00:42:01.923 --> 00:42:03.682
Buy one set, get four packs!

00:42:05.642 --> 00:42:07.403
Yan can't stop munching!

00:42:07.642 --> 00:42:08.323
Indeed.

00:42:08.682 --> 00:42:11.363
One bite, you'd be obsessed.

00:42:11.602 --> 00:42:13.443
And it's not really spicy, right?

00:42:14.483 --> 00:42:14.763
Really.

00:42:14.763 --> 00:42:16.363
If you can't eat spicy food at all.

00:42:16.363 --> 00:42:17.162
Choose link 1!

00:42:17.162 --> 00:42:18.883
(Top left, claim coupon for discount)
The five-spice flavor isn't spicy at all.

00:42:19.082 --> 00:42:21.082
Click link 2
if you can handle mild spice.

00:42:21.202 --> 00:42:22.242
(Money rolling in)
The host chats with you,

00:42:22.242 --> 00:42:23.443
and you should interact!

00:42:24.443 --> 00:42:25.363
All you do is eat.

00:42:26.082 --> 00:42:26.963
You can eat,

00:42:27.323 --> 00:42:28.803
(Wealth pouring in)
but don't stuff your mouth.

00:42:29.202 --> 00:42:29.883
Table manners!

00:42:30.443 --> 00:42:32.963
You need to eat
with charm and enthusiasm!

00:42:33.162 --> 00:42:34.042
Only that can spark

00:42:34.042 --> 00:42:35.242
viewers' purchasing desire.

00:42:37.923 --> 00:42:39.562
Can't you handle such simple tasks?

00:42:40.082 --> 00:42:41.122
I don't understand

00:42:41.363 --> 00:42:42.403
how you became that...

00:42:42.403 --> 00:42:43.242
What's that?

00:42:43.403 --> 00:42:44.562
A news anchor.

00:42:45.642 --> 00:42:47.283
Next one is selling
spicy oil beef tripe.

00:42:47.363 --> 00:42:48.323
Can you handle this?

00:42:50.483 --> 00:42:50.923
Yes.

00:42:51.242 --> 00:42:52.763
Can you eat with charm?

00:42:53.042 --> 00:42:53.483
Yes.

00:42:53.923 --> 00:42:56.082
Can you interact?

00:42:57.202 --> 00:42:57.682
Yes.

00:42:59.522 --> 00:43:01.003

is delicious beef tripe!

00:43:03.722 --> 00:43:04.883
It's our new female host

00:43:04.883 --> 00:43:05.963
Yan's favorite, right?

00:43:06.162 --> 00:43:08.042
Today we'll prepare

00:43:08.122 --> 00:43:09.803
her favorite combo.

00:43:09.883 --> 00:43:10.682
How much?

00:43:10.803 --> 00:43:12.242
Good, more.

00:43:12.242 --> 00:43:13.082
A bit more, okay?

00:43:13.082 --> 00:43:14.003
Okay, thanks.

00:43:14.003 --> 00:43:15.803
Our sauce contains sesame paste.

00:43:15.803 --> 00:43:17.082
I'll mix it.

00:43:17.202 --> 00:43:19.202
Want some cilantro and scallions?

00:43:19.242 --> 00:43:19.843
Yes.

00:43:20.122 --> 00:43:20.602
No problem.

00:43:20.682 --> 00:43:22.963
You can make this at home, right?

00:43:23.003 --> 00:43:24.363
Right, customize to your taste.

00:43:24.363 --> 00:43:27.403
This is compatible with everything.

00:43:27.403 --> 00:43:27.843
Come on.

00:43:28.202 --> 00:43:29.722
Let's taste it. Okay?

00:43:30.883 --> 00:43:31.403
Let me try.

00:43:31.403 --> 00:43:32.162
More sesame sauce.

00:43:32.162 --> 00:43:33.122
Okay, more sauce.

00:43:33.122 --> 00:43:33.602
Right.

00:43:34.283 --> 00:43:35.722
Yan knows it!

00:43:38.698 --> 00:43:41.008
(Live Stream)

00:43:45.283 --> 00:43:46.682
Delicious.

00:43:47.602 --> 00:43:49.283
Super crispy!

00:43:50.242 --> 00:43:51.562
Feels so good...

00:43:53.642 --> 00:43:54.682
So chewy!

00:43:54.883 --> 00:43:55.483
Right?

00:43:55.682 --> 00:43:56.883
Don't miss out!

00:43:56.883 --> 00:43:58.722
Today's special deal is hard-won

00:43:58.722 --> 00:43:59.803
after tough negotiations.

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:00.202
Right?

00:44:00.202 --> 00:44:01.562
Our boss said...

00:44:01.682 --> 00:44:02.883
It's one-time only.

00:44:02.883 --> 00:44:04.763
Link will be offline after selling out.

00:44:05.082 --> 00:44:05.803
And now...

00:44:11.763 --> 00:44:14.923
The number you dialed is powered off.

00:44:43.602 --> 00:44:44.122
Xu Yan!

00:44:46.323 --> 00:44:46.963
Xu Yan!

00:44:51.923 --> 00:44:52.602
Xu Yan!

00:45:01.202 --> 00:45:01.803
What's wrong?

00:45:03.803 --> 00:45:05.042
How do you know I am here?

00:45:05.323 --> 00:45:06.403
Yu Yiming told me.

00:45:06.843 --> 00:45:08.403
Why are you doing live streams now?

00:45:08.642 --> 00:45:09.616
Where's Shen Haoming?

00:45:11.483 --> 00:45:12.122
What's going on?

00:45:12.642 --> 00:45:13.642
Go take a seat!

00:45:13.963 --> 00:45:14.403
Come on.

00:45:16.042 --> 00:45:18.443
That guy is so scheming.

00:45:20.042 --> 00:45:21.202
He's quite cunning.

00:45:21.923 --> 00:45:22.682
Have warm water.

00:45:22.963 --> 00:45:23.803
Good for you.

00:45:24.082 --> 00:45:24.642
Thanks.

00:45:25.923 --> 00:45:27.283
I thought he was

00:45:27.403 --> 00:45:28.682
some one-in-a-million good guy.

00:45:28.763 --> 00:45:29.562
Trash!

00:45:30.162 --> 00:45:31.283
You loved him,

00:45:31.363 --> 00:45:32.403
married him,

00:45:32.843 --> 00:45:34.082
helped his career,

00:45:34.082 --> 00:45:36.122
took care of his entire family!

00:45:36.242 --> 00:45:38.283
Yet he showed no mercy at all.

00:45:41.763 --> 00:45:42.562
But at first,

00:45:42.562 --> 00:45:43.923
I did wrong.

00:45:46.602 --> 00:45:47.602
In this world,

00:45:47.843 --> 00:45:49.202
apologizing doesn't guarantee

00:45:49.363 --> 00:45:51.722
forgiveness for wrongs.

00:45:56.923 --> 00:45:58.363
But luckily, I've realized

00:45:59.363 --> 00:46:01.642
Shen Haoming isn't the person
I imagined him to be.

00:46:03.642 --> 00:46:04.562
I also understand

00:46:05.682 --> 00:46:06.722
his love for me

00:46:06.722 --> 00:46:08.283
isn't what I thought it was.

00:46:10.722 --> 00:46:11.483
That's good.

00:46:16.803 --> 00:46:19.162
Once the divorce
cooling-off period ends,

00:46:19.283 --> 00:46:20.363
we'll finalize the divorce

00:46:22.562 --> 00:46:24.483
and we'll have no more ties,

00:46:25.202 --> 00:46:26.803
or mutual deception.

00:46:32.843 --> 00:46:35.242
Then why did you quit your job?

00:46:35.682 --> 00:46:36.763
Wasn't that something

00:46:36.763 --> 00:46:37.642
you worked hard for?

00:46:38.843 --> 00:46:39.963
I thought so.

00:46:44.122 --> 00:46:45.642
Shen Haoming was involved in this too.

00:46:50.042 --> 00:46:51.522
But I heard the live streams

00:46:51.923 --> 00:46:53.883
require 12 hours daily.

00:46:54.323 --> 00:46:55.602
In peak season,

00:46:55.682 --> 00:46:57.283
you might have no time to sleep.

00:46:57.283 --> 00:46:58.923
Several hours of sleep at best.

00:46:59.403 --> 00:47:00.363
That's too harsh.

00:47:00.363 --> 00:47:01.923
Look at you now.

00:47:02.443 --> 00:47:03.283
I'm perfectly fine.

00:47:03.562 --> 00:47:04.923
Stop forcing yourself.

00:47:07.803 --> 00:47:09.122
There are many more tougher jobs

00:47:09.122 --> 00:47:09.963
than livestreaming.

00:47:10.042 --> 00:47:11.483
I'm just getting started.

00:47:11.803 --> 00:47:12.682
Besides,

00:47:13.883 --> 00:47:15.283
as a newcomer,

00:47:15.323 --> 00:47:17.242
I need to learn the ropes.

00:47:17.642 --> 00:47:19.003
It won't last long like this.

00:47:20.283 --> 00:47:20.803
Okay.

00:47:24.843 --> 00:47:26.883
Besides, I feel relaxed now.

00:47:28.562 --> 00:47:30.202
Unlike before,

00:47:30.202 --> 00:47:31.602
I always feared to be revealed,

00:47:32.162 --> 00:47:33.843
living in perpetual anxiety.

00:47:38.082 --> 00:47:39.483
Anyway, don't eat like this again.

00:47:39.803 --> 00:47:41.323
Your body can't handle this.

00:47:43.883 --> 00:47:44.522
Have some more.

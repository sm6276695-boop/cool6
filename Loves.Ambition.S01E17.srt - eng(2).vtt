Check this out, everyone.

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:36.328
The Barbie pants I'm holding
come with the belt design.

00:02:36.408 --> 00:02:37.207
They're in Link 1.

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:38.888
And our host, Yan,

00:02:39.048 --> 00:02:40.647
is wearing the pair available in Link 2.

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:42.087
Order according to your needs.

00:02:42.527 --> 00:02:44.848
These Barbie pants
truly contour your figure,

00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:45.848
provide real warmth,

00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.128
and most importantly,
have exceptional stretchiness.

00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:49.927
Let's demonstrate.

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:55.807
Dear viewers,

00:02:55.807 --> 00:02:57.168
look at what Yan is holding.

00:02:57.288 --> 00:02:58.807
These are expired instant noodles,

00:02:58.967 --> 00:03:00.008
expired coffee,

00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:01.207
and some stubborn stains

00:03:01.207 --> 00:03:02.647
like expired milk.

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:03.728
To clean them,

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.728
we'd need to sweep first
and then mop, right?

00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:06.967
But today is different

00:03:07.247 --> 00:03:10.008
because we have this high-end
intelligent floor washer.

00:03:10.527 --> 00:03:12.728
Effortlessly, without manual work,

00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:16.128
we achieve perfect cleanliness.

00:03:16.288 --> 00:03:17.247

00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:18.367

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:22.568
Did you see?

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:23.207
The noodles

00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:24.288
get completely vacuumed.

00:03:24.687 --> 00:03:26.168
Then let's pull it back

00:03:26.448 --> 00:03:27.568
and wipe casually.

00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:29.128
Spotless!

00:03:29.168 --> 00:03:30.527
And it's effortless.

00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:32.128
You can do it single-handedly.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:32.608
Exactly.

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:33.687
It's power assisted.

00:03:33.687 --> 00:03:34.168
Right.

00:03:34.168 --> 00:03:36.608
And it's not a noisy machine.

00:03:36.888 --> 00:03:37.848
This price drop

00:03:37.848 --> 00:03:39.207

on the table for our viewers.

00:03:59.087 --> 00:03:59.807
It's light.

00:03:59.807 --> 00:04:01.128
So no issues at all.

00:04:02.927 --> 00:04:03.767
Check your phone.

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:04.888
It's available in Link 1.

00:04:06.048 --> 00:04:06.848
It's furry.

00:04:07.888 --> 00:04:08.656
It's on her face.

00:04:09.888 --> 00:04:11.247
Know what this means?

Thanks.

00:04:29.367 --> 00:04:31.768
I've noticed these steel bars
sitting here for days.

00:04:31.768 --> 00:04:32.408
Is it okay?

00:04:32.487 --> 00:04:33.367
How is it okay?

00:04:33.927 --> 00:04:35.807
When it rains

00:04:35.887 --> 00:04:37.088
and then the sun bakes them,

00:04:37.288 --> 00:04:38.807
they'll completely rust.

00:04:39.127 --> 00:04:40.687
They'll rust overnight,

00:04:40.687 --> 00:04:41.608
totally oxidized.

00:04:41.728 --> 00:04:43.247
So these bars will oxidize?

00:04:43.648 --> 00:04:44.127
Exactly.

00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:45.528
Look at that building.

00:04:45.648 --> 00:04:46.728
No protection at all.

00:04:46.768 --> 00:04:47.887
When rain gets inside,

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.768
all the steel bars rust.

00:04:49.927 --> 00:04:51.247
So there's lots of steel inside?

00:04:51.288 --> 00:04:51.807
Right.

00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:52.687
It's all good steel.

00:04:52.687 --> 00:04:54.048
Now it's all wasted?

00:04:54.208 --> 00:04:55.327
Rust makes them unusable.

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:56.240
And what about those?

00:04:56.528 --> 00:04:57.528
Can't use them, either.

00:04:58.168 --> 00:04:58.728
Got it.

Listen up!

00:05:14.088 --> 00:05:16.247
We're gathered here today

00:05:16.247 --> 00:05:17.168
for two matters.

00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:18.088
First,

00:05:18.247 --> 00:05:20.432
allow me to formally introduce

00:05:21.397 --> 00:05:25.088
Mr. Shen, who was dispatched
by the group's headquarters.

00:05:25.487 --> 00:05:26.367
Let's welcome him.

00:05:30.408 --> 00:05:30.968
Alright.

00:05:31.447 --> 00:05:32.447
Second,

00:05:33.048 --> 00:05:36.768
Mr. Shen has some instructions
for everyone.

00:05:37.367 --> 00:05:37.968
Please.

00:05:40.088 --> 00:05:42.007
I'll skip the formalities.

00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:44.168
My purpose here

00:05:45.048 --> 00:05:48.208
is to investigate the project delays.

00:05:51.848 --> 00:05:53.408
Of course there are issues.

00:05:54.327 --> 00:05:56.848
All the problems
are laid out plain as day.

00:05:57.528 --> 00:05:59.848
Investor Mr. Wu ran off with the money

00:06:00.088 --> 00:06:03.048
and wronged all my workers, right?

00:06:03.048 --> 00:06:03.487
Right.

00:06:03.487 --> 00:06:04.807
Funds were depleted after he ran.

00:06:04.807 --> 00:06:05.608
Right?

00:06:05.648 --> 00:06:06.088
Right.

00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:07.168
As for those funds...

00:06:07.807 --> 00:06:08.807
Quiet down! Quiet!

00:06:09.367 --> 00:06:10.768
Let Mr. Shen finish speaking.

00:06:12.887 --> 00:06:14.327
Regarding Wu Chengming's case,

00:06:14.528 --> 00:06:15.608
I'll handle it for sure.

00:06:16.288 --> 00:06:18.048
What I need to emphasize today is

00:06:18.927 --> 00:06:19.848
these days,

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:21.528
I've discovered

00:06:21.608 --> 00:06:23.247
that at this site,

00:06:23.927 --> 00:06:26.088
major construction issues have surfaced.

00:06:26.807 --> 00:06:29.528
The steel reinforcement has been exposed
to the elements too long,

00:06:29.728 --> 00:06:30.648
causing oxidation.

00:06:31.927 --> 00:06:35.088
Delayed window installations

00:06:36.048 --> 00:06:38.032
left walls and ground waterlogged

00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:40.327
and all pipelines moldy.

00:06:41.088 --> 00:06:43.408
Missing wire mesh reinforcement

00:06:44.168 --> 00:06:45.327
has resulted in slab cracks.

00:06:46.567 --> 00:06:47.927
Due to these failures,

00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:49.288
immediate rectification and rework

00:06:49.327 --> 00:06:49.927
are required.

00:06:50.487 --> 00:06:52.048
Rework? With no pay?

00:06:52.927 --> 00:06:54.247
Show us the money first.

00:06:55.007 --> 00:06:56.007
Why is rework needed?

00:06:56.127 --> 00:06:57.887
Mr. Shen is demanding wildly.

00:06:58.327 --> 00:07:00.048
Even from your office,

00:07:00.288 --> 00:07:02.487
you know the construction site
inside and out.

00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:05.567
Did you hear him, department heads?

00:07:05.848 --> 00:07:06.848
Okay. Rework.

00:07:07.048 --> 00:07:08.367
You need money for that.

00:07:08.927 --> 00:07:09.608
Mr. Shen,

00:07:10.487 --> 00:07:12.168
the group has no allocated budget.

00:07:12.327 --> 00:07:14.247
What can we proceed

00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:15.408
and rework with?

00:07:15.447 --> 00:07:15.848
Right.

00:07:15.887 --> 00:07:16.327
Am I right?

00:07:16.367 --> 00:07:16.848
Exactly.

00:07:17.048 --> 00:07:17.848
There's no money.

00:07:18.168 --> 00:07:19.807
It's mainly about money.

00:07:19.968 --> 00:07:21.327
No money, no rework.

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:21.807
Right.

00:07:21.848 --> 00:07:22.528
Right?

00:07:22.648 --> 00:07:23.768
Without money...

00:07:23.807 --> 00:07:25.127
Quiet! Quiet!

00:07:25.768 --> 00:07:26.807
Quiet! Quiet!

00:07:30.288 --> 00:07:31.367
Lost control, have we?

00:07:33.127 --> 00:07:33.768
Everyone,

00:07:33.968 --> 00:07:35.687
we've collaborated for years.

00:07:35.807 --> 00:07:37.088
Challenges exist,

00:07:37.247 --> 00:07:39.127
but Mr. Shen's new here.

00:07:39.367 --> 00:07:40.768
He needs time to understand.

00:07:40.848 --> 00:07:43.088
How about this? Do me a favor.

00:07:43.288 --> 00:07:43.807
Let's...

00:07:43.848 --> 00:07:48.048
We followed
the company's guidelines, right?

00:07:48.247 --> 00:07:50.757
Now you are accusing us
of non-compliance baselessly.

00:07:50.757 --> 00:07:51.728
That's not fair!

00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:53.048
That's not fair!

00:07:53.088 --> 00:07:53.528
Exactly!

00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:54.168
Right?

00:07:54.848 --> 00:07:57.288
Produce your individual contracts.

00:07:58.168 --> 00:08:00.288
We'll verify construction quality

00:08:00.487 --> 00:08:03.648
against initial specifications.

00:08:04.048 --> 00:08:06.968
No individual contracts.
We're just subcontractors.

00:08:07.807 --> 00:08:10.447
Then we'll sign
new individual contracts today.

00:08:11.447 --> 00:08:13.048
How to sign that?

00:08:13.408 --> 00:08:14.007
Exactly.

00:08:14.088 --> 00:08:17.447
The contracts specify
construction standards.

00:08:18.608 --> 00:08:23.367
(Labor Contract)
Compliant ones receive timely payments.

00:08:24.247 --> 00:08:26.648
Non-compliant work gets rectified

00:08:27.088 --> 00:08:29.968
with penalties for poor execution.

00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:32.648
All is clearly stipulated.

00:08:35.888 --> 00:08:36.727
Mr. Shen,

00:08:36.888 --> 00:08:38.447
this approach is unreasonable.

00:08:39.288 --> 00:08:42.368
I've managed projects for decades.

00:08:42.807 --> 00:08:44.768
These workers answer to me.

00:08:45.368 --> 00:08:47.847
We work under master contracts.
No individual contracts.

00:08:48.447 --> 00:08:50.168
You're breaking industry norms.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:51.847
It undermines my authority.

00:08:52.128 --> 00:08:53.248
No one will respect me.

00:08:53.368 --> 00:08:56.807
Our contracts
only govern construction standards

00:08:57.288 --> 00:08:58.447
and payment terms.

00:08:59.368 --> 00:09:01.048
No management authority is included.

00:09:01.727 --> 00:09:05.648
But from now on, all workers' salaries
won't go through your hands.

00:09:06.967 --> 00:09:12.048
And future financial audits
won't be a burden anymore.

00:09:12.727 --> 00:09:13.528
Isn't that good?

00:09:14.408 --> 00:09:15.168
Yes.

00:09:15.567 --> 00:09:16.648
It's great.

00:09:17.087 --> 00:09:18.408
It's great.

00:09:25.128 --> 00:09:27.128
- So much money?
- It's a lot!

00:09:29.207 --> 00:09:30.408
Starting today,

00:09:31.168 --> 00:09:34.368
report to my office
after work every day.

00:09:35.087 --> 00:09:36.768
Wages will be paid daily.

00:09:37.248 --> 00:09:38.087
Does your word count?

00:09:38.128 --> 00:09:39.528
Can we trust your word?

00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:40.768
Do you mean it?

00:09:40.847 --> 00:09:43.087
Those who agree can sign the contract.

00:09:43.528 --> 00:09:44.128
I'll sign it!

00:09:45.368 --> 00:09:46.168
No pushing.

00:09:46.727 --> 00:09:48.087
Stop shoving! Wait your turn.

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:48.727
Mr. Shen,

00:09:49.128 --> 00:09:50.207
if you insist on this,

00:09:50.327 --> 00:09:51.768
we're walking out.

00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:53.168
We won't work today.

00:09:53.368 --> 00:09:54.008
Brothers,

00:09:54.288 --> 00:09:55.288
- let's go!
- Let's go!

00:09:55.288 --> 00:09:55.847
Let's go home.

00:09:56.008 --> 00:09:57.927
Li! Li, don't leave!

00:09:58.128 --> 00:09:59.087
Li, don't leave!

00:09:59.168 --> 00:09:59.727
Nobody leaves!

00:09:59.727 --> 00:10:00.368
I'm leaving.

00:10:00.368 --> 00:10:01.927
Mr. Shen, these are all key personnel.

00:10:02.048 --> 00:10:02.888
If they leave,

00:10:02.967 --> 00:10:04.288
the project will collapse.

00:10:04.327 --> 00:10:05.087
Move aside.

00:10:05.248 --> 00:10:06.008
Don't go.

00:10:08.288 --> 00:10:09.207
Hello, Mr. Zhang?

00:10:10.087 --> 00:10:11.248
Come report

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:12.967
at 11 as agreed yesterday.

00:10:13.408 --> 00:10:14.087
Okay, Mr. Shen.

00:10:14.327 --> 00:10:15.927
I'll bring the whole tech team with me.

00:10:19.967 --> 00:10:20.648
Good.

00:10:21.408 --> 00:10:22.607
Don't regret this.

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:23.488
Let's go!

00:10:23.967 --> 00:10:24.927
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:10:24.967 --> 00:10:25.687
Let's go.

00:10:25.687 --> 00:10:30.055
♪Cause I just have been hurt
too many times♪

00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:35.008
♪I'm giving it all,
just getting nothing back♪

00:10:35.008 --> 00:10:37.048
The money came at the perfect time.

00:10:40.327 --> 00:10:41.128
Sign here.

00:10:41.288 --> 00:10:41.847
Okay.

00:10:42.128 --> 00:10:42.648
Here?

00:10:42.807 --> 00:10:44.368
I'll keep this copy. You take that one.

00:10:44.488 --> 00:10:45.607
Great, thanks.

00:10:45.607 --> 00:10:47.207
Okay. This one's yours.

00:10:48.327 --> 00:10:49.128
Right, okay.

00:10:49.327 --> 00:10:49.847
Thanks.

00:10:49.847 --> 00:10:50.288
Sign here.

00:10:51.727 --> 00:10:52.128
Okay.

00:10:54.168 --> 00:10:54.807
Perfect.

00:10:55.248 --> 00:10:55.847
Sign here.

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:57.567
(Labor Contract)
Sign your name here.

00:10:57.687 --> 00:10:58.207
Right.

00:10:59.168 --> 00:10:59.727
Here.

00:11:00.008 --> 00:11:00.447
Come on.

00:11:03.048 --> 00:11:05.048
Mr. Shen, you wanted to see me?

00:11:05.967 --> 00:11:06.248
Sit.

00:11:12.727 --> 00:11:14.048
Let's discuss

00:11:14.488 --> 00:11:16.648
the specifics of the project delays.

00:11:17.327 --> 00:11:18.207
No problem.

00:11:18.607 --> 00:11:19.288
Mr. Shen,

00:11:19.368 --> 00:11:21.847
I genuinely admire your work ethic.

00:11:22.128 --> 00:11:23.087
Ask anything you need.

00:11:23.168 --> 00:11:23.888
I'll cooperate.

00:11:26.048 --> 00:11:27.447
Your report to headquarters

00:11:27.447 --> 00:11:30.687
stated material and labor cost increases

00:11:31.128 --> 00:11:33.447
made the project unprofitable
for the contractor,

00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:35.607
leading to his unauthorized loans

00:11:36.048 --> 00:11:37.687
and eventual absconding with funds.

00:11:38.207 --> 00:11:38.768
Yes.

00:11:39.248 --> 00:11:40.567
That's the whole story.

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:44.528
Material and labor costs did rise.

00:11:45.048 --> 00:11:48.087
But there is a sequence problem.

00:11:49.248 --> 00:11:51.447
Repeated rework delayed our progress,

00:11:52.248 --> 00:11:53.567
squandering labor

00:11:54.288 --> 00:11:56.008
and materials.

00:11:56.447 --> 00:11:57.648
We had to restock

00:11:58.087 --> 00:11:59.207
and reconstruct.

00:11:59.567 --> 00:12:00.888
Over time,

00:12:01.528 --> 00:12:04.528
it resulted in increases
in material and labor costs.

00:12:10.727 --> 00:12:14.567
Every rework cycle meant new purchases

00:12:15.288 --> 00:12:18.008
and recalculated labor expenses.

00:12:18.248 --> 00:12:20.727
There were plenty of opportunities
for manipulation.

00:12:24.087 --> 00:12:26.927
In other words, embezzlement.

00:12:29.488 --> 00:12:32.447
You're saying the contractors
sabotaged work?

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:36.008
Those scoundrels.

00:12:37.847 --> 00:12:39.807
As branch head,

00:12:40.248 --> 00:12:43.368
you failed to supervise contractors

00:12:44.768 --> 00:12:46.008
and repeatedly pled ignorance.

00:12:46.648 --> 00:12:47.888
Mr. Shen,

00:12:48.248 --> 00:12:49.607
you don't understand.

00:12:50.048 --> 00:12:52.368
After Wu from
Anqiang Construction absconded,

00:12:53.528 --> 00:12:54.847
I have been fully occupied.

00:12:55.288 --> 00:12:57.327
Hundreds of workers mean
hundreds of mouths to feed.

00:12:57.447 --> 00:12:58.687
They need to eat and get paid.

00:12:58.687 --> 00:13:00.368
I also need to report back to the group.

00:13:00.607 --> 00:13:01.128
I...

00:13:01.967 --> 00:13:02.607
Three days.

00:13:04.648 --> 00:13:05.687
You have only three days.

00:13:07.248 --> 00:13:11.408
From project initiation till now,
all procurement quotes,

00:13:12.008 --> 00:13:13.008
actual expenditures,

00:13:13.567 --> 00:13:14.528
and employee salaries,

00:13:14.847 --> 00:13:15.727
compile them for me.

00:13:16.008 --> 00:13:16.727
No way.

00:13:17.248 --> 00:13:18.288
Three days aren't enough.

00:13:18.727 --> 00:13:19.687
Even a week won't work.

00:13:20.447 --> 00:13:21.207
Three days.

00:13:34.807 --> 00:13:35.327
Come in.

00:13:39.087 --> 00:13:39.768
Mr. Qiu,

00:13:40.727 --> 00:13:43.687
I'd like to request
doing a solo live stream.

00:13:45.368 --> 00:13:46.168
Are you sure?

00:13:48.408 --> 00:13:49.648
Hello, everyone.

00:13:49.648 --> 00:13:50.687
Hello.

00:13:50.687 --> 00:13:51.327
Hey, everyone.

00:13:51.327 --> 00:13:53.327
Welcome to Yan's live stream.

00:13:53.687 --> 00:13:56.408
Today, we're still selling
our top-selling product:

00:13:56.447 --> 00:13:57.488
boneless chicken feet.

00:13:57.488 --> 00:13:58.128
Right.

00:13:58.327 --> 00:13:59.327
Today...

00:13:59.888 --> 00:14:01.687
(Yes, people are asking
for chicken feet.)

00:14:01.888 --> 00:14:02.368
Yes.

00:14:02.368 --> 00:14:04.408
Today's deal is even more explosive.

00:14:04.607 --> 00:14:06.008
Here's how today's promotion works.

00:14:06.048 --> 00:14:08.207
Let me explain
our benefits mechanism, okay?

00:14:13.008 --> 00:14:15.528
(For one regular 500g pack
of chicken feet,)

00:14:15.528 --> 00:14:18.768
(we'll give you a 250g pack)

00:14:19.128 --> 00:14:21.248
(plus another 250g pack.)

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:24.048
(So you get three packs
for the price of one.)

00:14:24.607 --> 00:14:25.648
(Buy one, get two free.)

00:14:25.648 --> 00:14:26.727
(Buy one, get two free.)

00:14:26.727 --> 00:14:28.447
(Today's deal
is incredibly cost-effective.)

00:14:28.807 --> 00:14:29.488
- (Right?)
- (Exactly.)

00:14:31.768 --> 00:14:33.248
Take a closer look.

00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:35.327
141.

00:14:35.408 --> 00:14:36.447
141. This isn't right.

00:14:36.607 --> 00:14:37.207
This one?

00:14:37.207 --> 00:14:38.008
There's an issue.

00:14:38.008 --> 00:14:39.087
You need to verify this.

00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:39.687
Okay.

00:14:39.727 --> 00:14:40.488
Take a look.

00:14:41.087 --> 00:14:41.768
You guys check.

00:14:41.927 --> 00:14:42.607
No problem.

00:14:42.607 --> 00:14:43.368
It's good here.

00:14:43.408 --> 00:14:43.967
Look here.

00:14:44.248 --> 00:14:44.847
Check here.

00:14:45.327 --> 00:14:46.168
You guys continue.

00:14:46.168 --> 00:14:47.168
(For Resting)
Okay, you go ahead, Mr. Shen.

00:14:49.368 --> 00:14:50.408
What we just reviewed...

00:14:50.567 --> 00:14:51.248
Hello, Chen.

00:14:51.567 --> 00:14:52.327
Mr. Shen,

00:14:53.128 --> 00:14:55.847
there's something you need to check.

00:14:56.207 --> 00:14:57.648
I've sent the link to your phone.

00:14:57.888 --> 00:14:58.408
Okay.

00:14:59.852 --> 00:15:01.351
(Chen Lin: Link)

00:15:02.607 --> 00:15:04.048
(We're selling at such a low price.)

00:15:04.048 --> 00:15:06.168
(So viewers who love chicken feet,)

00:15:06.408 --> 00:15:07.408
(place your orders now.)

00:15:07.488 --> 00:15:08.447
(It's delicious.)

00:15:08.567 --> 00:15:10.327
(Warm Harbor placed 20 orders!)

00:15:10.528 --> 00:15:11.984
(20 orders! Thanks for the support.)

00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:14.488
(Thank you, Warm Harbor.)

00:15:14.528 --> 00:15:15.888
(Thank you so much.)

00:15:15.888 --> 00:15:16.447
(Thank you.)

00:15:16.447 --> 00:15:17.927
(You love chicken feet, right?)

00:15:18.807 --> 00:15:20.207
(I super like you.)

00:15:20.288 --> 00:15:21.368
(Ms. Xu, you're so pretty.)

00:15:21.368 --> 00:15:23.567
(Warm Harbor sent a carnival gift.)

00:15:24.008 --> 00:15:25.888
(Thanks for the carnival gift,
Warm Harbor.)

00:15:26.248 --> 00:15:27.447
(Thanks for liking me.)

00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:28.567
(Thank you, Warm Harbor,)

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:29.567
(for supporting me.)

00:15:29.607 --> 00:15:31.807
(If I select better products later,)

00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:33.168
(I'll share them with you, okay?)

00:15:33.207 --> 00:15:34.927
(Thank you, Warm Harbor.)

00:15:35.087 --> 00:15:35.807
(Now,)

00:15:35.847 --> 00:15:37.687
(we'll continue
selling our hot product:)

00:15:37.888 --> 00:15:38.927
(boneless chicken feet.)

00:15:39.008 --> 00:15:39.648
(That's right.)

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.338
(Do not imitate)

00:15:43.668 --> 00:15:45.644
(Confirm order.)

00:15:45.768 --> 00:15:47.927
PromiseKeeper placed 50 orders!

00:15:48.008 --> 00:15:49.488
(PromiseKeeper: 50 orders)
Thanks for placing 50 orders!

00:15:50.768 --> 00:15:52.048
They really love chicken feet.

00:15:52.048 --> 00:15:52.528
Exactly.

00:15:52.607 --> 00:15:53.207
Right?

00:15:53.488 --> 00:15:55.248
Thank you, PromiseKeeper.

00:15:55.248 --> 00:15:56.168
(Your chicken feet...)

00:15:56.168 --> 00:15:57.888
(Backend team, listen up.)

00:15:58.128 --> 00:16:01.207
(For the orders from PromiseKeeper
and Warm Harbor,)

00:16:01.207 --> 00:16:01.727
(well,)

00:16:02.008 --> 00:16:03.087
(expedite shipping, okay?)

00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:03.967
(Copy that. Expedite!)

00:16:05.248 --> 00:16:06.768
(Ms. Xu, I bought some too.)

00:16:06.807 --> 00:16:07.967
(I like Sichuan cuisine,)

00:16:08.087 --> 00:16:09.207
(and I like you more.)

00:16:09.687 --> 00:16:10.488
(Thank you.)

00:16:10.727 --> 00:16:12.888
Warm Harbor placed 70 orders!

00:16:13.087 --> 00:16:14.687
(Thanks for placing 70 orders!)

00:16:15.008 --> 00:16:16.128
(Thank you for liking me.)

00:16:16.168 --> 00:16:17.248
(Thank you, Warm Harbor,)

00:16:17.408 --> 00:16:18.528
(for supporting me.)

00:16:18.567 --> 00:16:19.248
(Now,)

00:16:19.248 --> 00:16:22.128
(we'll continue selling
our hot product: boneless chicken feet.)

00:16:22.224 --> 00:16:22.888
(That's right.)

00:16:22.888 --> 00:16:25.248
(PromiseKeeper: 100 orders)
PromiseKeeper placed 100 orders!

00:16:25.408 --> 00:16:27.727
(Warm Harbor: 150 orders)
Warm Harbor placed 150 orders!

00:16:27.888 --> 00:16:29.488
Thanks for supporting us
with 150 orders!

00:16:30.567 --> 00:16:31.648
(Thanks for your support!)

00:16:32.687 --> 00:16:33.888
(Thanks for your support!)

00:16:34.607 --> 00:16:35.807
Warm Harbor?

00:16:35.927 --> 00:16:37.008
It's him again?

00:16:37.327 --> 00:16:38.567
All the 50, 70, and 100 orders.

00:16:38.567 --> 00:16:40.288
Can they really consume
hundreds of orders?

00:16:40.607 --> 00:16:41.368
Is he a wholesaler?

00:16:42.447 --> 00:16:44.128
Why care if he's a wholesaler?

00:16:44.408 --> 00:16:46.447
This is the biggest spender
from her live stream.

00:16:46.847 --> 00:16:48.408
Undoubtedly the top contributor.

00:16:49.447 --> 00:16:51.528
Well... Uh...

00:16:52.207 --> 00:16:54.128
Do we have enough stock? Check now.

00:16:54.128 --> 00:16:55.288
- Check stock.
- Roger that!

00:16:55.327 --> 00:16:56.128
If possible,

00:16:56.168 --> 00:16:57.927
(Do not imitate)
(expedite shipping for them, okay?)

00:16:58.128 --> 00:16:58.847
- (Okay.)
- (Alright.)

00:16:58.967 --> 00:16:59.847
(Let's move on.)

00:16:59.927 --> 00:17:01.607
(We don't have much stock left.)

00:17:01.768 --> 00:17:03.567
Mr. Shen, come here please.

00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:04.087
(Thank you.)

00:17:04.087 --> 00:17:04.528
(Thanks.)

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:05.607
(Thanks for the support.)

00:17:05.607 --> 00:17:06.248
(Thank you.)

00:17:08.607 --> 00:17:09.488
That's childish.

00:17:16.728 --> 00:17:17.647
Ms. Xu.

00:17:19.887 --> 00:17:21.887
I've talked so much my lips are chapped.

00:17:25.208 --> 00:17:28.248
Hosting live streams
is like being a celebrity.

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:30.488
You need to pamper and retain your fans.

00:17:31.087 --> 00:17:34.607
Warm Harbor's massive orders
in your stream

00:17:34.688 --> 00:17:37.167
could stock a small supermarket.

00:17:37.488 --> 00:17:39.448
They just want to meet you offline

00:17:39.528 --> 00:17:40.847
and have coffee with you.

00:17:41.167 --> 00:17:43.607
That's not unreasonable, right?

00:17:58.048 --> 00:17:59.208
Understood, Mr. Qiu.

00:18:00.048 --> 00:18:00.768
I'll go.

00:18:01.887 --> 00:18:02.847
You finally came around.

00:18:28.528 --> 00:18:29.887
Excuse me.

00:18:31.208 --> 00:18:34.448
Are you Warm Harbor?

00:18:35.208 --> 00:18:35.728
No.

00:18:35.847 --> 00:18:36.607
Wrong person.

00:18:37.288 --> 00:18:38.288
Sorry about that.

00:18:40.807 --> 00:18:41.647
Sis-in-law.

00:18:59.807 --> 00:19:00.887
Top contributor?

00:19:03.448 --> 00:19:04.567
Warm Harbor?

00:19:05.887 --> 00:19:07.167
My teacher taught me:

00:19:07.327 --> 00:19:08.807
Home is the warm harbor.

00:19:12.607 --> 00:19:13.768
Your teacher was right.

00:19:15.248 --> 00:19:15.968
Haochen,

00:19:16.647 --> 00:19:18.768
where'd you get money
for the stream orders?

00:19:19.968 --> 00:19:21.688
I used Ms. Hui's phone.

00:19:22.847 --> 00:19:23.688
Ms. Hui,

00:19:24.127 --> 00:19:25.127
did you top up?

00:19:25.887 --> 00:19:26.807
It's done.

00:19:27.127 --> 00:19:27.567
Here.

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:28.127
Thanks.

00:19:30.367 --> 00:19:32.127
Can I repay you in cash later?

00:19:32.288 --> 00:19:33.008
Okay.

00:19:33.807 --> 00:19:35.008
I'm happy to do anything

00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:35.768
to help Xu Yan.

00:19:41.008 --> 00:19:42.048
What's wrong?

00:19:42.327 --> 00:19:44.048
I'll transfer the money to Ms. Hui.

00:19:44.167 --> 00:19:45.008
Tell her later...

00:19:45.327 --> 00:19:46.367
Don't bother.

00:19:46.488 --> 00:19:48.048
I'll repay her with my gift money.

00:19:48.048 --> 00:19:48.728
It's done.

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:49.728
Wait.

00:19:50.768 --> 00:19:51.567
Shen Haochen,

00:19:53.887 --> 00:19:56.728
remember two things from now on.

00:19:57.807 --> 00:19:58.448
First,

00:19:59.248 --> 00:20:02.367
no more ordering from live streams.

00:20:02.567 --> 00:20:03.327
And second?

00:20:05.847 --> 00:20:06.488
Second,

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:10.327
remember what I just said.

00:20:15.367 --> 00:20:15.968
Wait.

00:20:17.407 --> 00:20:18.008
By the way,

00:20:18.607 --> 00:20:20.087
all the stuff you bought

00:20:21.327 --> 00:20:23.127
wasn't shipped to your home.

00:20:23.607 --> 00:20:24.407
Where did it go?

00:20:25.448 --> 00:20:27.288
My brother supports an orphanage.

00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:28.928
I donated everything there.

00:20:36.087 --> 00:20:37.167
You're quite smart.

00:20:39.448 --> 00:20:40.688
Not that you did right.

00:20:44.288 --> 00:20:45.167
Sis-in-law,

00:20:45.807 --> 00:20:47.768
I really miss you.

00:20:48.008 --> 00:20:49.528
Mom misses you too.

00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:51.968
We've all lost weight lately.

00:20:52.528 --> 00:20:54.008
I miss your cooking.

00:20:57.127 --> 00:20:58.327
Let me show you something.

00:21:03.647 --> 00:21:04.288
Look.

00:21:05.407 --> 00:21:07.208
You don't have to move out
for your business.

00:21:07.567 --> 00:21:10.048
Look how unhappy my brother is.

00:21:10.127 --> 00:21:11.327
He often zones out.

00:21:17.167 --> 00:21:17.807
Tell me.

00:21:17.887 --> 00:21:19.048
What did my brother do?

00:21:19.167 --> 00:21:20.288
I'll have my mom beat him.

00:21:23.087 --> 00:21:24.208
No.

00:21:26.847 --> 00:21:29.567
Your brother is just overwhelmed
with work.

00:21:29.847 --> 00:21:31.488
So don't bother him all the time.

00:21:31.728 --> 00:21:32.768
That's not like that.

00:21:32.768 --> 00:21:35.688
I can tell he's just missing you.

00:21:36.127 --> 00:21:37.208
Can you forgive him

00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:38.567
and come home with me?

00:21:39.887 --> 00:21:42.248
I'm begging you.

00:21:50.448 --> 00:21:51.887
Can't you really come home?

00:21:57.327 --> 00:21:58.167
Now look.

00:21:59.048 --> 00:22:00.288
Both of you left home.

00:22:01.448 --> 00:22:02.768
The house feels completely empty.

00:22:11.208 --> 00:22:12.567
Where is your brother?

00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:15.248
My dad sent him
to a branch office out of town.

00:22:15.448 --> 00:22:16.928
He might not return for months.

00:22:23.087 --> 00:22:23.688
Haochen.

00:22:25.488 --> 00:22:27.327
Do you remember my phone number?

00:22:29.607 --> 00:22:31.048
Call me anytime if you do.

00:22:31.768 --> 00:22:32.887
If you miss me,

00:22:33.208 --> 00:22:34.087
just call me.

00:22:34.288 --> 00:22:35.087
I'll come see you.

00:22:35.647 --> 00:22:38.087
We can go wherever you want. Okay?

00:22:41.167 --> 00:22:41.928
Really?

00:22:42.367 --> 00:22:43.448
Did I ever lie to you?

00:22:44.327 --> 00:22:45.327
Promise?

00:22:45.448 --> 00:22:46.127
Promise.

00:22:49.208 --> 00:22:49.887
Slow down.

00:22:50.567 --> 00:22:51.688
I can go anywhere I want?

00:22:51.807 --> 00:22:52.807
Anywhere...

00:22:54.192 --> 00:22:55.216
Where do you like to go?

00:22:55.567 --> 00:22:56.567
I was just saying.

00:23:09.167 --> 00:23:09.768
(Is it heavy?)

00:23:09.928 --> 00:23:10.448
(Not heavy.)

00:23:10.968 --> 00:23:11.928
(Five kilos.)

00:23:12.607 --> 00:23:13.607
(Five kilos of water.)

00:23:13.607 --> 00:23:14.488
(Five kilos of water.)

00:23:14.488 --> 00:23:15.887
(Come on, show our friends.)

00:23:17.647 --> 00:23:19.208
(Look, five kilos of water.)

00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:20.887
(How's the trash bag quality?)

00:23:20.968 --> 00:23:22.288
(Pretty good, right?)

00:23:22.327 --> 00:23:23.407
(We're not lying to you.)

00:23:23.968 --> 00:23:27.288
(These bags come in extra-thick
and thin versions.)

00:23:27.488 --> 00:23:29.528
(But they're equally durable.)

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.367
(Braley joined the live stream)

00:23:32.367 --> 00:23:33.728
How much for four packs?

00:23:33.887 --> 00:23:35.208
9.9 yuan.

00:23:35.327 --> 00:23:36.208
Get ready to go on.

00:23:36.208 --> 00:23:37.127
Three, two, one.

00:23:37.127 --> 00:23:37.887
Attach the link!

00:23:37.928 --> 00:23:38.448
(Great.)

00:23:38.728 --> 00:23:39.847
(Thank you, guys.)

00:23:41.008 --> 00:23:42.288
(She's a notorious gold-digger,)

00:23:42.688 --> 00:23:43.807
(trying to marry the rich.)

00:23:47.728 --> 00:23:49.647
(That gold-digger streamer)

00:23:49.688 --> 00:23:50.887
(wants to marry a rich man.)

00:23:50.928 --> 00:23:51.728
(For real?)

00:23:53.688 --> 00:23:55.688
Some of you haven't followed yet?

00:23:55.968 --> 00:23:57.087
Just touch here to follow.

00:23:57.167 --> 00:23:58.008
See it?

00:23:58.008 --> 00:23:59.127
Just touch here.

00:23:59.248 --> 00:24:01.688
We'll send out a gift next, okay?

00:24:01.688 --> 00:24:02.248
Here it is.

00:24:02.248 --> 00:24:04.208
Thanks to our new viewers today.

00:24:04.248 --> 00:24:05.008
Thank you.

00:24:05.008 --> 00:24:06.448
(Got kicked out by the rich family?)

00:24:07.327 --> 00:24:08.008
(Interesting.)

00:24:08.167 --> 00:24:09.367
(Do a sad housewife act.)

00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:10.208
(No need to act.)

00:24:10.208 --> 00:24:11.728
(She is already selling trash bags.)

00:24:11.807 --> 00:24:12.928
(She is practically sad.)

00:24:13.008 --> 00:24:14.607
(She is an abandoned housewife.)

00:24:19.528 --> 00:24:21.248
(Why silent? Dance or we cancel orders.)
(Sing, and we'll buy 20.)

00:24:21.407 --> 00:24:23.087
(Sing and dance for 30 orders.)

00:24:23.087 --> 00:24:25.048
(Get yourself in the bag,
and we'll buy 40.)

00:24:25.448 --> 00:24:26.607
(Why isn't she talking?)

00:24:27.327 --> 00:24:28.248
(Even got thrown out.)

00:24:28.248 --> 00:24:29.327
(Watch your attitude!)

00:24:29.327 --> 00:24:30.647
(Dance, or we'll cancel orders.)

00:24:30.647 --> 00:24:31.847
(Gold-digger can't handle it.)

00:24:31.928 --> 00:24:32.567
(Return!)

00:24:35.127 --> 00:24:36.048
(Viewer Analytics)
(How come she's mute?)

00:24:36.288 --> 00:24:37.208
(She left.)
(Streamer froze.)

00:24:37.528 --> 00:24:38.248
(Gender, Age)
(She is over.)

00:24:38.367 --> 00:24:39.327
(Still silent?)

00:24:39.807 --> 00:24:40.887
Speak.

00:24:41.688 --> 00:24:42.607
Say something.

00:24:42.847 --> 00:24:43.607
What's wrong?

00:24:44.407 --> 00:24:46.087
Speak!

00:24:47.248 --> 00:24:48.087
(No one cheers.)

00:24:48.087 --> 00:24:48.528
Speak.

00:24:55.847 --> 00:24:57.968
Turn the AC low, please.

00:24:57.968 --> 00:24:58.807
It's sweltering.

00:24:59.607 --> 00:25:00.208
Got it.

00:25:00.448 --> 00:25:01.887
I just saw some viewers asking

00:25:02.327 --> 00:25:04.167
if this is big enough to fit a person.

00:25:04.407 --> 00:25:06.407
Type one
if you think it can fit someone.

00:25:06.688 --> 00:25:08.288
Type two if you disagree. Okay?

00:25:08.847 --> 00:25:09.847
Let's test out

00:25:09.847 --> 00:25:11.688
if this big trash bag can hold a person.

00:25:11.887 --> 00:25:12.847
Luo, help me.

00:25:13.688 --> 00:25:14.248
Okay.

00:25:15.367 --> 00:25:16.728
(Yes, some are typing one.)

00:25:16.728 --> 00:25:17.887
(There's quite a crowd.)

00:25:18.087 --> 00:25:19.887
Don't forget to follow us.

00:25:19.887 --> 00:25:20.968
Thank you.

00:25:22.327 --> 00:25:22.768
Alright.

00:25:22.768 --> 00:25:23.647
Let's check it out.

00:25:25.728 --> 00:25:28.048
The trash bags are extremely good.

00:25:28.127 --> 00:25:29.288
I suggest you

00:25:29.327 --> 00:25:30.647
go for the extra-thick version.

00:25:30.807 --> 00:25:33.008
(Because the extra-thick ones)

00:25:33.008 --> 00:25:34.167
(can handle any weight.)

00:25:35.008 --> 00:25:35.928
(Trust me.)

00:25:36.127 --> 00:25:36.847
(See?)

00:25:37.167 --> 00:25:38.647
(Okay, thanks.)

00:25:38.768 --> 00:25:39.688
(Thank you.)

00:25:39.887 --> 00:25:40.768
Guess how much damage

00:25:40.768 --> 00:25:42.728
you've caused me with this stream?

00:25:44.607 --> 00:25:46.928
Ignoring comments counts as an error.

00:25:47.728 --> 00:25:49.647
Just standing there for so long!

00:25:50.008 --> 00:25:52.127
Is this how you repay my trust?

00:25:54.167 --> 00:25:55.127
I'm sorry, Mr. Qiu.

00:25:55.647 --> 00:25:56.647
It won't happen again.

00:25:58.688 --> 00:26:00.127
And about the follower Warm Harbor,

00:26:00.847 --> 00:26:03.448
didn't I tell you to please
and retain any follower?

00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:06.167
But you met him offline once

00:26:06.407 --> 00:26:07.768
and made his account suspended.

00:26:08.327 --> 00:26:09.208
One follower less.

00:26:11.807 --> 00:26:12.928
Mr. Qiu, here's the thing.

00:26:13.567 --> 00:26:16.127
The person I met was actually a minor

00:26:16.607 --> 00:26:18.327
using his parent's phone for shopping.

00:26:19.208 --> 00:26:21.087
We can't profit from minors.

00:26:21.167 --> 00:26:22.528
So I persuaded him to...

00:26:23.928 --> 00:26:24.768
Enough.

00:26:25.607 --> 00:26:26.640
You always have reasons.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.784
Don't promote this product anymore.

00:26:28.928 --> 00:26:30.887
I'll schedule you
for an outdoor live stream.

00:26:34.567 --> 00:26:35.607
I'll do as you say.

00:26:36.768 --> 00:26:37.448
Or what?

00:26:38.448 --> 00:26:39.688
You're free to leave.

00:26:40.327 --> 00:26:41.048
I'll comply.

00:26:43.167 --> 00:26:44.807
Just leave if you don't.

00:26:45.887 --> 00:26:46.768
Thank you, Mr. Qiu.

00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:00.087
Yes.

00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:01.407
It's the 5th anniversary.

00:27:01.528 --> 00:27:02.367
Yes.

00:27:02.407 --> 00:27:03.567
These items are on sale.

00:27:03.647 --> 00:27:07.887
Today marks the 5th anniversary

00:27:08.327 --> 00:27:09.367
of Daxingfa Supermarket.

00:27:09.647 --> 00:27:10.968
That's why we've moved products

00:27:11.008 --> 00:27:12.288
to our live stream!

00:27:12.688 --> 00:27:13.488
Look at Link 1,

00:27:13.567 --> 00:27:14.887
the rapeseed oil.

00:27:14.928 --> 00:27:15.728
As I said,

00:27:15.728 --> 00:27:16.887
it's non-GMO, cold press,

00:27:17.008 --> 00:27:18.528
normally priced at 89.9 yuan.

00:27:18.528 --> 00:27:20.248
Today's special, 45.5 yuan!

00:27:20.248 --> 00:27:21.127
Get ready to go on.

00:27:21.127 --> 00:27:22.008
Three, two, one.

00:27:22.087 --> 00:27:23.008
Attach the link!

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:24.167
Listen, guys,

00:27:24.488 --> 00:27:26.087
our physical store is located

00:27:26.087 --> 00:27:29.288
at Jingzhou Cultural Park.

00:27:29.448 --> 00:27:30.928
Jingzhou Cultural Park.

00:27:31.087 --> 00:27:32.688
Right next to the ticket booth.

00:27:32.688 --> 00:27:35.367
It's crowded here, isn't it?

00:27:36.127 --> 00:27:37.248
But online,

00:27:37.448 --> 00:27:40.008
we offer the same great deals!

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.894
♪Ready to shine♪

00:27:44.488 --> 00:27:45.728
Recently,

00:27:45.728 --> 00:27:47.008
Amy has been acting up.

00:27:47.208 --> 00:27:47.887
Amy,

00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:48.607
be good.

00:27:48.607 --> 00:27:49.528
Maybe she's in heat?

00:27:49.807 --> 00:27:51.208
Puppies need mates too.

00:27:51.968 --> 00:27:52.887
Find her a match.

00:27:53.008 --> 00:27:53.528
Sure,

00:27:53.768 --> 00:27:54.728
I'll arrange one.

00:27:55.127 --> 00:27:55.847
Forget it.

00:27:56.208 --> 00:27:59.448
Yan just started Financial News, right?

00:28:00.208 --> 00:28:01.327
She was doing well.

00:28:01.768 --> 00:28:03.288
Why quit suddenly?

00:28:04.127 --> 00:28:06.407
Yan has always been decisive.

00:28:06.807 --> 00:28:09.248
She wants to start a business.
Our whole family supports her.

00:28:11.167 --> 00:28:12.928
Being a news anchor brings fame

00:28:12.928 --> 00:28:13.928
and influence.

00:28:14.288 --> 00:28:15.728
Why start up a business?

00:28:16.167 --> 00:28:18.048
We've seen enough
struggling entrepreneurs.

00:28:18.407 --> 00:28:19.768
Sounds good,

00:28:19.847 --> 00:28:21.528
but they have to suffer a lot.

00:28:22.688 --> 00:28:24.728
It'll be hard to see Ms. Xu, right?

00:28:24.928 --> 00:28:26.488
I'm even starting to miss her.

00:28:29.087 --> 00:28:29.807
Ms. Yu.

00:28:32.367 --> 00:28:33.127
Ms. Meng.

Ms. Ma.

00:28:34.528 --> 00:28:35.288
Ms. Sun.

00:28:35.367 --> 00:28:36.127
How are you?

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:36.968
Lei.

00:28:36.968 --> 00:28:38.048
What brings you here today?

00:28:39.528 --> 00:28:40.847
There's an excellent event.

00:28:41.327 --> 00:28:44.008
I'd like to invite you all
to go with me.

00:29:01.448 --> 00:29:01.928
Great!

00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:03.607
Open.

00:29:09.887 --> 00:29:10.647
Awesome!

00:29:11.647 --> 00:29:12.327
Impressive!

00:29:13.008 --> 00:29:14.087
What is this place?

00:29:15.728 --> 00:29:16.528
Why brought us here?

00:29:16.528 --> 00:29:17.127
Lei.

00:29:17.728 --> 00:29:18.928
Why did you bring us here?

00:29:18.968 --> 00:29:20.288
What kind of event could be here?

00:29:20.807 --> 00:29:22.127
Let's go check it out.

00:29:22.887 --> 00:29:23.728
Why come here?

00:29:23.968 --> 00:29:24.688
I don't know.

00:29:30.488 --> 00:29:32.008
Restock inventory.

00:29:32.208 --> 00:29:33.407
Rapeseed oil. We'll skip this.

00:29:33.407 --> 00:29:35.407
Let me show you beef balls, okay?

00:29:35.407 --> 00:29:36.647
What you see is what you get.

00:29:36.647 --> 00:29:38.167
Hand-made beef balls.

00:29:38.327 --> 00:29:39.008
Today,

00:29:39.008 --> 00:29:40.127
we're offering a great deal.

00:29:40.208 --> 00:29:41.087
It's a bargain!

00:29:41.167 --> 00:29:43.127
It only costs you 29.9.

00:29:43.208 --> 00:29:43.728
Lan.

00:29:43.728 --> 00:29:45.847
- One, two, and three packs.
- Am I seeing things?

00:29:47.208 --> 00:29:50.008
Is that girl Yan?

00:29:52.048 --> 00:29:55.208
Is that what she started?

00:29:55.208 --> 00:29:56.448
498 yuan.

00:29:57.008 --> 00:29:58.488

00:29:58.647 --> 00:30:00.768

00:30:00.768 --> 00:30:03.288

00:30:09.327 --> 00:30:11.127
Did you bring us here to watch this?

00:30:12.968 --> 00:30:13.887
Of course not.

00:30:14.367 --> 00:30:17.448
I saw online
that Yan was hosting an event here.

00:30:17.688 --> 00:30:19.928
Didn't you all miss her?

00:30:20.928 --> 00:30:23.208
I just wanted us to check it out.

00:30:23.607 --> 00:30:25.928
Never imagined she'd be doing this.

00:30:26.567 --> 00:30:27.807
Choose any cookware, alright?

00:30:27.968 --> 00:30:29.728
Let me show you that pan.

00:30:29.807 --> 00:30:31.448

order now!

00:31:00.607 --> 00:31:01.127
Springy!

00:31:01.127 --> 00:31:01.728
Ms. Yu.

00:31:02.288 --> 00:31:04.607
What's going on here?

00:31:04.647 --> 00:31:06.407
Ms. Xu wants to know each step
of a business?

00:31:07.127 --> 00:31:08.248
Even so,

00:31:08.488 --> 00:31:11.208
she shouldn't toil outdoors like this.

00:31:11.807 --> 00:31:13.208
Look at the environment.

00:31:13.367 --> 00:31:14.407
It's terrible!

00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:18.488
You should stop her.

00:31:19.327 --> 00:31:23.528
She is your daughter-in-law,
but now she's selling rice and eggs?

00:31:24.488 --> 00:31:25.887
So degrading!

00:31:26.488 --> 00:31:28.048
It makes people look down on her.

00:31:29.728 --> 00:31:31.607
Yes, the handmade beef balls

00:31:31.607 --> 00:31:32.807
are super springy!

00:31:33.647 --> 00:31:36.008
Perfect for hotpot, barbecue, or frying.

00:31:36.008 --> 00:31:37.127
Very versatile, right?

00:31:37.208 --> 00:31:38.567
Link 2! Link 2!

00:31:38.607 --> 00:31:39.928
Backend team, get ready.

00:31:40.048 --> 00:31:40.768
Link 2.

00:31:41.288 --> 00:31:42.528
Get Link 2 ready.

00:31:42.688 --> 00:31:43.167
Got it.

00:31:43.167 --> 00:31:44.407
Pass me the rice.

00:31:45.528 --> 00:31:47.127
Degrading?

00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:51.367
Who's looking down on her?

00:31:56.048 --> 00:31:57.167
She is willing to work hard,

00:31:57.208 --> 00:31:58.488
starting from the bottom.

00:31:58.728 --> 00:31:59.728
Nothing wrong with that.

00:32:00.488 --> 00:32:01.208
Ms. Meng.

00:32:01.567 --> 00:32:05.087
Didn't you sleep in warehouses
when building your factory?

00:32:06.647 --> 00:32:07.327
Ms. Ma.

00:32:08.528 --> 00:32:10.248
Shouldn't entrepreneurs
endure hardships?

00:32:10.688 --> 00:32:11.647
Speaking of environment,

00:32:12.688 --> 00:32:14.847
you started with a cement plant.

00:32:14.887 --> 00:32:15.647
When we met you,

00:32:15.647 --> 00:32:17.607
you were always covered in cement

00:32:17.607 --> 00:32:18.647
and dust.

00:32:19.327 --> 00:32:19.928
Remember?

00:32:24.807 --> 00:32:26.167
Don't look at me.

00:32:26.367 --> 00:32:28.567
My husband and I
used to sell braised meat.

00:32:28.847 --> 00:32:30.087
We used demolition compensation

00:32:30.087 --> 00:32:32.008
to start a business and got rich.

00:32:32.248 --> 00:32:33.167
We're a parvenu.

00:32:33.488 --> 00:32:34.647
20 years ago,

00:32:35.768 --> 00:32:37.288
we were all ordinary people.

00:32:38.288 --> 00:32:40.847
Our ancestors were all farmers too.

00:32:41.208 --> 00:32:43.407
I was just a contractor's wife.

00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:47.288
When my husband was understaffed,
I even cooked for his staff.

00:32:48.407 --> 00:32:49.167
Sounds degrading?

00:32:51.807 --> 00:32:53.528
We just got rich.

00:32:53.607 --> 00:32:54.567
You forgot your past?

00:32:56.167 --> 00:32:57.208
Let's call it a day.

00:33:02.087 --> 00:33:03.488
Alright, pass me that rice too.

00:33:05.807 --> 00:33:06.327
Yes.

00:33:06.407 --> 00:33:07.847
This rice...

00:33:14.968 --> 00:33:17.288
It's our latest product.

00:33:17.807 --> 00:33:20.928
So, just purchase it if you like.

00:33:22.807 --> 00:33:24.048
We also have flour.

00:33:24.208 --> 00:33:25.448
Let me show you.

00:33:25.567 --> 00:33:26.807
Both rice and flour

00:33:27.087 --> 00:33:28.887
are available for you.

00:33:29.167 --> 00:33:30.847

00:33:32.407 --> 00:33:32.968

Yes, Link 2.

00:33:40.768 --> 00:33:41.327
Liu,

00:33:41.928 --> 00:33:42.928
don't leave. Stay awhile.

00:33:43.567 --> 00:33:44.087
Got it.

00:33:58.127 --> 00:34:00.488
We currently have many great deals here.

00:34:00.488 --> 00:34:01.008
Just today,

00:34:01.008 --> 00:34:02.528
you buy two and get one free.

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:04.248
For oil purchases,

00:34:04.327 --> 00:34:06.288
we're giving out cookware sets.

00:34:06.367 --> 00:34:08.528
These pans normally sell for 498.

00:34:08.647 --> 00:34:10.488
Today we're giving them away for free!

00:34:10.607 --> 00:34:11.808
Now look at these beef balls.

00:34:11.968 --> 00:34:13.567
Someone just asked about chicken feet.

00:34:13.687 --> 00:34:14.607
We have chicken feet.

00:34:14.607 --> 00:34:15.448
Yes, it's available.

00:34:15.448 --> 00:34:17.167
It's in Link 6, okay?

00:34:17.167 --> 00:34:19.087
We'll notify you of its promotion.

00:34:19.087 --> 00:34:19.968
Excuse me, sir.

00:34:19.968 --> 00:34:20.448
Yes?

00:34:20.448 --> 00:34:22.888
Give me 100 packs of rice, flour,
and oil respectively.

00:34:22.888 --> 00:34:24.008
100? That's a lot!

00:34:24.167 --> 00:34:26.687
My boss wants to give employee benefits.

00:34:26.888 --> 00:34:27.448
Okay.

00:34:27.567 --> 00:34:28.328
Backend team,

00:34:28.368 --> 00:34:29.968
100 packs of each.

00:34:29.968 --> 00:34:30.368
Correct.

00:34:30.408 --> 00:34:31.167
Place the order.

00:34:31.247 --> 00:34:32.207
Ordering so many?

00:34:33.048 --> 00:34:33.647
Sir.

00:34:33.808 --> 00:34:34.408
Sir.

00:34:34.488 --> 00:34:34.848
Yes?

00:34:34.848 --> 00:34:37.167
Miss, give me 100 sets of everything.

00:34:37.167 --> 00:34:38.528
I'll send the address later.

00:34:38.607 --> 00:34:39.127
Got it!

00:34:39.207 --> 00:34:39.928
100 again!

00:34:40.767 --> 00:34:41.368
Ms. Xu.

00:34:43.368 --> 00:34:43.928

00:34:44.008 --> 00:34:45.767

00:34:48.167 --> 00:34:49.167
I want a pan.

00:34:49.567 --> 00:34:50.287

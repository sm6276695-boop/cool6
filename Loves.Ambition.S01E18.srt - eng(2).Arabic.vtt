Sit here.

00:02:01.944 --> 00:02:03.423
An incognito visit?

00:02:08.304 --> 00:02:08.744
Well,

00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:09.744
that outdoor event

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:11.264
was a huge success.

00:02:11.503 --> 00:02:12.543
The clients loved it.

00:02:14.663 --> 00:02:17.103
Why didn't you mention

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:18.744
your influence at all?

00:02:22.063 --> 00:02:24.103
I know who your mother-in-law is.

00:02:25.264 --> 00:02:26.584
With your ability,

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:29.063
you could ask her
to promote our products.

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:32.904
I'll assign you
our luxury women's fashion brands.

00:02:33.584 --> 00:02:37.304
As long as your mother-in-law
and her CEO friends

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:38.704
wear our clothes on camera,

00:02:38.864 --> 00:02:39.864
our sales

00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:41.343

Sorry, Mr. Qiu.

00:02:44.223 --> 00:02:45.063
It's not appropriate.

00:02:46.783 --> 00:02:48.024
Well, I understand.

00:02:48.343 --> 00:02:49.343
They can't show up, huh?

00:02:50.223 --> 00:02:51.223
But you can do it.

Fine.

00:03:25.464 --> 00:03:26.184

Could you...?

you're really talented in design.

Don't be discouraged.

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:46.264
One contest doesn't mean much.

00:07:46.584 --> 00:07:47.743
You'll do better next time.

00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:51.504
You already did great.

00:07:51.543 --> 00:07:53.343
That was a national contest.

00:07:53.343 --> 00:07:54.343

00:07:55.144 --> 00:07:55.904

Don't lose hope.

00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:01.904
Just work harder

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:03.423
and try again.

00:08:04.064 --> 00:08:04.584
Exactly.

00:08:04.783 --> 00:08:08.423
I noticed your sketches and final pieces
weren't fully matched.

00:08:08.584 --> 00:08:10.103
Many accessories missing.

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:11.983
If it's due to time constraints,

00:08:12.103 --> 00:08:13.624
you'll do better next time

00:08:13.624 --> 00:08:14.504
with enough time.

00:08:15.584 --> 00:08:16.663
It's not about time.

00:08:18.423 --> 00:08:19.223
It's about money.

00:08:27.103 --> 00:08:29.863
Fashion design burns money.

00:08:30.464 --> 00:08:31.663
Fabric's expensive,

00:08:31.743 --> 00:08:33.024
and accessories too.

00:08:34.183 --> 00:08:36.504
Hiring models, shooting photos,
all cost.

00:08:40.303 --> 00:08:41.423
When I delivered takeout,

00:08:41.423 --> 00:08:42.264
I kept thinking

00:08:43.504 --> 00:08:45.823
that after 100 orders

00:08:46.224 --> 00:08:48.303
I'll buy those fabrics.

00:08:48.624 --> 00:08:51.024
After 500

00:08:51.344 --> 00:08:53.423
I'll afford those buttons.

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.344
People said I was dreaming,

00:09:01.104 --> 00:09:01.984
but I didn't care.

00:09:07.104 --> 00:09:10.264
After I finally saved up and entered,
I realized

00:09:11.703 --> 00:09:14.463
the costs would keep ballooning.

00:09:17.904 --> 00:09:19.224
Soon

00:09:20.864 --> 00:09:22.463
I can't even afford fabric.

00:09:26.624 --> 00:09:27.423
It's the truth.

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:29.504
With my salary,

00:09:30.504 --> 00:09:31.583

00:09:31.783 --> 00:09:33.144

00:09:33.303 --> 00:09:34.943
nothing's left.

00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:37.423
Earn and spend right away.

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:38.943
Not a cent saved.

00:09:39.583 --> 00:09:41.864
People like us,

00:09:41.904 --> 00:09:43.224
shouldn't dream too big.

00:09:43.663 --> 00:09:46.183
Well... Just

00:09:46.423 --> 00:09:47.183
making ends meet

00:09:47.183 --> 00:09:48.423
is hard.

00:09:48.943 --> 00:09:49.463
Yao.

00:09:49.783 --> 00:09:52.543
Not everyone's dreams can come true.

00:09:52.783 --> 00:09:54.243
You can still design.

00:09:54.243 --> 00:09:55.224
Take it as a hobby.

00:09:55.823 --> 00:09:57.543
Don't push yourself so hard.

00:10:00.864 --> 00:10:01.423
No.

00:10:01.663 --> 00:10:02.744
No. No way.

00:10:02.984 --> 00:10:04.063
Like the movie says,

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:06.344
without dreams, we're just salted fish.

00:10:08.183 --> 00:10:09.823
If 500 orders aren't enough,

00:10:10.104 --> 00:10:12.303
let's push for 600.

00:10:12.423 --> 00:10:14.183
We'll save enough.

00:10:14.264 --> 00:10:16.104
Just try it.

00:10:18.583 --> 00:10:20.423
It's so kind of you saying that.

00:10:22.423 --> 00:10:23.144
Alright.

00:10:23.783 --> 00:10:24.703
I've calculated.

00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:29.543
By the time I'm 120,
I'll have saved enough.

00:10:46.663 --> 00:10:47.984
Something on your mind?

00:10:53.144 --> 00:10:55.463
Seeing Guan just now

00:10:57.063 --> 00:10:59.864
reminded me
of my first years in Jingzhou.

00:11:00.663 --> 00:11:01.744
Just like them,

00:11:02.984 --> 00:11:04.904
I run around

00:11:06.463 --> 00:11:07.463
for survive.

00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:10.504
I was terrified

00:11:10.904 --> 00:11:13.783
one wrong move would cost me the city.

00:11:15.783 --> 00:11:21.823
So I desperately sought security.

00:11:28.264 --> 00:11:28.943
I know

00:11:31.264 --> 00:11:32.984
my way was wrong.

00:11:35.943 --> 00:11:37.943
But my goal wasn't.

00:11:39.624 --> 00:11:41.543
Wanting a quality life,

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.943
creating better material condition
for my family,

00:11:50.183 --> 00:11:51.783
and changing my fate

00:11:54.943 --> 00:11:56.423
are not vanity.

00:11:58.703 --> 00:11:59.423
Of course.

00:12:00.104 --> 00:12:01.144
You're right.

00:12:02.224 --> 00:12:05.224
So we've got to work hard

00:12:05.504 --> 00:12:06.423
and to earn money.

00:12:08.583 --> 00:12:09.823
Living really costs.

00:12:18.183 --> 00:12:19.144
I want to try.

00:12:22.104 --> 00:12:22.583
What?

00:12:23.183 --> 00:12:23.864
You want to try?

00:12:24.463 --> 00:12:25.144
Try what?

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:32.423
Paper copy's here.

00:12:32.703 --> 00:12:34.104
E-copy has been sent to your email.

00:12:35.024 --> 00:12:35.583
Thanks.

00:12:56.104 --> 00:12:56.703
Mr. Zhang.

00:12:59.423 --> 00:13:00.823
What's the plan now?

00:13:04.663 --> 00:13:06.024
Since I dared give it to him,

00:13:06.344 --> 00:13:08.104
there's nothing he can find.

00:13:11.344 --> 00:13:14.183
When Wang Defu comes back,

00:13:14.463 --> 00:13:17.624
inform him
about the headquarters' inspection team.

00:13:17.904 --> 00:13:18.543
Clever.

00:13:19.224 --> 00:13:21.044
Mr. Wu from Anqiang
ran off with his money.

00:13:21.144 --> 00:13:22.583
He's been trying to get it back.

00:13:23.144 --> 00:13:24.063
Let me tell you.

00:13:24.344 --> 00:13:26.104
That guy's trouble.

00:13:26.504 --> 00:13:27.063
Right.

00:13:27.624 --> 00:13:29.744
This is how we'll force him out.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:34.583
Mr. Shen.

00:13:34.864 --> 00:13:36.752
We just started
and they came causing trouble,

00:13:36.752 --> 00:13:37.840
preventing us from working.

00:13:38.024 --> 00:13:38.904
We tried reasoning,

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:39.984
but they turned violent.

00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:43.264
Stop! Stop!

00:13:44.024 --> 00:13:44.583
Stop!

00:13:46.344 --> 00:13:47.144
What's going on?

00:13:47.904 --> 00:13:49.063
You're Mr. Shen, right?

00:13:53.943 --> 00:13:55.144
Let me introduce myself.

00:13:55.344 --> 00:13:55.904
I'm

00:13:56.183 --> 00:13:56.864
Wang Defu.

00:13:57.063 --> 00:13:58.583
Defu, as in 'virtue wins'.

00:13:58.943 --> 00:14:02.224
I heard you're here
to solve our problems.

00:14:02.303 --> 00:14:02.984
That's perfect.

00:14:03.303 --> 00:14:05.063
Jinda Group owes me six million.

00:14:05.423 --> 00:14:06.303
Pay up now.

00:14:06.823 --> 00:14:08.583
If I'm not mistaken,

00:14:09.024 --> 00:14:12.584
it was Wu Chengming from Anqiang

00:14:13.072 --> 00:14:15.423
who pulled you into this project, right?

00:14:15.744 --> 00:14:16.344
Exactly.

00:14:17.024 --> 00:14:18.624
It was a personal loan.

00:14:18.904 --> 00:14:20.543
Your loan agreement

00:14:20.984 --> 00:14:24.703
is between Anqiang Group and you.

00:14:24.904 --> 00:14:25.984
If you want repayment,

00:14:26.663 --> 00:14:28.904
go to Wu Chengming,

00:14:29.063 --> 00:14:30.063
not Jinda Group.

00:14:30.823 --> 00:14:33.663
Besides, police are already involved.

00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:38.303
He conned me using your project.

00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:40.423
Without Jinda Group's backing,

00:14:40.663 --> 00:14:42.104
he'd never dare make such claims.

00:14:42.224 --> 00:14:44.624
Would I have lent six million so easily?

00:14:45.024 --> 00:14:47.504
Now Wu's vanished,

00:14:47.663 --> 00:14:49.183
and you want to deny responsibility?

00:14:49.543 --> 00:14:50.783
The police?

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.744
Even the courts

00:14:52.984 --> 00:14:54.104
won't side with you.

00:14:54.344 --> 00:14:54.943
Pay up.

00:14:55.104 --> 00:14:56.783
By law,

00:14:57.663 --> 00:15:00.943
Jinda Group is not
on the hook, jointly or otherwise.

00:15:01.303 --> 00:15:02.423
Similar cases

00:15:02.703 --> 00:15:05.104
with identical circumstances

00:15:05.543 --> 00:15:06.943
have already been ruled that way.

00:15:07.144 --> 00:15:08.183
You can check

00:15:08.504 --> 00:15:09.943
or consult your lawyer.

00:15:10.583 --> 00:15:11.543
Lawyer?

00:15:12.024 --> 00:15:13.423
Debts must be paid.

00:15:14.264 --> 00:15:15.144
That's natural law.

00:15:15.864 --> 00:15:16.703
Right, guys?

00:15:16.744 --> 00:15:17.663
Yes.

00:15:17.744 --> 00:15:18.583
- Right!
- Pay up!

00:15:18.864 --> 00:15:19.792
What are you doing?

00:15:23.183 --> 00:15:23.783
Don't move!

00:15:24.703 --> 00:15:25.264
Pay up!

00:15:25.783 --> 00:15:26.303
Pay up!

00:15:28.583 --> 00:15:29.583
I've told you.

00:15:30.943 --> 00:15:31.823
Don't be so rude.

00:15:32.384 --> 00:15:33.423
Rule with virtue.

00:15:34.783 --> 00:15:35.423
(Get well soon)
This is a lesson.

00:15:35.663 --> 00:15:37.024
Yes, indeed!

00:15:38.024 --> 00:15:38.744
Mr. Shen,

00:15:39.264 --> 00:15:40.583
you're so rich,

00:15:40.624 --> 00:15:41.783
swimming in cash.

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.624
But we ordinary folks
have to work hard to earn.

00:15:44.984 --> 00:15:46.144
If you want to bully us,

00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:47.224
that won't be easy.

00:15:47.904 --> 00:15:48.984
We're locals here.

00:15:49.463 --> 00:15:50.904
We have plenty of time.

00:15:51.823 --> 00:15:52.624
No money today?

00:15:53.303 --> 00:15:54.423
We'll be back tomorrow.

00:15:54.703 --> 00:15:56.224
No tomorrow? Then the day after.

00:15:56.504 --> 00:15:57.823
We'll see who cracks first.

00:15:58.303 --> 00:15:59.744
I'll give you some face today.

00:15:59.943 --> 00:16:00.744
We're leaving.

00:16:00.984 --> 00:16:01.423
Let's go.

00:16:02.344 --> 00:16:02.783
Go away.

00:16:12.624 --> 00:16:13.463
Clean up.

00:16:13.624 --> 00:16:14.264
Get to work.

00:16:14.423 --> 00:16:14.943
- Back to work.
- Yes.

00:16:14.984 --> 00:16:15.744
Time to work.

00:16:15.943 --> 00:16:16.504
Begin!

00:16:21.624 --> 00:16:23.024
Let's see

00:16:23.144 --> 00:16:24.744
how a rich guy fights thugs.

00:16:25.744 --> 00:16:26.423
Right.

00:16:26.783 --> 00:16:27.984
Let him learn

00:16:28.183 --> 00:16:30.024
this water runs deeper than it looks.

00:16:30.183 --> 00:16:31.224
Wherever he came from,

00:16:31.344 --> 00:16:32.504
he'd better go back.

00:16:35.663 --> 00:16:36.144
Xu Yan.

00:16:36.543 --> 00:16:38.344
Why'd you call us here?

00:16:40.463 --> 00:16:42.183
My sister's got a startup idea,

00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:43.864
and you're all part of it.

00:16:45.543 --> 00:16:46.183
Startup?

00:16:50.624 --> 00:16:51.144
Yes.

00:16:52.024 --> 00:16:53.423
I've been thinking.

00:16:53.663 --> 00:16:56.823
We can combine our strengths.

00:16:57.543 --> 00:17:01.543
Yao can handle design
with an ethnic focus,

00:17:01.783 --> 00:17:04.104
Guan can be our brand ambassador,

00:17:04.663 --> 00:17:07.784
and my sister handles styling.

00:17:08.463 --> 00:17:10.703
Let's launch a clothing brand together.

00:17:11.423 --> 00:17:12.824
In the initial phase,

00:17:12.904 --> 00:17:17.904
we'll build exposure and our image

00:17:17.904 --> 00:17:19.344
with short videos.

00:17:19.784 --> 00:17:22.544
Later, we'll open stores

00:17:22.904 --> 00:17:24.703
and sell ready-to-wear.

00:17:27.864 --> 00:17:28.943
What do you think?

00:17:32.144 --> 00:17:32.864
Yan.

00:17:33.423 --> 00:17:35.223
It sounds great,

00:17:36.463 --> 00:17:39.943
but starting a business is tough.

00:17:40.743 --> 00:17:41.983
Take me.

00:17:42.344 --> 00:17:44.624
I poured everything
into that competition.

00:17:44.743 --> 00:17:45.423
And now?

00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:47.344
I got nothing back.

00:17:47.703 --> 00:17:48.344
Exactly.

00:17:48.624 --> 00:17:50.743
My job doesn't pay much now,

00:17:51.023 --> 00:17:51.983
but it's steady.

00:17:53.503 --> 00:17:55.064
If our business plan failed,

00:17:55.423 --> 00:17:56.344
how do we live?

00:17:57.824 --> 00:17:59.983
Besides, we lack startup fund.

00:18:00.344 --> 00:18:01.023
True.

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.943
Here's my savings,

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:07.584
150,000 yuan.

00:18:07.943 --> 00:18:09.544
This'll be our startup fund.

00:18:10.584 --> 00:18:13.183
And I'll bring in investors later.

00:18:13.223 --> 00:18:14.663
Our funds will be more than this.

00:18:16.344 --> 00:18:16.663
If...

00:18:17.304 --> 00:18:19.503
If this fails,

00:18:19.544 --> 00:18:20.743
all your money will go.

00:18:21.104 --> 00:18:22.223
Are you sure about this?

00:18:22.304 --> 00:18:23.663
I'm quite sure.

00:18:25.183 --> 00:18:26.703
This isn't impulsive.

00:18:29.423 --> 00:18:30.544
Trust me.

00:18:33.784 --> 00:18:35.223
Now I just want to ask.

00:18:35.344 --> 00:18:39.104
Are you confident in your skills?

00:18:40.064 --> 00:18:40.743
Absolutely.

00:18:41.104 --> 00:18:41.703
I've always

00:18:41.784 --> 00:18:44.904
wanted to show our ethnic clothes
to more.

and people are still copying them!

00:18:58.943 --> 00:19:01.384

Yes. I need.

00:19:44.864 --> 00:19:47.864
I need to quit my job first.

00:26:52.104 --> 00:26:53.144
We start it from scratch,

00:26:53.463 --> 00:26:54.344
so we are quite busy.

00:26:55.223 --> 00:26:56.463
But I quite enjoy it.

00:26:57.864 --> 00:26:58.703
Good then.

00:26:59.824 --> 00:27:01.104
Whatever you do, just enjoy it.

00:27:07.503 --> 00:27:08.904
Your teacher told me

00:27:10.064 --> 00:27:11.423
you've kept up with school.

00:27:12.304 --> 00:27:13.503
Be attentive in class.

00:27:14.584 --> 00:27:15.624
Done your homework well.

00:27:17.584 --> 00:27:20.144
You've been contacting my teacher?

00:27:30.223 --> 00:27:31.304
Don't you think

00:27:31.423 --> 00:27:35.144
this outfit's pattern is too formal?

00:27:35.983 --> 00:27:36.824
The overall vibe

00:27:36.864 --> 00:27:38.263
looks so rigid.

00:27:38.784 --> 00:27:41.144
Dr. Yu brought you yogurt.

00:27:47.624 --> 00:27:48.104
Drink up.

00:27:57.544 --> 00:27:58.304
What...

00:27:58.423 --> 00:27:59.144
What's wrong?

00:27:59.183 --> 00:28:00.344
Why so gloomy?

00:28:01.983 --> 00:28:03.104
Followers increased.

00:28:03.144 --> 00:28:03.784
Increased?

00:28:03.824 --> 00:28:04.663
Let me check.

00:28:07.584 --> 00:28:08.183
We have

00:28:08.663 --> 00:28:09.503
eleven more.

00:28:14.624 --> 00:28:15.503
That's something!

00:28:15.743 --> 00:28:17.023
Better than nothing.

00:28:17.064 --> 00:28:17.463
Right?

00:28:18.144 --> 00:28:18.743
It's okay.

00:28:20.904 --> 00:28:24.144
We must admit Yan Studio has a problem.

00:28:28.743 --> 00:28:31.223
There's a British brand,

00:28:31.784 --> 00:28:33.463
Ladysee, ever heard of it?

00:28:35.423 --> 00:28:36.423
This brand

00:28:36.784 --> 00:28:40.064
focuses on medieval maiden style.

00:28:41.624 --> 00:28:45.703
The tone of the brand is elegant,

00:28:45.824 --> 00:28:46.624
exquisite,

00:28:46.943 --> 00:28:47.743
and fantasy-like.

00:28:48.784 --> 00:28:49.703
My research shows

00:28:51.423 --> 00:28:52.864
(Welcome to Ladysee's fashion realm)
the brand is niche,

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:54.584
so the early sales were poor.

00:28:55.584 --> 00:28:57.983
But why did it later sweep Europe?

00:28:58.904 --> 00:29:01.183
During the London Olympics,

00:29:01.463 --> 00:29:03.423
it merged with a sports brand,

00:29:03.584 --> 00:29:05.904
blending classical elements

00:29:06.584 --> 00:29:09.503
and making athletic wear elegant,

00:29:09.743 --> 00:29:11.703
with girlish charm and unique style.

00:29:13.663 --> 00:29:16.144
It skyrocketed
local girls' purchasing desire.

00:29:19.904 --> 00:29:21.223
So, I was thinking

00:29:22.663 --> 00:29:24.223
if our current videos

00:29:24.263 --> 00:29:27.023
are overemphasizing ethnic styles.

00:29:29.344 --> 00:29:33.904
Our brand philosophy aims
to preserve and develop traditions.

00:29:34.344 --> 00:29:39.463
Therefore, we should make
ethnic-style clothing more appealing.

00:29:40.423 --> 00:29:46.023
We should highlight functionality
and mass appeal in our products.

00:29:46.423 --> 00:29:47.423
For example.

00:29:47.864 --> 00:29:49.344
When going on an outing,

00:29:50.864 --> 00:29:52.503
I could wear Yan Studio's clothes,

00:29:53.183 --> 00:29:55.104
feeling free and joyful.

00:29:55.584 --> 00:29:57.864
When going to work,

00:29:58.064 --> 00:29:59.983
I could also choose
Yan Studio's clothes.

00:30:00.344 --> 00:30:01.624
When going to wedding,

00:30:02.423 --> 00:30:03.023
or parties...

00:30:05.584 --> 00:30:06.544
Do you understand me?

00:30:07.624 --> 00:30:09.304
I think this direction is spot-on.

00:30:09.584 --> 00:30:11.423
If we follow Yan's suggestions,

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:13.144
I have a preliminary concept.

00:30:13.463 --> 00:30:15.183
For our next video,

00:30:15.223 --> 00:30:19.304
could we include topics
like Normal Outfit of the Day?

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:20.624
Normal Outfit of the Day?

00:30:21.904 --> 00:30:25.463
Then we can dial
everything down to real-life mode.

00:30:25.544 --> 00:30:27.824
So as the makeup style.

00:30:28.423 --> 00:30:32.423
Then I'll appear
more relaxed and natural

00:30:32.663 --> 00:30:33.423
during filming.

00:30:35.584 --> 00:30:36.824
No problem. Let's do this.

00:30:37.183 --> 00:30:38.743
We'll adjust and integrate it

00:30:39.104 --> 00:30:40.584
into our next collection.

00:30:40.584 --> 00:30:41.663
- Sure.
- Agreed.

00:30:42.824 --> 00:30:43.983
I'll send you the plan later.

00:30:44.144 --> 00:30:44.503
Okay.

00:30:44.584 --> 00:30:45.784
I'm going back.

00:30:45.864 --> 00:30:46.864
I'll revise the schedule.

00:30:47.743 --> 00:30:48.183
Go ahead.

00:30:49.144 --> 00:30:49.864
I'll take this.

00:30:52.904 --> 00:30:54.104
I'll see your video.

00:30:56.703 --> 00:30:57.423
(Hello, everyone!)

00:30:57.503 --> 00:30:59.503
(Welcome to today's live stream!)

00:30:59.663 --> 00:31:01.943
(Don't miss out, everyone!)

00:31:02.023 --> 00:31:03.703
(Please stay with us!)

00:31:03.784 --> 00:31:04.983
(Today, we have prepared)

00:31:05.023 --> 00:31:07.104
(amazing benefits for you.)

00:31:07.263 --> 00:31:09.423
(Including the...)

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:20.202
(Xu Yan)

00:31:20.364 --> 00:31:23.448
(Don't forget. 8th next month
at Civil Affairs Bureau.)

00:31:32.624 --> 00:31:33.263
Mr. Shen!

00:31:36.304 --> 00:31:37.304
A batch of pipes is here.

00:31:37.304 --> 00:31:38.423
Come to inspect.

00:31:39.304 --> 00:31:39.784
Okay.

00:31:43.864 --> 00:31:45.183
You did wrong in this position.

00:31:45.743 --> 00:31:46.983
Tighten quality control here

00:31:47.463 --> 00:31:48.864
and correct this.

00:31:48.904 --> 00:31:49.263
Got it.

00:31:49.463 --> 00:31:49.824
Okay?

00:31:50.864 --> 00:31:51.544
You can leave.

00:31:51.624 --> 00:31:51.983
Okay.

00:31:54.544 --> 00:31:55.064
Hello.

00:31:55.784 --> 00:31:57.703
Mr. Shen, update you.

00:31:58.064 --> 00:31:59.423
Operations are running smoothly.

00:31:59.703 --> 00:32:00.904
How's Xu Yan doing?

00:32:01.584 --> 00:32:03.304
Yan is busy starting her business.

00:32:03.423 --> 00:32:05.064
Doesn't she livestream?

00:32:05.983 --> 00:32:07.423
She quit.

00:32:08.023 --> 00:32:11.023
Now she runs an ethnic fashion account

00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:13.023
with her sister and two others girls.

00:32:13.023 --> 00:32:13.904
How's it?

00:32:15.304 --> 00:32:16.064
Not great.

00:32:16.544 --> 00:32:17.624
A few hundred followers

00:32:18.304 --> 00:32:19.743
and under thousand likes per post.

00:32:20.423 --> 00:32:21.144
Right, Mr. Shen,

00:32:21.663 --> 00:32:23.144
Wang Defu's profile you requested

00:32:23.663 --> 00:32:25.344
was sent to your email.

00:32:25.344 --> 00:32:25.864
Got it.

00:32:31.144 --> 00:32:31.784
Bro,

00:32:32.064 --> 00:32:34.544
will Mr. Shen give us the money?

00:32:35.663 --> 00:32:36.743
If he refuses,

00:32:36.983 --> 00:32:38.144
I'll go to his father.

00:32:38.864 --> 00:32:39.423
Right.

00:33:16.663 --> 00:33:17.423
May I sit here?

00:33:21.223 --> 00:33:21.703
Sit.

00:33:34.864 --> 00:33:35.544
Shen Haoming.

00:33:36.023 --> 00:33:37.263
You're interesting.

00:33:38.864 --> 00:33:40.423
I didn't come to you today,

00:33:41.183 --> 00:33:42.503
yet you came to me.

00:33:43.864 --> 00:33:44.503
What's wrong?

00:33:45.104 --> 00:33:46.023
Can't handle it?

00:33:46.943 --> 00:33:48.023
Pay up now,

00:33:48.423 --> 00:33:49.463
principal plus interest.

00:33:49.663 --> 00:33:50.223
Make it quick.

00:33:51.423 --> 00:33:54.223
I came to you to discuss repayment.

00:33:55.463 --> 00:33:56.064
Look!

00:33:58.183 --> 00:33:58.864
Figured it out.

00:34:04.223 --> 00:34:04.784
Go ahead.

00:34:06.824 --> 00:34:08.184
We need more investment.

00:34:15.423 --> 00:34:16.344
Excuse me?

00:34:17.463 --> 00:34:19.103
We need more funds.

00:34:27.423 --> 00:34:28.423
Are you insane?

00:34:28.744 --> 00:34:31.184
You still owe me money,

00:34:31.664 --> 00:34:32.824
now you want more from me?

00:34:33.143 --> 00:34:34.463
Have you lost your mind?

00:34:35.304 --> 00:34:36.423
You want me

00:34:36.583 --> 00:34:37.904
to fall in the same trap twice?

00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:39.943
Are you taking me for a fool?

00:34:40.063 --> 00:34:41.344
Are you fooling me around?

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:46.904
Lovely night tonight.

00:34:47.344 --> 00:34:48.143
Let's take a walk.

00:34:54.664 --> 00:34:55.304
Walk?

00:34:58.143 --> 00:34:58.623
Fine.

00:35:01.503 --> 00:35:03.543
Should we hold hands?

00:35:04.224 --> 00:35:07.103
Why don't you suggest to date?

00:35:14.264 --> 00:35:15.503
What I offer

00:35:16.904 --> 00:35:18.184
will not disappoint you.

00:35:20.503 --> 00:35:21.143
Well,

00:35:21.864 --> 00:35:23.103
people from big cities

00:35:23.184 --> 00:35:23.824
are so special.

00:35:27.103 --> 00:35:27.543
Alright.

00:35:28.304 --> 00:35:28.864
Where to?

00:35:38.704 --> 00:35:39.423
Shen Haoming.

00:35:41.224 --> 00:35:41.983
What are you doing?

00:35:43.063 --> 00:35:44.463
We're almost at my place.

00:35:50.704 --> 00:35:52.744
You said to walk with you,

00:35:53.344 --> 00:35:54.864
and I've walked with you this long.

00:35:55.543 --> 00:35:56.704
Say something.

00:35:59.304 --> 00:36:00.503
Say something!

00:36:00.664 --> 00:36:01.224
Almost there.

00:36:02.143 --> 00:36:02.664
Almost there?

00:36:03.824 --> 00:36:04.744
Let me tell you.

00:36:05.224 --> 00:36:06.143
This is my place.

00:36:06.304 --> 00:36:07.623
If you try any tricks,

00:36:07.744 --> 00:36:08.824
I'll beat you up!

00:36:10.103 --> 00:36:10.864
Ms. Wang.

00:36:14.344 --> 00:36:15.423
Haoming.

00:36:15.583 --> 00:36:16.423
What brings you here?

00:36:16.423 --> 00:36:16.943
I...

00:36:17.904 --> 00:36:18.503
Haoming.

00:36:18.864 --> 00:36:20.344
Why didn't you tell me you'd come?

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:21.143
To surprise you.

00:36:21.344 --> 00:36:22.264
Whose car is this?

00:36:23.103 --> 00:36:23.503
Go.

00:36:24.423 --> 00:36:25.344
Go!

00:36:25.423 --> 00:36:25.943
Go.

00:36:26.143 --> 00:36:26.943
- Go.
- Go.

00:36:27.143 --> 00:36:28.023
Go.

00:36:28.103 --> 00:36:28.664
- Go.
- Go.

00:36:29.023 --> 00:36:30.583
One, two, one.

00:36:33.864 --> 00:36:34.264
Mom.

00:36:35.623 --> 00:36:36.423
Why are you here?

00:36:36.704 --> 00:36:37.344
I...

00:36:39.943 --> 00:36:40.583
Haoming.

00:36:41.063 --> 00:36:42.583
Did he cause trouble again?

00:36:43.103 --> 00:36:43.704
Tell me,

00:36:43.983 --> 00:36:44.983
I'll beat him hard!

00:36:45.503 --> 00:36:45.824
Hey.

00:36:45.983 --> 00:36:46.943
Ms. Wang.

00:36:47.264 --> 00:36:48.063
He didn't.

00:36:48.304 --> 00:36:50.583
We're discussing business nearby,

00:36:50.784 --> 00:36:51.543
so I came to you.

00:36:51.904 --> 00:36:52.943
Discussing business?

00:36:53.784 --> 00:36:54.904
Legitimate business?

00:36:55.543 --> 00:36:56.623
Of course, it's legitimate.

00:36:57.264 --> 00:36:59.623
Defu is partnering with Jinda Group.

00:37:02.023 --> 00:37:02.623
Really?

00:37:03.543 --> 00:37:04.943
Wonderful!

00:37:05.184 --> 00:37:06.304
Please come in.

00:37:06.344 --> 00:37:06.904
Please.

00:37:07.184 --> 00:37:08.143
Alright.

00:37:10.023 --> 00:37:10.864
Mind your words.

00:37:12.423 --> 00:37:14.184
Come in, Haoming.

00:37:14.304 --> 00:37:14.983
Come on in.

00:37:15.143 --> 00:37:15.623
No need.

00:37:15.864 --> 00:37:17.423
We can talk here.

00:37:18.704 --> 00:37:19.664
Alright, have a seat.

00:37:19.664 --> 00:37:20.103
Alright.

00:37:20.103 --> 00:37:21.103
I'll make some tea.

00:37:21.103 --> 00:37:21.463
No need.

00:37:21.543 --> 00:37:22.543
I'll leave soon.

00:37:22.744 --> 00:37:23.304
Don't bother.

00:37:23.744 --> 00:37:24.864
Alright, sit then.

00:37:26.103 --> 00:37:26.704
You!

00:37:27.384 --> 00:37:28.023
Talk properly.

00:37:34.344 --> 00:37:35.023
Shen Haoming.

00:37:36.543 --> 00:37:37.623
How do you know my mom?

00:37:38.824 --> 00:37:40.463
Don't be nervous.

00:37:41.304 --> 00:37:44.264
I met your mom days ago

00:37:44.864 --> 00:37:45.943
at the senior care event.

00:37:48.344 --> 00:37:50.103
You disappeared for days,

00:37:50.463 --> 00:37:51.463
so you found my mom.

00:37:53.463 --> 00:37:54.423
Listen.

00:37:55.344 --> 00:37:57.304
If you threaten me using my mom,

00:37:57.543 --> 00:37:58.784
you're asking for death.

00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:01.184
Mr. Wang,

00:38:02.583 --> 00:38:04.583
these years you've traded stocks,

00:38:05.184 --> 00:38:06.463
and run private loans,

00:38:07.983 --> 00:38:11.264
earning good money smoothly.

00:38:11.864 --> 00:38:13.864
And you got many lackeys under you.

00:38:15.623 --> 00:38:17.023
But you people

00:38:17.704 --> 00:38:20.344
are always domineering.

00:38:21.143 --> 00:38:22.744
In the neighbors' eyes,

00:38:23.583 --> 00:38:24.943
you're definitely no good people.

00:38:25.423 --> 00:38:26.824
None of your business.

00:38:28.704 --> 00:38:29.943
Despite your bad reputation,

00:38:30.543 --> 00:38:31.704
you're filial.

00:38:34.304 --> 00:38:36.184
Every year on your mom's birthday,

00:38:36.224 --> 00:38:37.784
you'd kneel to wash her feet,

00:38:38.543 --> 00:38:39.664
yet she rejects it.

00:38:40.304 --> 00:38:42.864
She would kick over the basin.

00:38:44.583 --> 00:38:47.704
Our residential project
is near the bus terminal.

00:38:49.184 --> 00:38:52.304
But the access road is still unpaved,

00:38:52.784 --> 00:38:53.864
highly inconvenient.

00:38:55.063 --> 00:38:57.224
If we can repair this road,

00:38:58.184 --> 00:39:00.664
the residents will benefit.

00:39:01.103 --> 00:39:02.864
All villagers along the road

00:39:02.864 --> 00:39:04.864
will have improved livelihoods.

00:39:05.304 --> 00:39:07.744
The town government
supports this too, right?

00:39:09.023 --> 00:39:10.184
What do you mean?

00:39:11.423 --> 00:39:14.143
Your previous investments
became bad debts.

00:39:15.503 --> 00:39:16.583
They are unrecoverable.

00:39:16.904 --> 00:39:19.264
If you invest more money

00:39:19.583 --> 00:39:20.623
for the road construction,

00:39:21.423 --> 00:39:23.583
the group will reevaluate

00:39:24.824 --> 00:39:25.744
and set up new budgets.

00:39:26.503 --> 00:39:30.304
Your lost money would
become legitimate investments.

00:39:30.904 --> 00:39:33.224
Then you can retrieve your funds.

00:39:33.423 --> 00:39:33.864
Understand?

00:39:34.744 --> 00:39:36.063
Are you fooling me around?

00:39:38.704 --> 00:39:40.224
Let's sign an agreement then.

00:39:41.543 --> 00:39:43.224
When the apartments have been completed,

00:39:44.264 --> 00:39:45.423
you can choose one first.

00:39:48.264 --> 00:39:52.184
You run a landscaping company, right?

00:39:54.304 --> 00:39:55.344
You can get

00:39:55.583 --> 00:39:58.344
all the landscaping of our project.

00:40:00.023 --> 00:40:00.864
Seriously?

00:40:01.224 --> 00:40:01.983
You know

00:40:03.143 --> 00:40:04.384
who I am, right?

00:40:05.304 --> 00:40:07.423
I keep my promise.

00:40:07.824 --> 00:40:08.744
As a native here,

00:40:09.023 --> 00:40:10.423
if you invest in road construction,

00:40:10.824 --> 00:40:12.503
it would truly

00:40:14.423 --> 00:40:17.103
benefit villagers
and bring honor to your family.

00:40:17.824 --> 00:40:19.583
Everyone will remember your name.

00:40:20.143 --> 00:40:21.864
Wang Defu.

00:40:23.184 --> 00:40:24.304
And I believe your mom

00:40:25.344 --> 00:40:27.824
will be very proud of you.

00:40:29.983 --> 00:40:33.744
I've sent all road reconstruction
contracts to your company.

00:40:34.543 --> 00:40:36.744
They include
official town government approvals.

00:40:38.023 --> 00:40:39.224
Think it over.

00:40:39.824 --> 00:40:41.983
And we'll discuss after that.

00:40:43.664 --> 00:40:44.423
It's getting late.

00:40:44.744 --> 00:40:45.543
I'm leaving.

00:40:49.943 --> 00:40:50.983
Pleasure to meet you.

00:40:55.704 --> 00:40:56.983
What did I say?

00:41:03.063 --> 00:41:04.543
Lovely night tonight.

00:41:06.983 --> 00:41:07.864
Indeed.

00:41:08.744 --> 00:41:09.943
We even held hands.

00:41:12.543 --> 00:41:13.063
You're here.

00:41:16.184 --> 00:41:16.904
Mr. Shen.

00:41:17.824 --> 00:41:18.704
What a feast!

00:41:19.423 --> 00:41:20.423
You've been here so long,

00:41:20.423 --> 00:41:21.744
yet I never hosted you properly.

00:41:21.824 --> 00:41:22.943
Now you're treating me.

00:41:22.983 --> 00:41:23.784
This makes me...

00:41:23.784 --> 00:41:24.304
Have a seat.

00:41:24.423 --> 00:41:25.423
I'm so embarrassed.

00:41:26.824 --> 00:41:27.824
I brought fine wine.

00:41:29.184 --> 00:41:30.784
We can have a drink later.

00:41:34.824 --> 00:41:36.184
Mr. Shen.

00:41:36.983 --> 00:41:39.103
After working together all this time,

00:41:39.264 --> 00:41:43.784
I see you have genuine
construction expertise.

00:41:44.224 --> 00:41:45.744
You even

00:41:45.904 --> 00:41:47.704
tamed that Wang Defu.

00:41:48.583 --> 00:41:49.623
You're young and capable.

00:41:50.463 --> 00:41:51.143
Impressive!

00:41:51.503 --> 00:41:51.943
Here.

00:41:52.664 --> 00:41:54.423
Let's have a drink.

00:41:55.503 --> 00:41:56.184
Let me toast you.

00:41:56.664 --> 00:41:57.344
Thank you.

00:42:01.864 --> 00:42:02.583
Let's eat.

00:42:09.304 --> 00:42:11.304
The group approved the budget?

00:42:12.344 --> 00:42:12.983
Yes.

00:42:13.784 --> 00:42:14.583
Really?

00:42:14.943 --> 00:42:15.864
Fantastic!

00:42:16.103 --> 00:42:16.824
Let me tell you,

00:42:16.864 --> 00:42:18.143
I've been waiting

00:42:18.184 --> 00:42:20.423
for this project to get back on track.

00:42:20.623 --> 00:42:20.983
Here.

00:42:21.304 --> 00:42:22.583
Let's celebrate. Come on.

00:42:24.503 --> 00:42:25.583
A new general manager will

00:42:26.063 --> 00:42:26.784
come tomorrow.

00:42:27.784 --> 00:42:28.423
What?

00:42:40.184 --> 00:42:43.503
This is a farewell banquet?

00:42:50.103 --> 00:42:50.983
Fire me?

00:42:56.543 --> 00:42:57.423
I can leave.

00:42:57.664 --> 00:42:58.864
I won't stay a minute longer.

00:42:59.344 --> 00:43:00.704
But remember,

00:43:01.143 --> 00:43:01.983
with me here,

00:43:02.664 --> 00:43:04.423
this mess remains contained.

00:43:04.704 --> 00:43:08.103
If I leave,
this will collapse instantly.

00:43:09.063 --> 00:43:10.184
You can't leave now.

00:43:10.904 --> 00:43:12.423
Wait until I audit the deficits,

00:43:12.816 --> 00:43:13.746
and then you can leave.

00:43:14.503 --> 00:43:15.143
What?

00:43:16.023 --> 00:43:16.824
Audit on me?

00:43:17.583 --> 00:43:18.063
Go!

00:43:18.224 --> 00:43:19.423
Let's go to the office now!

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.983
I will hand over every password,

00:43:21.023 --> 00:43:21.943
every account!

00:43:22.543 --> 00:43:23.304
Let me tell you.

00:43:23.384 --> 00:43:25.023
I am completely clean.

00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:26.184
All these years,

00:43:26.543 --> 00:43:28.664
I never took an extra cent
from the company!

00:43:29.904 --> 00:43:30.904
Shen Haoming.

00:43:31.744 --> 00:43:32.664
You are outrageous.

00:43:38.583 --> 00:43:42.224
Does your brother-in-law
run a jade shop in town,

00:43:42.824 --> 00:43:43.744
selling antiques?

00:43:43.983 --> 00:43:44.503
Yes.

00:43:45.184 --> 00:43:46.904
A legitimate business
with proper licenses.

00:43:47.023 --> 00:43:47.583
What's wrong?

00:43:48.623 --> 00:43:49.143
Moreover,

00:43:49.184 --> 00:43:50.423
my brother-in-law

00:43:50.463 --> 00:43:51.503
has nothing to do with me.

00:43:52.623 --> 00:43:53.623
Including stone gambles?

00:43:55.463 --> 00:43:56.423
A stone

00:43:56.543 --> 00:43:57.704
costs tens of thousands,

00:43:58.464 --> 00:43:59.664
or even hundreds of thousands.

00:43:59.784 --> 00:44:00.344
Man!

00:44:00.463 --> 00:44:01.824
That's the gamble!

00:44:02.023 --> 00:44:02.664
Take all

00:44:02.704 --> 00:44:03.664
or lose all.

00:44:03.744 --> 00:44:04.423
What's wrong?

00:44:13.304 --> 00:44:14.983
Are they really involving
gamble on stones

00:44:16.023 --> 00:44:18.744
or transferring the kickback to you?

00:44:33.744 --> 00:44:37.824
You contracted the project
to suspicious Anqiang.

00:44:39.423 --> 00:44:42.128
Mr. Wu transferred huge kickbacks

00:44:42.416 --> 00:44:45.423
through stone gambling.

00:44:48.143 --> 00:44:50.904
You committed seriously derelict

00:44:51.784 --> 00:44:55.423
and embezzled company assets.

00:44:55.704 --> 00:44:59.023
For major embezzlement, you'll get 3

00:44:59.784 --> 00:45:01.904
to 10 years imprisonment.

00:45:03.943 --> 00:45:08.224
Massive amounts,
you'll get over 10 years imprisonment

00:45:08.943 --> 00:45:10.063
or life sentence.

00:45:11.704 --> 00:45:12.983
You know it, right?

00:45:16.784 --> 00:45:18.344
Stop racking your brains.

00:45:19.864 --> 00:45:21.184
One last chance for you.

00:45:22.623 --> 00:45:23.543
Tell me,

00:45:24.023 --> 00:45:27.704
who's protecting you in Jinda Group?

00:45:30.224 --> 00:45:33.264
You handled
the Hongyun project delay well.

00:45:34.744 --> 00:45:35.423
Chairman,

00:45:35.664 --> 00:45:38.943
all connections between
our staff and Mr. Zhang

00:45:40.023 --> 00:45:41.224
are listed here.

00:45:41.664 --> 00:45:43.583
Should I handle the follow-up?

00:45:44.063 --> 00:45:45.184
No, I'll handle it.

00:45:45.664 --> 00:45:48.720
Your divorce cooling-off period
with Xu Yan should end soon, right?

00:45:48.943 --> 00:45:50.423
When will you finalize it?

00:45:51.784 --> 00:45:52.664
8th next month.

00:45:53.224 --> 00:45:54.143
Keep it low-key.

00:45:54.824 --> 00:45:55.463
Stay discreet.

00:45:56.543 --> 00:45:57.063
Got it.

00:45:57.784 --> 00:45:58.344
I'm leaving.

00:46:04.847 --> 00:46:05.447
(People to be accused
of the project delay)

00:46:05.918 --> 00:46:07.380
(Project Manager, Zhang Youcai)

00:46:10.066 --> 00:46:12.528
(Financial staff, Wang Zhiwen, Persons
linked to Zhang Youcai, Qu Mingcheng)

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.304
Qu hasn't arrived yet?

00:46:16.904 --> 00:46:17.423

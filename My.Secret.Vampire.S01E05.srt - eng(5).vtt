00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.300
You're not a kid.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.700
What kind of nightmare do you have
that you can't sleep alone?

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.480
That's my side.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.390
This used to be my room.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.200
Hyung, are you asleep?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.030
Mm.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.390
How can a sleeping person talk?

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.250
I can.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.229
Did you know?

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.620
Actually, I can't fall asleep
on the floor.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.050
Aren't you from the countryside?

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.000
People in the countryside
also sleep on beds.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.710
My parents doted on me.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.440
So?

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.090
Nothing. I just wanted to share...

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.880
Did your godfather

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.350
put on these star stickers for you?

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.730
Mmhmm.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.240
So you fell asleep watching that every day?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.180
I had insomnia.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.800
I don't know since when,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.000
but I've been suffering from insomnia.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.880
I found it scary to think how

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.270
only I was awake in this dark world.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.470
I remember that I cried a lot.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.730
So he pasted those on for me.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.810
I would count the stars all night...

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.820
until I finally fell asleep at dawn.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.580
What are you doing?

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.360
You'll fall asleep easily like that.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.880
Are you doing this 'cause
you don't want to sleep on the floor?

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.600
Hyung.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.940
Let's go see... real stars next time.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.399
Dongha? Are you asleep?

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.990
Dongha?

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.740
He's asleep.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.900
Hey, wait.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.700
What?

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.490
What if we bite him

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.830
and his blood doesn't taste good?

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.040
Why are you suddenly saying that?

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.430
That could happen.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.010
If that's the case,
we'd be doing this for nothing.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.390
It has to be better than expired plasma.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.840
I'm opening the door.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.740
Hey, wait!

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.260
What now?

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.550
You wouldn't really get addicted
to Dongha's blood, right?

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.620
Seriously?

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.200
Hyung,
why are you coming out of this room?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.060
What are you doing here?

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.970
Hey, run!

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.960
Seriously...

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.720
What's he going to do
starting tomorrow?

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.940
That's right.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.000
I'm not interfering with his private life.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.750
It's more like protecting him.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.010
If Sister finds out

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.270
that they bit Dongha,

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.530
who will have to clean up the mess?

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.560
It'd be me.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.770
So why am I here?

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.659
Vampires?

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.420
Tsk. There are no vampires in this world!

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.220
[Vampire Raspberry Cake]

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.070
Do you want to eat it?

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.310
There really are.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.320
I would like this.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.470
Mr. Vampire here said
he'd buy it for me.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.340
You mean the vampire raspberry cake?

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.780
Who is he?

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.150
I'm Kim Woojoo from 2nd grade, class 1,

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.100
the elite class,
of Songha Elementary School.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.500
Do you know this mister?

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.480
Is it okay to eat something
bought by a stranger?

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.200
I know him.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.400
He's a vampire.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.060
I want an Americano.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.730
How can a sleepless person drink coffee?

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.320
Have some tea.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.060
When do you get off work?

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.420
Are you going to wait for me?

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.810
Well...

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.030
I have to wait until
Woojoo's family comes to pick him up.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.840
I'll be off work soon.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.940
Tell this mister whatever you want to eat,

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.720
and he will buy them for you.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.940
But Mr. Vampire,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.750
I'd like to ask...

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.200
Are you interested in him?

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.770
Me?

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.980
Why do you ask?

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.560
People are bad at hiding two things:
love and sneezes.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.940
It's obvious.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.270
Kids learn things like this
in the elite class nowadays too?

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:39.260
I think

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.580
he's also interested in you.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.980
You have a chance.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.110
Hold it like this.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:13.840
Like this?

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.600
You can do it. Go for it.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.650
Try again.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.260
I'll carry you.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.070
It's in!

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.280
Shall we leave?

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.470
Sure.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.780
Thank you.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.760
Do you want to play a game with us?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.680
No, we're leaving.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.660
Here!

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.540
Pass!

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.200
Can we go home now?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.390
No.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.430
Why?

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.140
I thought about it.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.100
I'm thinking my insomnia might be caused by

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.160
not moving around enough.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.860
So I'm thinking about
going for a walk tonight.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.050
Sure, then. I'll be on my way first.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.230
Is there anything you want to do in Seoul?

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.990
I mean...

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.120
You're always either home or at work.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.520
Oh?
Are you interfering with my private life?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.740
Actually,
there's something I do want to do.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.850
Hey, wasn't it fun?

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.480
Why didn't you play with us earlier?

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.280
Let's play together next time.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.490
No.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.460
Just 'cause they're humans?

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.190
They're good. I almost lost.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.930
I just don't want to play.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.670
Why?

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.580
Don't you like playing basketball?

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.750
Let's play together.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.970
Let's beat them together next time.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.050
I don't like it!

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.250
What?

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.400
Who said I like playing basketball?

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.360
We've been playing it pretty often lately

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.000
so I thought
you liked playing basketball...

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.070
I'm playing it 'cause of you.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:49.120
Huh?

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.240
I'm playing it 'cause I like you.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.500
Actually, I hate playing basketball...

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.200
You're so clueless.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.490
This would suit Joowon.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.930
Han Dongha.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.310
Come here.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.760
Yes, what is it?

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.930
Well...

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.430
That's a nice styling.
Can I take a picture?

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.910
Oh? Sure.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.510
Let's take one over there.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.080
Here we go.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.310
One, two.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.060
Do you want to take one together with him?

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:06.640
N-Noâ€”

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.830
Sure!

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.770
Here we go. One, two.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.530
Is this what you wanted to do?

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.170
I guess you really
didn't want to take the photo.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.290
There are lasers coming out of your eyes.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.190
That camera is weird.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.830
I've got to keep it.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.500
Is there anything else you want to do?

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.750
There are many things.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.250
I want to go skating.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.850
Oh! I want to go see the sea too.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.230
The sea?

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.210
I've never been to the sea before.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.900
The last bus is about to arrive!

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.020
We missed it.

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.400
What should we do?

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.430
There might be cabs.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.020
One, two.

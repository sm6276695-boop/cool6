00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.550
Hyung, are you asleep?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140
You said you had insomnia...

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.740
[Lee Okhee]

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.530
Hello? Lee Joowon.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.979
Gosh.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.020
Why are you so hard to contact?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.450
H-Hello?

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.860
Have you been taking your pills on time?

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.990
Don't forget to take that blood plasma.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.700
What are you doing?

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.640
Your phone kept ringing loudly.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.610
I thought you were asleep,
so I was going to turn it off.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.070
I told you not to touch my stuff.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.570
Do you always do whatever you want?

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.079
I...

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.120
Hey, Han Dongha.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.920
Don't cross the line.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.360
You were the one
who crossed the line first.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.390
Why did you come look for me today?

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.660
I told you I couldn't sleep.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.829
Is that all?

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.640
Is there no other reason?

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.870
You...

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.140
have way too many secrets.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.660
Privacy?

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.500
Is your privacy that great?

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.150
Or do you just not trust me?

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.920
That's not what I meant.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.470
I thought we'd gotten a lot closer.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.370
But I don't know now.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.650
Gosh, you startled me.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.890
How did you know I was here?

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.160
Everyone knows your routine.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.760
What happened this time?

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.730
Just say something.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.399
It's weird that you're being so quiet.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.950
Right?

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.740
That's how you are like now.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.000
It's very strange.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.140
I'm in a bad mood.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.120
I tried staying up all night reading,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.940
or working out until I'm exhausted,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.710
but it hasn't gotten better.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.720
Why are you in a bad mood?

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.740
I don't know.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.230
If I knew, I wouldn't be so depressed.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.140
Is it not because of Dongha?

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.409
I saw you two fighting yesterday.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.450
We didn't fight.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.990
Right.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.240
You have to have feelings to fight.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.920
You can't have feelings for humans, right?

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.160
Lee Joowon.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.510
Let's go on a trip.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.660
What?

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.970
You said you did everything you liked.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.710
Then go on a trip, something you dislike.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.110
No.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.450
I'm in a bad mood too. Let's go.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.090
So we could readjust ourselves.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.800
I said no.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.330
Are you not going
even if I beg you like this?

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.670
Gosh, what a terrible bro.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.850
Instead...

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.800
Let's go see the sea.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.760
You applied sunscreen, right?

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.130
A whole bottle.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.350
Why are there five people suddenly?

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.570
What else? Just the two of us?

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.340
Why? What's wrong with that?

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.910
Give me your bag.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.390
Thank you.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.230
Why are we going to the sea
in winter?

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.060
It's a good thing.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.310
I have to share a room
with Han Dongha today.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.659
Did you book a room?

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.520
Of course.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.050
Finally...

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.050
Finally, the day is here...

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.830
Gyumin.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.280
I'm sorry about that day.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.760
Hey, why are you suddenly apologizing?

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.500
Get in quickly.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.920
What...

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.240
do you like to do?

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.990
Well.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.530
I want to do
something you like together too.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.840
Let's look for it together in the future.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.240
Are you in a better mood?

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.280
Well, kind of.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.600
I went too far yesterday.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.810
I'm sorry.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.030
This is the first time.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.520
What?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.750
I'm seeing the sea.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.020
Isn't it funny?

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.520
It's my first time too.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.340
Really? No way.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.740
Why?

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.480
I feel like,

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.190
unlike me, you've done everything.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.520
Let's do everything
one by one in the future.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.080
What? There's only one room?

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.350
That's weird. I booked three rooms.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.590
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.260
Why are you doing this? Huh?

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.840
No, that's not true.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.170
It's the most fun when everyone
sleeps together on a trip.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.050
Gosh.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.160
I guess we won't
be able to eat barbecue today.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.230
Why don't we skip dinner tonight?

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.270
We could clear our intestines too.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.030
But I want to eat meat.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.150
My suggestion is not great, yeah?

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.680
Why is it not working? Is it broken?

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.530
Dongha, that's amazing.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.840
I'm fine.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.260
Just keep it on.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.800
It's already almost a month.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.370
Right.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.700
I didn't know
it would become like this when I moved in.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.000
"Like this"?

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.560
It's nice to have met you guys.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.800
I won't forget you guys.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.680
Also...

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.750
I like Joowon.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.750
I'm declaring war against you.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.510
But you're so cool.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.980
I don't know if I can be your opponent.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.170
Why are you telling me this?

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.920
I just thought... I should tell you.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.640
Where are you going?

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.450
I didn't see Han Dongha.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.950
He'll be back soon.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.450
He's not a kid.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.830
It's dark. What if something happens?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.390
Go to sleep.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.710
Don't go.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.960
What's wrong?

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.300
I told you.
We can't be together with humans.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.900
Let me ask you one thing.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.270
Are you worried as a friend or...

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.180
I like you too.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.880
As a friend.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.130
That's all.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.400
You know that too.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.790
I feel the wall
Joowon built up between us.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.730
I want to know what's
on the other side of this wall.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.830
You might not be able to take it.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.450
Why are you out?

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.290
Do you want some sweet potatoes?

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.960
You can still eat?

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.890
There are marshmallows too.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.560
Hyung.
There's something I'm curious about.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.560
Please tell me honestly.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.480
What?

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.520
Hyung...

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.920
You came to see the sea
because of me, right?

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.510
You're being too self-conscious.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.470
I think you need to be honest.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.580
I'm always honest.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.330
Though I always feel like
I'm the one losing,

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.370
it's okay.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.500
Because I'm bad at hiding my emotions.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.830
Why are you smiling?

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.590
You told me to be honest.

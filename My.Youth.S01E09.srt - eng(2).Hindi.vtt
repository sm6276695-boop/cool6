00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.370
(Song Joong Ki)

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.070
(Chun Woo Hee)

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.510
(Lee Joo Myung)

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.510
(Seo Ji Hun)

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.890
(My Youth)

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.160
(Episode 9)

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.820
The person you have called...

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.190
Hey, Taxi!

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.980
Sir, you dropped your phone.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.350
Thank you.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.350
(Missed Call, Sung Je Yeon)

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.329
Excuse me...

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.299
I was told Sung Je Yeon was here.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.869
Okay, let me check. Please wait over there.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.870
Okay.

00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:12.739
Are you Sung Je Yeon's guardian?

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.739
- We spoke on the phone, right? - Oh, yes, that's right.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.139
How is Je Yeon? Is she okay?

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.239
She has acute appendicitis and needs to go into surgery.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.409
This way, please.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.510
Okay.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.809
What a relief.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.410
Oh, what a relief.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.750
Go away. I can't stand the sight of you.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.090
Are you okay?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.019
Should I get the doctor?

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.030
No, it's fine. I just had a painkiller.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.970
Why are you crying?

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.240
I'm sorry, Je Yeon.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.080
It's all my fault.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.450
I was so worried something had happened to you.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.650
I was losing my mind.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.590
I'm sorry.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.689
I'm sorry I got mad.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.200
You and your wild imagination. What were you picturing this time?

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.560
I...

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.570
I'm not who you think I am.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.110
I can't be that person.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.380
"But even so,"

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.310
"you're not going to bet on misfortune."

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.310
Not the you...

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.350
that I know.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.290
But I always bet on the worst outcome.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.420
Like an idiot.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.230
I'm the one who can't live without you.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.970
Then just be the person I know you are.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.140
Be the person that I know.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.140
Where have you gone?

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.850
Always leaving me...

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.850
behind.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.520
If you're not going to take me with you,

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.360
come back.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.890
- Come back, and... - I'll stay with you.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.780
I want to be with you.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.160
Promise.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.430
Sealed.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.670
Copied.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.779
I'll go get the doctor.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.820
No. Don't go.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.580
Don't go. Just stay here.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.650
Stay with me.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.459
Did the flower shop go out of business or something?

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.659
Don't you know anything?

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.400
Instead of worrying about that, redo this problem.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.439
I have my practical exam for the photography department soon.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.039
The bus ride is over two hours one way.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.079
I have to rent and carry the camera, lenses, and all this other gear.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.939
Just ask Hae to give you a ride.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.279
It's a secret from Hae until after I pass the exam.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.949
If the first and last digits are the same...

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.749
Besides, you're supposed to be my college prep tutor.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.989
I do everything you say, but my scores aren't improving.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.090
Why are you blaming me when you're the one who's slow?

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.029
- What? - You got your brains from your mom,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.660
so it must be real nice for you.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.369
How is she doing these days?

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.430
Is she well?

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.110
Why are you asking about Mom? You two don't share any memories.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.840
Hey, kid. You can't just touch anything here.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.349
It's a camera. For taking pictures.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.450
It's Chan's.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.620
You're pretty.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.550
This kid's got good taste.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.919
Want to try taking a picture?

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.590
Yes, please.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.630
All right.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.800
Just press this round button here.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.470
See anything?

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.559
The camera I use now? She's the one who gave it to me.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.959
That's why I like her.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.259
It's like we have a special memory, you know?

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.559
Gosh, that woman is something else.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.699
She wouldn't even acknowledge me for bringing you home.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.499
So you two were all chummy behind my back?

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.969
Must be nice. Why don't you ask her for a ride?

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.039
You're so petty.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.670
I just want to do well on my exam. All I'm asking for is a ride.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.010
Okay, fine.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.849
I'll take care of it. I'll give you a ride, so don't...

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.149
Don't worry.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.250
- You promise? - I said I would.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.159
(Sunwoo Hae)

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.190
Hey.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.390
When are you getting here? Hurry up.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.760
I can't make it home tonight.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.569
Yes, something just came up.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.300
Could you let Nu Ri know?

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.739
And make sure she eats, too.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.410
For a couple of days.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:56.869
Okay, I have to go.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.109
Seriously...

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.009
He's telling you to feed a grown-up. How embarrassing.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.409
I'm almost twenty myself.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.779
Tell me about it.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.279
Especially coming from him. He's always been responsible.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.119
But he always treats us like we're helpless kids, right?

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.320
And now he's staying out all night?

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.940
You've had a rough time.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.840
Yes.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.280
Right.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.219
Shouldn't you call your office?

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.390
Oh, right. Work.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.590
You have to step down as a manager.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.390
I'm on leave anyway.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.229
You should head back so you're not late.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.659
And take the chair with you.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.729
I'm supposed to be on my best behavior.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.970
I can't just leave you here when you're sick.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.769
I'll be here to take care of you until you're discharged.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.280
Oh, I couldn't ask you to do that.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.649
So you're really not going?

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.250
Nope. I'm staying right here with you.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.820
And do what?

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.790
What would you like?

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.560
Stroke my hair like you did before.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.970
Get some more sleep.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.490
What?

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.690
Hey.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.160
What are you doing here so late at night?

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.600
Oh, I must have fallen asleep...

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.970
Perfect timing.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.310
Is there anything you want?

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.880
Or anything you need?

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.710
I feel I asked you to pull strings and came empty-handed.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.420
So I thought I'd get you something to sweeten the deal.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.289
You might as well just threaten me. Or give me an ultimatum.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.390
That's your specialty, isn't it?

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.659
Think of it as a recruitment offer and consider it.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.859
You can start at the bottom and learn the ropes.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.370
What do you even see in me?

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.899
What makes you trust me?

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.870
If I can't trust you, my whole life has been a failure.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.369
The success or failure of your own life?

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.279
I thought you weren't the type to stake that on your own kid.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.110
Oh, you caught me.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.880
Maybe I had one too many.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.459
I understand everything you're saying, sir.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.960
That's the kind of choice a CEO has to make.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.660
Is your generation always...

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.370
so eager to be "understanding?"

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.799
Why can't you just do what you're told?

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.969
So I can keep you by my side.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.909
You already have one of those. Someone who does exactly as told.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.379
Who? Chan?

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.050
Gosh! Hardly.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.579
So what if he does what he's told?

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.050
He has to want to be here.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.390
Did something happen?

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.559
I needed comfort.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.460
And you're not that kind of person for me.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.530
Am I really...

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.130
the problem?

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.299
I don't want anything.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.640
I need a favor.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.170
A student has a practical exam.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.840
It's a four-hour round trip by bus.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.710
If you do this for me, I'll consider it.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:56.979
I'm serious.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.479
- But... - I don't have a license.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.890
So please, give her a ride.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.659
Seriously? At your age...

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.729
- Ouch! - Then why'd you even buy a car?

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.729
I thought I'd get my license right away.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.059
Unbelievable.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.660
I know you're my son, but honestly...

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.030
Wait, what's all this about a student?

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.369
- He ran away from home? - Yes.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.540
Then as of right now, I'm running away too.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.449
I'm going to crash at Min Kyung's for now.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.489
I'll still go to school, but I'll ignore Sunwoo Hae's calls.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.520
Right. If your teacher calls him, he'll find out you ran away.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.419
Wait, isn't getting caught kind of the point?

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.030
I've never even imagined living with anyone but him.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.060
But he's even sleeping over?

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.500
Take your time.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.739
Sa Rang!

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.300
Hey! Hey, Choi Gi Ppeum!

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.939
The house is a pigsty now that you're gone.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.479
Then clean it up, you pig.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.209
Did you manage to sneak the suit out past Mom?

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.409
Yes.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.549
- Hello. - Hello.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.819
- Choi Gi Ppeum. - Yes?

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.020
Can I borrow some money?

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.749
Seriously...

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.890
I'm still crashing at my friend's place.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.160
I actually already took some out for you.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:14.690
Thanks.

00:14:14.691 --> 00:14:16.359
I'm actually here on an errand for the director.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.559
- I'm heading out. - Okay.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.260
- Enjoy your meal. - Thanks.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.769
Hello.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.240
- I'm here to pick up a takeout. - So why'd he get kicked out?

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040
Well...

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.509
He took a leave from the college he worked so hard for and came back.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.379
Said something about how studying "wasn't his path."

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.250
That sounds like my brother.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.110
- Oh, right. - Bye.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.259
Since I don't have a license,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.560
I got that lady you have all those memories with.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.230
Let her know the schedule.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.700
So you don't have a license.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.130
That lady is so cool.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.369
But it'll be kind of awkward if it's just me and her.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.740
Then just ask Seok Joo to go with you.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.110
Well, look at you, Choi Sa Rang. So smart.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.580
Are you sure you left the passport here?

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.480
It's not here.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.320
Gosh, where could it be then?

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.450
You think Je Yeon has it?

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.090
That must be it.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.990
She's probably holding onto it so you can't go anywhere.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.160
Excuse me? Is anyone here?

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.889
Well, look who it is.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.530
Hurry up and go to your workout.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.230
Hello.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.470
What on earth happened to Je Yeon?

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.110
My goodness, appendicitis?

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.940
Oh, where are my manners? Here's my card.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.509
I parked the car where you asked.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.779
So, are you moving the chairs now?

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.880
- Oh, yes. - Yes.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.649
I really enjoyed your show.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.090
I read the article, too.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.019
That the author of "World Made of Ash..."

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.429
is Bebop.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:56.590
Oh, right.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.930
I'm Bang Han Na.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.760
Oh, hello.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.540
Mr. Jin Mu Yeong?

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.300
Yes.

00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:09.309
I saw the "World Made of Ash" movies,

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.770
and I transcribed the whole book by hand.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.909
Its prose is dark and cynical, but...

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.680
the underlying message itself is actually so warm, and...

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:17.480
Well...

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.979
Did I do that?

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.689
In true fantasy, the world-building can't just be background setting.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.520
It has to comprehensively embody the author's intent...

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.790
Could I get a handshake?

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.060
Oh, sure.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.729
I'm glad you enjoyed it. Thank you.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:33.929
- Yes. - But who...

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.029
This is my colleague, Choi Gi Ppeum.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.839
- Oh, nice to meet you. - Yes.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.569
Now that the fan meet is over, should we go move those chairs?

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.639
Oh, right.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.310
How it explores worldly desires while keeping a moral line...

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.750
The intricate world-building...

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.250
That's enough, Gi Ppeum.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.449
Have you eaten?

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.919
We're about to eat. Would you like to join us?

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.119
Oh, no, thank you.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.460
I'll just help you with the chairs and be on my way.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:04.600
Excuse me, but...

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.930
are the rights to your other novels available?

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.199
This industry is all about the IP,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.839
and you've already had one book adapted.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.870
Plus, you clearly have a dedicated fanbase.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.109
So, regarding the rights,

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.779
I'd love to discuss it with you sometime.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.949
But I don't really know much about that business.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.050
I do.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.720
I'll visit your flower shop to buy a plant.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.720
Could I just have a cup of tea, please?

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.760
Of course.

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.170
I'm home.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.670
Oh, you're back?

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.469
Hey.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.740
How many times do I have to say perilla oil is better than sesame?

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.020
(Sesame oil)

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.300
Give it here.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.200
Hey!

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.669
Didn't I tell you specifically to use perilla oil for this?

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:23.309
Nu Ri likes sesame oil more.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.839
Oh, come on!

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.140
Did you two get in a fight?

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.380
She seemed really ticked off.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.550
No, her birth mother showed up.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.880
And I...

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.389
told her she should go live with her.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.660
What? Why are you just telling me this now?

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.729
You didn't even talk to me about it?

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.700
I wasn't thinking straight.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.129
I'm going to fix it.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.769
I thought I played a part in raising Nu Ri, too.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.099
Oh, please.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.439
With grades like hers? What part did you play in that?

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.539
What?

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.709
Look at me right now. I'm the one who took half a day off...

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.809
to come here and clean this mess. Who's doing that?

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:01.810
Me.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.449
I swear...

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.650
You always act like you're carrying the whole burden.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.150
Always looking for credit.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.659
You got paid for tutoring her every single time, right?

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.489
You said that was for my travel expenses.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.489
Look who's talking about taking credit.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.860
Just get the seasoning right.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.660
It's salty!

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.670
Gosh. The nerve.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.709
Nu Ri.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.520
So, I've been thinking.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.390
Why'd you run away from home?

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.390
To make a point, right?

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:44.860
Exactly.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.819
To show them just how hurt and angry I am.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.759
But your brother's busy right now.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.759
Wouldn't it be more effective when he has time?

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.960
So you'd have his full attention.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.329
So how about you go home for today,

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.599
and we'll make your point next time? After your exams.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.700
Okay?

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.439
Nu Ri, what do you say?

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.940
Well?

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.339
Oh, come on. What was that?

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.880
You're unbelievable.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.280
Thanks, Sa Rang.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.020
All right, let's get back to studying.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.690
I'll take you home after you finish your online lecture.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.189
Okay.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.260
I'm just going to run to the bathroom.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.100
This is your chance to get on her brother's good side.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.939
(Send to Start of Spring)

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.100
(Hello.)

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.410
(Last episode airs now!)

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.890
Is that your phone going off?

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.320
What?

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.789
Mine?

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.320
Sounds like it.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.330
I see.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.330
The flower shop's social media.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.740
We're closed, but alerts won't stop. I'll be quick.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.409
Hello. I'm Choi Sa Rang, Nu Ri's friend.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:10.909
We met the other day.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.609
Nu Ri's with me right now, so please don't worry.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.109
I'll make sure she gets home safely.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.949
I swear, these two...

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:17.950
What is it?

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.550
Oh, is that her tall friend?

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.690
Yes.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.389
He is really tall.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.490
Yes.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.560
Wait, how do you know him?

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.169
Well...

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.639
- In front of your house... - In front of our house?

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.570
No, I mean, not at the house. I just ran into him by chance.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.780
I see.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.649
You kept this from me?

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.680
No, I...

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.279
It's your sister's private life.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.479
Unbelievable.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.890
You're getting pretty bold, aren't you?

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.690
No, look, it's my sister's private life, so...

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.100
Aren't you hungry?

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.040
- Should I order some ramyeon? - Let's break up.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.470
What?

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.609
Did you forget I also help manage the flower shop's account?

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.939
I can't stand guys who go behind my back.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.979
No, that's not it. Nu Ri, I...

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.279
Nu Ri, I was wrong.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.479
I was just worried he'd be worried.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.650
Nu Ri, I'm sorry!

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.819
I can't believe I missed the premiere.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.160
And it's already the finale.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.660
Why aren't you watching the show when you're in it?

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.669
The show itself just wasn't that important to me.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.170
Aren't you curious how you came across?

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.939
How could you not watch it?

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.440
I told you.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.510
Just seeing you a few more times was enough for me.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.280
I thought I might get to see you a few more times.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.280
That was a big reason I agreed to do the show.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:04.550
Was that...

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.020
for real?

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.029
Seriously, what do you take me for?

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.199
People will say anything to win someone over.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.359
Hey, it's not like it worked on you.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.730
You turned me down flat, so what are you even talking about?

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.799
Let's just call a truce...

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.400
and focus on the show.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.990
Thank you.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:41.790
For what?

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.390
For showing that no matter what I was like before,

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.430
I'm now a decent person,

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:53.540
living life to the fullest,

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.980
and surrounded by good people.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.190
I wish there is a TV where your mom is.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.859
Yes, that would be nice.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.870
Yes.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.970
I saw there was a scene where you wrote a letter.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.200
Were you writing to your mom?

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.110
Hey, what? What is it?

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.219
You...

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.219
That was me writing a letter to myself.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.890
You weren't paying attention, were you?

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.959
I was too busy focusing on the present.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.390
Oh, were you now?

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:57.930
Sung Je Yeon.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.740
Hey.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.680
What?

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.060
Is a guy like me okay for you?

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.930
It's not that I don't have those pathetic thoughts, but...

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.210
being apart from you...

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:38.910
I don't think I can go through that again.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.750
I want to do everything with you.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.090
From now on,

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.890
no matter what happens,

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:58.530
how much it hurts,

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.430
or how upsetting things might get...

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.980
Still, let's do everything together.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:16.910
Okay.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.590
The man you know...

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.889
I'll become him.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:28.990
Good.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.240
Look forward to it.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.210
Don't be too surprised.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.610
Okay.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.449
Hey.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:23.650
Are you bored?

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.550
You're the one who wanted to do this.

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:27.750
Right.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.149
The bubbles are bigger,

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.460
and this whole setup is way better.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.029
No, that's not it.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.030
This is fun.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.870
Want to go again? Let's go again.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.369
Sure, one more time.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:45.370
Okay.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.040
Gosh!

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.750
It's been so long.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.759
I was at the studio today, working on some guitar riffs.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.820
For the new album.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.429
But the guys just won't listen.

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.360
Min Kyu, that must be so hard on you.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.830
No, it's okay. Seeing you makes it all better.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:19.969
Oh, right.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:21.770
You said you were looking for a tax accountant, right?

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:24.740
Our sound engineer's younger brother is a tax accountant.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.539
I could introduce you.

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.080
I already found one.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.110
I did, but...

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.090
Well, it's just that something happened.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:37.650
Or maybe not.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.820
Maybe nothing happened.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.029
What was that about?

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.430
Why are you getting all serious? You're ruining the fun.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.799
What's with you all of a sudden?

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.740
I thought we agreed to just be friends.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:55.970
No.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.040
Why can't we?

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.079
Should we head out?

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.080
I'm tired.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.350
So we're just blowing bubbles? No strings attached?

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.510
Good.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.480
Great.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.380
Good.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.980
Maybe adjust your glasses a little?

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.780
That's it. Good.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.790
Good, the look is perfect. Good.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:20.159
Yes, that's great.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.360
One, two.

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.760
Oh, that's great.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.500
Manager.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.499
- Are you heading back to work now? - Oh, hey, Seok Joo.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.970
I was supposed to be heading back, but I can't miss this. You?

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.509
I faked an off-site meeting to get out.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.509
The general manager looked like he was in a foul mood.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:40.710
I'm just going to go home, and...

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.820
Okay, good. Just tilt your head down a little.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.749
You said Mo Tae Rin is your client, right, Seok Joo?

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.560
What's she like in person? She seems so cute on her show.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.689
How can she enjoy it like that with everyone staring at her?

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:58.030
Man, I could never do that.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.160
Me neither.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.029
How can anyone stand all that attention?

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.339
- Let's take a quick break. - Great work.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.369
Tae Rin, this is great. You're looking so beautiful.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:08.470
You think so?

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.189
Kim Seok Joo?

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:29.429
Oh, my.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.629
She's looking this way.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.260
I think she recognizes you, Seok Joo.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.300
Yes, thank you.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.570
What?

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.310
Hello!

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.410
How have you been?

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:47.810
What's going on?

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.410
Why is he over there?

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.980
Hey!

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.749
That time...

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.919
Gi Ppeum, were you at the office then?

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.119
When he came by?

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.549
No, he's in my driving class.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.760
Gosh!

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.290
What? Why are you so happy to see me?

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:04.829
Hey.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:06.929
Please, just let me get a picture with Mo Tae Rin.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.499
Oh, ma'am, please...

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.429
- Oh, I can't. - Please, I'm begging you.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:11.699
My daughter's a huge fan.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.470
No, I... I can't.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:16.310
So it's a no, then.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.409
I guess I'm just a useless mom...

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.340
Oh, come on, don't say that.

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.619
I'll see what I can do.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.820
Really?

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:50.910
Oh, hello there.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.780
Oh, how have you been?

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.109
I was in the area for work and happened to see you.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.850
You know him too? I know him as well.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.979
How do you know him, Gi Ppeum?

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.919
He's in the same class as me.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.360
I haven't seen you around at all lately.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.490
Don't tell me you got your license.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.490
No.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.460
Tae Rin.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.800
- Hello. - Hello.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.300
Well, it's just...

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:25.239
Just one picture together...

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.410
With me? Why all of a sudden?

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:32.009
- Hello? - Our manager...

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.750
Oh, so you're a fan of Tae Rin's?

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.860
You're a fan?

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.920
Gosh.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:42.690
Why, though?

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:45.190
Why...

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.729
You should've said something sooner.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:49.929
You must've been too shy when you came to the office.

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.469
- I... - You two, get closer.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.369
Gi Ppeum, go get something for her to sign.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:54.740
- Get a few! - Oh, okay.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.540
No, not me. The person over there...

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.840
- I'll go right now. - Ma'am.

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:02.710
Ma'am, where are you going?

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.749
- Is this spot okay? - No...

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.920
Okay. One, two, three!

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.049
Okay, one more. Looks good.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:12.960
One, two, three!

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.649
Well, well. Staying out all night, were you?

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:38.650
What?

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.150
And you've been ignoring my calls.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.950
Did you snitch and tell him I was here?

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:48.320
I told him to come here. You like pizza, right?

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:50.829
And I knew you wouldn't answer my calls.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:51.929
Look, sir...

00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:54.299
It's not like Nu Ri just ran away to be mean or anything.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.729
Ran away?

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.629
You ruined everything!

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.099
We already broke up. So why did you suggest pizza?

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.299
Nu Ri.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.470
This "let's break up" habit of yours is getting really old.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.979
You've been like that since we were in tenth grade.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.640
Gosh, since tenth grade?

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.009
So what's next, your three-year anniversary?

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.780
Can I go get a Coke?

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.069
Get one for yourself, too.

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:35.440
You are the one buying me this.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:48.890
This is good.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.959
I've been looking at prep schools for photography.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.219
If you really cram starting now...

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.890
I'm going to take my practical exam for photography.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:59.959
A practical exam? When?

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.159
We were fighting, so I asked Seok Joo for a favor.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.829
And his mom said she'd give me a ride.

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.129
Kim Seok Joo doesn't have a license.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.969
I thought all adults had one.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:10.370
So if you're going to be mad, be mad at Kim Seok Joo.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.710
Okay.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:16.410
Okay, I will.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.579
You're not mad?

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.849
If you say it's okay, then I guess it's okay.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.450
Tell me the schedule, so I can send you with something.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.860
Okay.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:36.730
Nu Ri.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.730
But can you do one thing for me?

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.510
About when your mom came to see you...

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.010
I think you're making her wait for too long.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.680
The way I hurt you with my words...

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.019
I'll make it up to you.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.620
- So you have to... - Me too.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:01.859
Secretly contacting Chan's dad,

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.460
I was lying to you.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.959
I'll meet with my mom.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.300
I've been thinking about it anyway. It's not because I'm upset with you.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:14.670
Okay, I get it.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.609
All right, everyone, go get dinner. We'll meet back here at 7pm.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:21.040
- Okay. - Got it.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.779
Okay, we'll go grab a bite and be right back.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.319
Can I have one?

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.120
Sure, go ahead.

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.289
What name should I put on it?

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:40.600
"Kim Seok Joo, Tax Accountant?"

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.400
"Mr. Seok Joo?"

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.370
Or just "Seok Joo?"

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.169
Just "Seok Joo?"

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.970
"Seok Joo" it is. Okay.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.339
I can't believe it. I had no idea you were a fan.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.780
You accused me of ulterior motives. Unbelievable.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:58.479
- I'm not your fan. - No, I'm just saying...

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.679
What's with you?

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.320
Before, my co-workers were around, so I was a little flustered.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.319
So was I supposed to just say,

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.919
"Hey, we blew bubbles together?"

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.920
Of course not.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.890
That's my personal life. This is work.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:21.440
So that's a no.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.640
Why are you smiling?

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.910
Because you included me in your personal life?

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:34.120
Do you still dislike me?

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.050
Didn't you say you disliked me?

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:42.089
You're the one who made a scene about not having any interest in me.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:44.729
So why are you asking me?

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.400
Didn't you say you needed me for the bubbles you couldn't blow?

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.130
Oh, come on.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.970
I was just saying that.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.970
I can't believe you're still hung up on that.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.880
I don't dislike you.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.940
As for having feelings...

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.080
I thought you weren't making a move.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.450
I guess I have some now.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:12.550
So when should we do it again?

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.780
Blow bubbles.

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:20.390
As soon as possible.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.830
(Tae Rin, Director Bang Han Na)

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.200
(Gi Ppeum)

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.520
(Gi Ppeum, CEO Pil Du)

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.620
(Producer Jin So Ra)

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.720
Oh, hey.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.590
Oh, your wedding invitations are out?

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.829
How did we not know that?

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.600
- I never would've guessed. - Me neither.

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:04.429
- You really couldn't tell? - Here, have some of this.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.630
Thank you.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.099
What did you think of the finale?

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.369
The editing was insane, right? I was crying.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:11.540
From watching yourself?

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.939
If it wasn't for me, she wouldn't have seen the finale.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.049
Why?

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:17.850
Actually, I don't really care.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:21.020
This is...

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.990
- Gosh. - The wedding invitation.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:26.390
Congratulations.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:28.619
Congratulations.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.530
But still, to marry a writer you see every day?

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.960
I must have been out of my mind.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:37.729
We're just booking a restaurant and keeping it small.

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.639
- Just come and relax. - Okay.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.299
And as for you, Bebop, feel free to just...

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.940
make the bouquet and the boutonniere for us.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.240
All right. I have to pay you back somehow.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:54.079
Pay me back for what?

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.120
Well...

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:57.420
You're the one...

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:00.920
who kept bringing me on for jobs.

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:04.430
And that's how Je Yeon and I got back together.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:07.800
Oh, my gosh!

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.070
This is crazy, seriously.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.440
I see.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.700
So that's what happened!

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.009
Congratulations.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.240
On getting back together. Oh, my.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:25.350
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.050
Oh, hold on.

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.550
(Nu Ri)

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.689
- Hey, Nu Ri. - Oh, hey.

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:35.459
I rented the camera,

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.889
and my exam schedule is out. It's super early in the morning,

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:39.359
so I'll stay nearby the night before.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.460
Okay, got it.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.969
And you made sure to pack everything listed in the guidelines, right?

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:48.599
Stop nagging. I'm not a kid anymore.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.110
- I'm not nagging... - I'm hanging up.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.480
Nu Ri.

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.680
Nu Ri? Eun Nu Ri?

00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:58.879
Is someone in your family applying to college?

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.120
My sister wants to major in photography.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:02.790
I see.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.320
And...

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.819
according to her homeroom teacher,

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:08.820
apparently,

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:11.890
she's actually pretty talented.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.969
She was always good at drawing, even when she was little.

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:18.200
Gosh.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:22.809
Your sister's amazing. To know what she wants already.

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:23.810
Yes.

00:43:23.811 --> 00:43:27.139
At her age, all I cared about was getting into college.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.310
- Not me. - Drawing a line, are we?

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:32.479
No, but...

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.819
Are you saying getting into college isn't everything?

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.819
No, I'm saying that's how I felt.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.020
Je Yeon, you should be our host.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.960
Me?

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:47.530
But...

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.870
Aren't people from school coming, too?

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.400
Yes, they are.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:56.210
Well...

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:01.540
Then...

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:06.820
I just...

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.190
I have some things to clean up in the back.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.449
I'll let you guys talk.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:13.920
- Excuse me. - Okay.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.159
What's wrong? Did you lie to Bebop about your degree or something?

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.699
What? Of course not.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.230
Why are you so nervous?

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.839
No, it's just...

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.470
I was worried he'd ask why I dropped out of school.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:32.780
Was it that obvious?

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:35.379
I thought you were trying to get me to leave.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.650
Oh, come on!

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.620
You're going to host the wedding, right?

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:42.920
About that...

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:45.720
I'm going to have to think about it.

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:50.060
So, did you decide to do it? The host gig?

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.600
I mean, it's Jin So Ra's wedding.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.330
I want to. I really do, but...

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:00.700
It's just...

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.240
I need to think it over.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:06.940
That's it?

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.779
Just...

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.410
What's the point of bringing up the past?

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.379
Dropping out isn't something to be proud of.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.020
Why not? It's your story. It's interesting.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.760
It's the most interesting story in the world.

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.670
What?

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:39.410
Je Yeon.

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:44.480
The guys you used to date...

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.220
Even if you talk about your exes,

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.649
I'm fine.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:50.650
What?

00:45:50.651 --> 00:45:52.489
The only topic you'd be awkward about with me...

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:54.420
is your dating history, right?

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.829
Hey, it's okay. That's all in the past.

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:02.260
You're not still in touch with them, are you? Right?

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:06.269
Yes, it's all fine. It's in the past.

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:08.099
Just texting is fine. Just that.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.240
But don't meet up with him alone or anything.

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:14.039
But does that even make sense to you?

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.139
I mean,

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:18.179
it's over between you, so why stay in touch?

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.949
I mean, come on!

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.080
This is...

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.790
Stop, okay?

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:26.859
Where are you going? Don't go, okay?

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.760
Stay with me, please?

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.360
Let's just stay here.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.630
But why aren't you answering me?

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.100
- What? - You're not in touch, right?

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:39.369
It's really in the past, right?

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:42.600
Oh, come on! What do you take me for?

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.040
Beat, you idiot.

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.210
What do you mean?

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.010
Bebop, you're the bigger idiot.

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.549
Hey, isn't that a puppy? Let's go!

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:53.819
No, it's not!

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.420
Yes, it is. Come on.

00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:57.990
Come on, hurry!

00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:59.690
Why did you leave me behind?

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:02.420
Dad.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:05.660
Was I such a burden?

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.699
Then what am I to you?

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.230
What exactly am I to you?

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:13.800
Do you even love me at all?

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.220
Oh my, you startled me.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:31.590
I was wrong.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:33.290
What I said was harsh.

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:38.259
Is that all you think was harsh?

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.059
Running away from home was wrong, too.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.499
Not contacting once and making you come find me...

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.600
All of it was wrong.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:52.540
Gosh, this place hasn't changed a bit.

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.410
Mister?

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.450
Oh, hi, Nu Ri.

00:47:57.850 --> 00:47:59.550
What is happening?

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:02.950
Should I give you two some privacy?

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:06.260
No, let's just go. Don't worry about it.

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.519
Wait, where are you going?

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.130
I said I was wrong.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:11.959
Nu Ri has no idea.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.759
You're the one who has no idea.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.459
Did you even know she has her entrance exam?

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.200
She has her practical exam early tomorrow.

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:20.299
You packed your toiletries and everything, right?

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.400
- Yes. - Yes.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:23.739
- Let's go. - And you?

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.510
Nuri said it would be awkward if it was just her and you.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.480
You can't just say that!

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.619
Oh, here.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.749
He wanted me to give you this to say thanks.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:38.749
He said they're tea bags.

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.860
But he wasn't sure if you'd like them.

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:42.760
Oh, my.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.530
Tell him I said thank you.

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.739
I forgive you. You can thank your son for that.

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.269
Oh, have a safe trip.

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:57.970
Good luck, Eun Nu Ri!

00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:59.680
Aren't you going?

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:02.779
I have night blindness. You'll have to drive.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.610
And Seok Joo said he doesn't have a license.

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:06.150
I see.

00:49:06.151 --> 00:49:08.149
Right, I should get going.

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:09.850
Wait, if he goes...

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:12.420
Am I sharing a room with him?

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.690
- I don't want to. - You should've gotten your license.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.359
Deal with it.

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.829
Don't pick on my husband.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.160
"My husband?"

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.399
"My husband..."

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.629
- Hey! - Gosh!

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:25.630
Wait.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.700
Not in front of the kids.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.110
It's bad luck. Don't look.

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:34.810
Mo Tae Rin!

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.810
Hey, what gives?

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.579
I told you I'd come to your office. Why the surprise visit?

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.850
Well, you always gave me rides.

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.619
I really wanted to give you this, and I couldn't wait.

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.630
What is it?

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:54.560
Ta-da!

00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:59.969
I was too busy with work to visit you in the hospital.

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:01.339
A welcome-back present.

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.570
Oh, you...

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.409
You really...

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:05.410
Here you go.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.210
Thank you.

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:13.149
It's so pretty.

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:16.079
Make sure you show this off to Bebop when you see him.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.189
Flaunt it.

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:18.990
Okay, I'll flaunt it!

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:23.060
So...

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.029
I...

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:30.069
Have I mentioned we're dating?

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:31.470
You just did.

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:33.599
So you're really dating?

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.900
It's all thanks to me, right?

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:37.440
I'm the one who told you about booking that mover guy, remember?

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:40.779
To be honest, I really didn't want to tell you.

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:43.080
He had his reasons, though.

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:45.749
Don't be so hard on him.

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:48.449
If he makes you cry one more time,

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.449
tell him he'll have me to deal with.

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:51.450
Okay.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.889
Hey, get in.

00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:58.089
What's this?

00:50:58.090 --> 00:50:59.430
Did you come to pick me up?

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.800
What?

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.729
Hey, this is the same kind of car you had, right?

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:09.139
Yes, I was used to this model, so the director got me the same one.

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:12.310
Gosh, nice of her.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.780
Oh, here.

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:18.210
Actually, the director was asking about you.

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:19.710
Here.

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:22.280
I found this to give you.

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:27.659
I should probably flee the country.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.560
Gosh. So...

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:32.060
What did you need my help with today?

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:34.229
My interview prep.

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:37.030
The photoshoot went well, but I still have the interview.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.170
I want to do well.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.200
All right.

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:46.439
"Your recent appearance in that nostalgia show was pretty unusual."

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.009
"What are your thoughts on that?"

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:50.480
Gosh, that sounded really natural.

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:53.779
"If through my past..."

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.850
"people can recall fond memories, then that's good."

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:01.159
Will people think I'm fake, just trying to act good?

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.560
What's so bad about that?

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:06.160
I wish everyone would be a little more phony and hypocritical.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.830
To be honest, I don't really remember back then.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:14.099
I was just...

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.600
like an animal, I guess?

00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:18.140
Why I was like that...

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:21.580
That's why variety shows and interviews are so hard for me.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.179
Everything gets recorded.

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:24.980
It's a record of my own humiliation.

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:31.149
Back then, your brain wasn't fully developed yet.

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:33.050
Everything's embarrassing at that age.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:36.890
I guess it's fully developed by now.

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.570
No.

00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:48.370
No.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.470
I even know how to pretend to be cool now.

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:53.740
See? You've matured.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.179
All right, next question.

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.009
So, who's the latest deadbeat you're...

00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:59.210
"If..."

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:03.849
"If you hadn't become an actress, what would you be doing today?"

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:05.849
This one's really hard.

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:07.990
I've been stuck on this for days.

00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:10.630
What about you?

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:13.659
If you hadn't become a manager, what do you think you'd be doing?

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:14.860
I don't know.

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:19.329
Hey, come on. You were stuck on it for days.

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:22.099
How am I supposed to answer in a few seconds?

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.310
Well, people always used to say it.

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:27.239
They'd never met a manager from a top university.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.240
Gosh.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.850
People really love slapping labels on everything.

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.279
I mean, look at me. I'm still stuck with the "former child actor" label.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.390
Then should we just get rid of them?

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:41.389
You just be Mo Tae Rin.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:43.330
And I'll just be Sung Je Yeon.

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.929
I'm glad I'm doing this with you.

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:49.930
Thanks to you, I can talk about this.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:51.330
Sure.

00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:56.070
But at least with interviews, you have a list of questions.

00:53:57.410 --> 00:54:00.080
But when it comes to talking about myself...

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:04.710
When and how to say things...

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:06.880
I just have no idea.

00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:10.319
I think...

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.290
if you hadn't become a manager,

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:16.590
you would have just been the real Sung Je Yeon.

00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:20.960
Just Sung Je Yeon.

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:26.900
It's just, since we've been apart, I've really come to realize it.

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:31.109
You're always so considerate and perceptive,

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:32.970
and you work so hard to fix things.

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:35.280
You took such good care of me.

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:37.210
You're a great listener.

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:41.820
But I wish you were only like that when you're at work.

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:46.660
And I'm sure I didn't help matters.

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:56.129
Am I digging my own grave here?

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:57.330
Yes.

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.139
So it was you? You're the one who made me this way.

00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:01.639
That's right!

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.169
I'm the culprit. What about it?

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:04.370
Exactly!

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:05.939
All right, next.

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:06.940
Okay.

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.939
"What was your hardest moment in your career as an actress..."

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.550
"and how did you overcome it?"

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:38.170
Sung Je Yeon.

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:40.540
So, am I still...

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.280
supposed to act like I don't know you?

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:47.250
Were you curious to see too?

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.450
How I turned out?

00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:53.520
I was curious about you too.

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.690
If you'd gone off to college...

00:55:57.590 --> 00:55:58.890
Whatever you became,

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:01.360
I wondered if we would ever meet again.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.070
Stuff like that.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:21.320
(Handle with Caution)

00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:43.940
(Handle with Caution)

00:56:56.890 --> 00:56:59.190
"To Sunwoo Hae, Sung Je Yeon."

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:06.130
"I like you."

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.060
"What about you?"

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:10.130
Who's this?

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.360
Where are you?

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.599
What are you up to?

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.160
Me? I'm practicing arranging the bouquet.

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.800
Why?

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:46.940
Because I miss you.

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:53.709
Hello?

00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:54.910
Should I come over?

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.280
Open the door.

00:57:58.050 --> 00:57:59.710
I'm here.

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:05.890
Gosh, you're really dedicated.

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:11.659
You can't just show up like this. I look like a mess.

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:13.190
Honestly, you're unbelievable.

00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:15.260
I have something for you.

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.660
Hold on.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:23.400
Here.

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.610
I made this thinking of you.

00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:29.980
What is it?

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:34.949
It's a penguin, by the way.

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:37.420
Oh, I knew it. Of course.

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.250
Though I almost couldn't tell.

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.919
- And... - It does look like a penguin.

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.559
- It's cute. - Right.

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:44.859
And this...

00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.330
got mixed in with my things.

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.900
Oh, so that's where it was.

00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:52.729
I was looking all over for this.

00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:54.100
- Thanks. - Gosh!

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:56.869
- What? - No,

00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:58.109
wait until I leave to look at it.

00:58:58.110 --> 00:58:59.110
Why?

00:58:59.111 --> 00:59:01.209
You can look if you drop it by accident and it falls open.

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:03.710
- Why? What is it? Let me see. - No.

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:07.420
Okay, fine. Goodness.

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.420
- What? Wait a second. - What?

00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.619
- Je Yeon. - Yes?

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:13.959
You're burning up.

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.060
I am?

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:16.590
We need to nip this in the bud.

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:19.460
Eat porridge, then take medicine. I make really good porridge.

00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:21.900
Let's not.

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.429
Let's eat something good,

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:26.430
like something salty and sweet.

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:28.200
Something salty and sweet?

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.840
- How about some galbijjim? - Yes.

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:34.210
But doesn't that take a while to make?

00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:35.310
Yes.

00:59:35.311 --> 00:59:37.350
I'll let it marinate overnight, so we can have it tomorrow morning.

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:44.220
Gosh.

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:45.950
You have a very...

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:48.790
appetizing way of asking me to stay over.

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.530
Sweet and savory.

00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:59.269
For today, you'll just have to stick with the porridge.

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:00.370
Okay.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.400
Hey.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.809
No, what if you get sick?

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.440
I'm trying to take it all away from you.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.880
Just stay here for a minute.

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:06.970
Why did you have to say I should see this later?

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.800
If you just hadn't said that...

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.730
"To Sunwoo Hae, Sung Je Yeon."

01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:51.650
"You asked if I had gone to college,"

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.650
"or which path my mom laid out for me I ended up taking."

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.450
"You said you were curious, right?"

01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:04.260
Oh, right. Gosh.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.200
"From the moment we met again,"

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:12.500
"you were asking about how I was."

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.460
Where should I start?

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:38.729
First off,

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:41.100
college wasn't very fun.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:46.170
Just getting to my classes was a struggle,

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.300
and I was barely making ends meet.

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:51.870
And through it all, I kept wondering if this was the right path for me.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.380
But even having those kinds of worries...

01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:56.940
was a luxury I couldn't afford.

01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:06.689
After my family lost everything,

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:08.689
and I had to drop out of school,

01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:10.690
life just went on.

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.929
What in the...

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:14.300
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:15.930
What do you think you're doing?

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.639
I thought you were working as a teaching assistant!

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.100
It wasn't a good fit, so I switched jobs.

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:25.970
What if I was a bad influence on the kids?

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:27.779
You took a break from your studies for this?

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.679
You're not happy with your major, and you don't want to transfer.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.349
Why the sudden rebellious phase? You never even had one as a teen!

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:35.150
Do you want to see your mother collapse from all this?

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:38.620
I'm sorry.

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:53.100
(Notice of Permanent Closure)

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:18.860
"When the water in my pond froze over,"

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:23.200
"I suppose I didn't know where to go."

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.800
(Certificate of University Withdrawal)

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:41.220
Gosh, why is this so hard to open today?

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:45.690
"At times like that,"

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:50.520
"I'd think of the person who lived the most inefficiently."

01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:54.860
"The one who slept when it was time for school..."

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.830
"and worked when it was time to sleep."

01:04:58.530 --> 01:04:59.630
"You."

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.100
"You, eating by yourself on campus."

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:06.970
"You, asking what someone like me dreamed of."

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.180
I was just curious what someone as brilliant as you dreams about.

01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:14.480
"In those moments when you were gone,"

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:17.620
"I realized I missed you."

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.130
"I guess..."

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.360
"I was lonely."

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.380
Je Yeon.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.790
I love you.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:56.680
"To a friend I've drifted apart from."

01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.190
"When the flowers..."

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:01.460
"of that tree are in bloom,"

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.190
"let's go see it together."

01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:49.800

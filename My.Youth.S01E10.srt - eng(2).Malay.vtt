00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.370
(Song Joong Ki)

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.070
(Chun Woo Hee)

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.510
(Lee Joo Myung)

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.510
(Seo Ji Hun)

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.890
(My Youth)

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.059
(Episode 10)

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.430
Oh, okay.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.600
Okay, I'll come by then, and we can talk more.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.600
Okay, thank you so much.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.100
Okay, goodbye.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.910
Who was that so early?

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.380
The hospital.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.850
It's almost time for my check-up.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.260
Did you sleep well?

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.560
Why are you covering up?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.200
I'm too...

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.470
exposed right now?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.240
Oh, come on.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.740
Go back to sleep.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.280
Where are you going?

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.350
To make you some food.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.369
Haven't you started the rice?

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.270
Just wait a minute. I'll get breakfast ready for you.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.050
Should I do it?

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.520
I'm really good at getting the water level just right.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.050
Hold on.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.790
First, let's get your hair dry.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.519
You'll catch a cold. Come on.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.820
What about breakfast?

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.730
I can do it myself.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.630
Because I want to.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.170
Stop being awkward and just accept it.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.870
Okay.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.080
This mole on the back of your neck...

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.549
Here. No, right here.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.950
Hey! That tickles.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.849
You read the letter, didn't you?

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.050
Traitor.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.090
Wasn't the plan for you to find it by accident?

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.759
It was a masterpiece.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.060
The spelling was perfect and everything?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.600
But...

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.470
the stationery looked like it was from a long time ago.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.069
The person who wrote the beginning...

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.140
didn't feel like the same person I'm with now.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.440
What are your plans for today?

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.579
Practicing arranging the bouquet.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.649
In that case, I'll work on the wedding script.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.849
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.649
- You got this. Don't be nervous! - Come with me.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.889
- Spray some water on that. - Here, put it on.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.489
- Put it on. - Thanks.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.560
Nu Ri, let's do a chant too.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.760
All right.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.499
One, two, three!

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.700
- You got this! - You got this!

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.369
- Thank you. - Hurry inside.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.840
- Thank you. - You'll do great.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.500
- Okay, I'm off. - Okay.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.910
I'm so nervous.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.980
Should I go grab some coffee?

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.409
Give you two some privacy.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.619
I'm going to go get one for myself.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.750
I'll have a hot coffee.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.149
In that case,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.819
I'll have an English Breakfast milk tea with no sugar.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.220
Around 165 degrees, so I can drink it immediately.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.859
Would that be too much to ask?

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.230
You're a real piece of work.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.060
What?

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.000
You know...

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.070
I may have gotten older, but I don't feel like I've grown up.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.950
Most days, I needed someone to comfort me,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.020
and you were always there for me.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.090
In the end,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.490
I just end up right back here next to you.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.230
I guess to other people, my life must seem pretty pathetic.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.730
But I don't care what other people think.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.670
As long as you don't see me that way.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.080
Are you wearing that perfume? The one I like?

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.510
Yes.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.080
I figured even if you tire of me, you'd still like this scent.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.949
You can be a bit much sometimes.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.050
Liar.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.160
Gosh, you're something else.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.290
And I guess I am, too.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.130
I'm starting to feel a little better.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.900
I guess this is why they say you need a kid in the house.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.870
Using him as an excuse to just patch things up so easily.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.900
I never would've done that in the past.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.409
Come on.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.110
I thought we were finally starting to feel like a real married couple.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.580
You think so? A real married couple?

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.650
What?

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:53.890
Can I help you find something?

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.659
Oh, I need to buy a textbook for my English class.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.129
Where's the foreign language...

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.730
Oh, my gosh. What was that?

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.699
Gi Ppeum, what are you doing here?

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.530
I just stopped by for a bit before my class.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.039
It's so nice having a bookstore near the office.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.010
You must come here a lot. You still don't have your license.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.309
I just keep failing the on-road test.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.509
I'll get it eventually.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.910
The foreign language section is this way.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.650
So, Gi Ppeum, what did you buy?

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.719
Oh, well...

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.549
I was just buying Tae Rin's magazine.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.490
But that's not out for a while.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.960
But the thought is very delicious.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.230
So, what did you buy that you have to hide?

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.900
Well, the thing is...

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.910
I just like homemaking.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.439
If you like it, why hide it? Are you ashamed?

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.580
No, I'm not ashamed at all.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.980
It's just that older people say that if a man works in the kitchen,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.919
something important will fall off.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.780
I've never seen any studies that show that.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.850
Maybe I missed that study?

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.120
I mean, I can't even find my own textbook right now.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.730
I told you, it's this way.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.300
I guess you have no sense of direction.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.370
Oh, you're here!

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.809
The security guard was saying...

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.010
that some guy's been lurking around every night for the past few days.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.750
When you're coming and going, check in with me or Gi Ppeum.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.950
- You never know. - Okay.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.150
Right. When's the press conference for the show again?

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.619
"Femmicide for Love?"

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.430
That's still a few weeks away...

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.599
Are you prepping for the promotion schedule already?

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.069
Of course. You have to be prepared.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.470
I was so lean during filming. I can't show up looking all bloated.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.480
- Anything popular. - What's the most popular?

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.309
Something like instant rice.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.510
Oh, Nu Ri!

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.120
Great job today.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.980
Kimchi!

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.020
Oh, come stand over here.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.129
Let me get a picture of you with this background.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.130
Should we?

00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:10.600
- Come on, over here. - Goodness.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.460
- Let me get a shot. - Okay.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.770
One, two, three!

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.010
Give me a break. Goodness.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.779
They said they can't make the milk tea without sugar.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.450
What? Why can't they just leave out the sugar?

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.020
Well, I guess I'll manage. Thanks.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.350
Oh, that looks heavy. Here, let me get it.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:35.650
- Here. - Thanks.

00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:37.019
I'm just going to use the restroom.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.160
- I'll drink it when I get back. - Okay.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.470
Oh, it's cold now.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.070
How was your practical exam?

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.970
Oh, should I not have asked?

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.110
To be honest, I'm not really sure.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.880
I think my mind was just all over the place the whole time.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.650
Thinking about meeting my mom.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.329
You know, this is how art is.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.330
It's born from anguish.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.870
So you decided to meet your mom.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.570
Yes.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.369
Actually, Hae came to see me.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.909
Gosh, he was furious.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.709
No way. He found out because of you...

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.880
I had a huge fight with him because of that.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.049
What are you going to do about this?

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.350
I'm sorry.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:44.090
Why even make a secret if you couldn't keep it?

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.490
I guess your mom is doing better for herself now.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.499
When that happens,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.830
all that longing you pushed aside comes rushing back.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.040
That's what happened to me.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.069
For me to...

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.380
to expect Hae to forgive me...

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.110
is asking for too much, isn't it?

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.680
Yes, well...

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.719
If he's going to hate me anyway,

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.619
I might as well take it while doing everything I can for him.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.189
If you're going to do it, you must be tough and see it through.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.690
Don't give up until the very end.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.230
- You can do it! - You can do it.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.039
Maybe I should have used preserved flowers.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.269
I mean, fresh flowers eventually wilt.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.979
"To all the distinguished guests who have joined us today..."

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.980
No, wait.

00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:43.779
Maybe I should've used lily of the valley?

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.819
If it's a simple ceremony, the bouquet should be simple.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.790
"Today's ceremony will be held without an officiant."

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.259
Oh, no.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.499
No. It should be...

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.370
"Thank you all for taking the time to be here."

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.339
You don't even have me on your mind.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.970
Sung Je Yeon, honestly...

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.810
"The star of the show."

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.820
Let's give a warm round of applause as we welcome the bride.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.960
Okay, and now, the groom will make his entrance.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.500
Please, welcome the groom.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.160
Hey.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.730
Here I am making this bouquet, and you're right here next to me,

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.130
writing all that.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.900
You can't blame me for getting ideas.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.740
The groom is supposed to enter first.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.850
You're getting me all mixed up.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.850
The bride is the star of the show.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.450
Even at a time like this,

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.190
you can still focus.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.590
I guess that's how you got into Seoul National University.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.200
Focus.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.340
Stop it.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.040
Go back to focusing.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.980
Just stay still.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.380
Hey, stop it.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.880
Stop.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.520
Don't.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.220
Hey, I said stop!

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.730
You really have a knack for getting attention.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.500
You mean you didn't want me to?

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.470
Just tell me, and I'll do it.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.139
- You mean it? - But...

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.680
what's this business card?

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.749
Is this from when you moved the chairs?

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.149
If you're not going to kiss me, then just drop it.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.450
Fine.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.390
Whatever.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.160
Se said she wants to meet.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.290
She was asking about the publication rights.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.229
If you're okay with it,

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.160
it would be better than selling to a scam artist.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.499
The director's a much better option.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.069
Besides, she was always well-known for content development.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.239
When are you going to meet her?

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.639
I was thinking sometime soon.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.770
But thanks to you, now I'm having second thoughts.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.380
Suit yourself.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.750
Sung Je Yeon.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.080
Sung Je Yeon.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.119
You are so infuriating.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.749
You're ridiculous now that we're dating.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.620
What's so ridiculous?

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.520
What's so ridiculous?

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.559
- Hold on. Who is it? - I don't know.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.329
Didn't you say your sister wouldn't be home till late?

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.229
I told her to stay out late with that jerk.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.440
Stay here.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.040
What? You're here?

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.979
Why do you just show up without even calling...

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.609
and let yourself in like that?

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.479
You think I wanted to come? Mom sent a package for you.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.720
Here. Eat up and get lost. This goes in the fridge.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.090
Hello.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.400
Goodness. I'm so sorry, I was right behind you.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.970
Hey, this is Nu Ri's. I'll put them...

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.639
- over here. - What?

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.840
What is this?

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.780
What is this?

00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:14.149
How dare you point your finger? You'd better put that hand down.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.390
I said, what is this?

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.360
After all the years you two haven't seen each other...

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.190
Gosh, fate is really something.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.659
It works out so easily.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.860
"Easily?"

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.069
We confessed our feelings a total of four times,

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.569
and she only agreed after turning me down three times.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.769
Does that sound easy to you?

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.270
Oh, like the story of the three visits?

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.439
Hey, even Liu Bei only visited Zhuge Liang three times.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.509
Really? That happened to Zhuge Liang?

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.880
He sounds like a stand-up guy.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.320
Just go on in after her.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.389
You know she likes it.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.420
Give me a minute.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.119
Seok Joo, do you want a tangerine?

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.630
You can have Hae's share too.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.230
So, how have you been?

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.430
Is the restaurant still pretty slow?

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.370
Don't you guys have team dinners at your company?

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.810
We always welcome large parties.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.640
Sure.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.579
As if that's something to brag about.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.050
Spilling our embarrassing story to Kim Seok Joo.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.990
Am I less than Zhuge Liang or something?

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.919
No, it's just...

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.230
It's because Seok Joo made it sound so weird.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.660
It's not like we got together easily.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.460
You know we didn't.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.070
I can't stay here, I'm so embarrassed.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.210
So then...

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.480
How do I get out of here without making it weird?

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.349
Wait, hold on.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.079
Should we pretend to have a fight?

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.520
But then Geon No would worry.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.419
Let's just say something urgent came up for me.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.890
Why should you leave? They should be the ones to go.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.200
They probably don't know we can hear them.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.870
Gosh. He's crazy about her.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.639
Something urgent just came up.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.210
I think I should get going now.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.680
I'll see you around.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.680
Hey, aren't we rescheduling our driving practice?

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.449
I really have to pass this time. My mom found out.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:29.920
Hey, that's because you...

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:36.059
You're making it sound like it's my fault you failed your test.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.290
Figure it out yourself.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.360
Sung Je Yeon.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:41.799
Will you be okay getting home alone?

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.200
Yes, of course.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.070
- Okay. - I'm heading out.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.670
See you.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.180
Bye.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.449
You heard all of that?

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:03.690
Loud and clear.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.390
Didn't you want us to hear it?

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.330
I want to be alone.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:09.990
Everybody, get out.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.400
I was leaving anyway. This is ridiculous.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.840
Hae.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.610
Can I have one of these supplements?

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.350
No, you can't. You have nutritional overload.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.019
I may not look it, but I'm running on fumes.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.620
I said no!

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.729
What? Is it really that good?

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.930
Knock yourself out.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.369
Does Seok Joo still not know?

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.769
It's not good news. Why go telling everyone?

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:53.969
It'll just scare him.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.340
So he can find out on his own, just like I did?

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.039
The way you leave your pills around, he's going to find out soon.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.480
I meant to take it earlier, but I forgot.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.220
I need to go to the doctor's too.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.690
Maybe it'd be better if I just went with Seok Joo?

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:13.960
Good grief.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:16.659
It's been a while!

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.900
Long time no see.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.300
- How have you been? - Good.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.570
Hey, sorry to bother you on your time off.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.399
It's the audition for "World Made of Ash 3."

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.239
Oh, it's fine. You're here on a weekend, too.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.579
Is it an audition for high schoolers?

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.739
Yes. Sang Yeop from your team.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.750
Since they're young, I need him to follow them.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.780
Here's the audition script and...

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.249
Got it.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.589
Okay, I'll book a practice room then.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.050
I have to make a good tape to send over.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.960
Gosh, you're a lifesaver.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.290
How've you been?

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.859
You're glowing. The time off must've done you good.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.699
Gosh. I guess it shows?

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.040
Well, I have good reason to.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.639
Hey, come back to work already. You're making me jealous. Here.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.869
Okay.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.070
Oh, right.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.839
Did you hear about "Kongjwi and Patjwi?"

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.209
Apparently, things are a mess over there.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.149
The actress playing Patjwi suddenly dropped out.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.649
Oh, no. Aren't they already filming?

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.650
They're in a mad scramble to find a replacement.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.390
We don't have any actors who'd be a good fit.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.560
Hey, could I have the script? You have it, right?

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.299
The female lead is a third-generation chaebol.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.169
But at the start of the show, she falls so madly in love...

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.499
that she throws it all away.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.439
She could just go back and inherit it all anyway.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.339
I'm sure part of why he likes her is because she's rich.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.469
The number of chaebol characters is a reflection of our society's...

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:37.669
Here we go with the social critique.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.379
I'm not allowed to criticize it?

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.880
Gosh, let's just order some food.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.380
Tae Rin, salad for you?

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.980
I don't care anymore.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:47.720
Chicken feet.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.919
With extra glass noodles.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.519
Rice balls. No, on second thought.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.089
We have to make fried rice in the sauce...

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:54.930
Wait, hold on a second.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.060
Oh, this...

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.470
I actually made this at home and brought it in.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.939
What? Gi Ppeum, you can cook?

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.510
Oh, no. I just enjoy it.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.279
And Tae Rin, this one is for you.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.710
I made it low-calorie.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.610
Thank you, Gi Ppeum.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:18.849
Looks so delicious.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:19.920
This one's for everyone.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.789
- Amazing. - Oh, that's a relief.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.559
I wish our manuscript submissions were this good.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.430
I'm sure something that stands out will come along eventually.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.230
Eventually?

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.240
Thank you for the food, Gi Ppeum. This is really delicious.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.080
Gosh, it's freezing.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:55.950
What?

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.500
I finally caught up with you.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.070
What is it? Why are you...

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.300
You're the solicitor the security guard mentioned.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.509
Gosh. That security guard.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.979
After giving him three coffees, he calls me a solicitor?

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.309
You've come here three times?

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:23.679
Today was my third.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.380
The first day, I was just loitering and got chewed out.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.220
So I explained the situation,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.019
and he even gave me some snacks.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.789
Then why didn't you just come inside?

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.820
You know everyone in there anyway.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.860
That's exactly why I couldn't.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:37.660
I'm...

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.700
I'm part of your personal life.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.770
Can I get your number?

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.509
I came because I wanted to ask you in person.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.880
So you've been doing this for days?

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.450
Weren't you cold?

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.880
Of course, it was freezing.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.250
So when are you free?

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.690
I'll check my schedule and let you know.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.000
Do you need a ride?

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.739
No, I still have some work to finish.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.240
I have to head back to the office.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.640
I'll get going.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.010
What was that?

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.290
He's kind of cute.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.589
Oh, right.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:42.090
Hey, you've heard of Kim Anmin Books, right?

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.730
If you have the CEO's contact information...

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.930
They went bankrupt?

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.070
Prison?

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.800
Oh, so does that mean their publishing rights are void?

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.610
What's the exact book you want to republish?

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.740
- Goodness. - I'll see what I can find out.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.579
Actually, a production company is adapting it into a film,

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.680
so they've probably already handled the rights.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.750
Yes, I'll figure it out on my own.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:08.990
Okay.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.900
(Resignation)

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.270
I know this just goes to the HR department.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.000
But still...

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.010
I wanted to see you...

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.740
and give you this letter I wrote myself.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.250
Oh, I got this for you on my trip.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.420
You went on a trip and felt like buying me a gift?

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.449
Don't you hate me?

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.550
No.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.420
During the past six years at my first job,

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.430
There were more good times than bad.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:53.060
And that includes you.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.500
I would've been hurt if you'd just submitted this to HR and left.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.240
I'll make sure to wrap up the rest of the auditions.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.180
Je Yeon.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.090
I was very fond of you.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.020
I know.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:24.790
I hope you won't let yourself be so lonely.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.319
- Are you okay? - Yes.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.679
Who's going to train me now?

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.220
I emailed an updated manual to the team.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.959
Hello.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.889
Oh, hello.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.729
Here. These are for you.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.499
Please take good care of her.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.700
- Please have some of these... - Wait, are you Hae's father?

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.070
- I'm sorry, who are you? - Oh, my apologies.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.569
Yes, I'm the CEO's...

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.140
better half. No, wait.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.379
- I'm her husband. - I see.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.879
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.080
Oh, that's all right.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:18.010
There are more people inside, right?

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.380
Hello.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.249
- Oh, you're her friend. - Yes.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.689
It's been a long time.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.889
How have you been?

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.419
Here, have some of these pastries.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.630
Gosh, thank you.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.429
What are you doing here?

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.399
What do you think you're doing? Who let you in?

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.269
I just told them I was your husband.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.200
Your secretary sent me right up.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:39.939
Oh, honestly!

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.540
You're even more beautiful when you're at work.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:44.810
Honey!

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.609
How can you be this beautiful?

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.410
- You're even more... - Let's go inside. Now.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.249
- What? - Get over here!

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.349
But I was just greeting...

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.090
All right, keep up the great work!

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.090
Go team!

00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.259
Oh, just a second.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.920
I was supposed to give this to them.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.059
I can't tell if this is cute or just plain crazy.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.460
You're the publisher who was meant to come by this afternoon?

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.029
Well, I couldn't show up empty-handed.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.470
So I made a bit of an effort.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.800
Honey, this is delicious. Here, have one.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.739
So, why are you here, Mr. Publisher?

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.210
Oh, well...

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.380
Should we maybe sit down?

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.480
It's just that...

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.489
I heard the original novel for your movie is out of print.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.259
I came here today because my company would like to republish it.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.160
You mean, your son's novel.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.329
If it's republished when it hits theaters,

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.400
the cross-promotion would be great. There's no downside.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.769
But is he even interested in republishing it?

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:48.939
I'm going to prepare a backup plan first,

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.640
and then I'll try to meet with him.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.479
But I feared you'd be uncomfortable, so I wanted to ask you first.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.880
Why would I be uncomfortable? It's just business.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:58.979
I just hope...

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.390
you can persuade the author.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.860
I came up with all these other pitches just to persuade you.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.659
That's why I brought all these snacks and everything.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.459
That actually had the opposite effect.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.930
Let's not do that again.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.800
Oh, right.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.369
I haven't even passed out the letters I wrote.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.800
I'm just going to step out for a...

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.509
Just keep these to yourself.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:24.309
Don't hand them out. Please.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.540
But I was up all night writing...

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.650
Honey.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.480
Oh, Honey.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.850
Oh, Honey...

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.160
Gosh. What's with all the studying?

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.499
So how'd your practical exam go?

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.530
Did it go well?

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.030
How should I know? The judges are the ones who decide.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.669
What are you looking for?

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:53.800
Found it.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.550
I'm going to give your mom an old photo of you.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.720
To show her how you've grown up.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:07.950
Seriously.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:10.720
So cute.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.420
You were so adorable.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.230
Stop it.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.630
Any idea where she is now?

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:25.839
Knock it off.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.399
No, seriously, I haven't seen her around lately.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.409
- Seriously, where did she go? - I told you to stop!

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.579
- Nu Ri! - I told you to knock it off!

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.909
- What's your problem? - Nu Ri, where'd you go?

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:36.910
Nu Ri!

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.749
What? I didn't push you that hard.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.090
Don't be so dramatic.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.690
What is it?

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.360
Are you really hurt?

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.760
Hae.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.060
What's wrong?

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.200
What?

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.700
Who are you?

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.270
Excuse me.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.709
Have you happened to see Nu Ri?

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:06.940
She looks like this.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.480
Seriously.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.479
Don't talk to me for a whole week.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.679
What's with you?

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.079
Excuse me. Have you seen her?

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.050
Nu Ri, you need to come home now!

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:48.220
Call me when you're done. I'll come pick you up.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:56.630
- Hey, Nu Ri. - Yes?

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.200
Here.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.040
- Hello. - Hello.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.600
- Oh, you're here. - Hello.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:20.640
- Where's Sang Yeop? - He's in traffic, so he'll be late.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.579
Okay, then. As I mentioned in the group chat,

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.880
you'll all be partnering up with each other today.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.920
And you'll each get an hour for individual practice.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.490
Any questions?

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.460
Are you quitting the company?

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:37.330
Yes.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.600
This is the last thing I have to do here.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.670
I'll set you up with the audition schedules, so don't worry.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:46.370
Okay, for now, let's get to practice.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:57.150
Yes, it's me.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:58.979
What are you doing the day after tomorrow?

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.280
Why?

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:05.020
I'm not feeling too well, so I have to go to the doctor.

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.489
I was hoping you could come with me.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.460
Aren't you a little old to need a chaperone?

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.890
Are you going under anesthesia?

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.989
I can't drive you anyway, you know that.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.800
If I needed a driver, I wouldn't have called you, would I?

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:16.629
Come on, just do this for me.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.300
But I have plans that day.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.899
What time's your appointment?

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.139
I'll work around your schedule.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.070
I'll text you. Thanks.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:25.880
Yes.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.980
Unbelievable.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:30.280
("Kongjwi and Patjwi")

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.459
Instead of a rose, how about I put you in the vase?

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.630
All blood-red?

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.530
- This is so good. - Who do you think you are?

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.300
I'm just going to...

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.699
If you don't want to lose to him, you've got to...

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.069
Director, when are you available?

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.210
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:12.690
Hey.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.430
Can I...

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.330
stay over with my mom tonight?

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.340
I just want to talk with her a little longer.

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.870
Yes, sure.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:31.239
Do you need a ride?

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.880
She said she drove.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.010
Alright.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:39.720
Get something good to eat with your mom.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.050
I'll make sure to eat well, too.

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.760
What are you doing? Go on, she must be waiting.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.030
- Okay. - You have a good meal.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.680
"After all that trouble to sell it, I even had to process a refund."

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.380
"If anyone has the right to be angry over a speck of dust, it's me."

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.249
- She's going to get the role. - "Why is she the one complaining?"

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.080
"I can't believe you said that. I swear, I could just..."

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.360
Who is it?

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.130
Delivery. You ordered the chicken feet, right?

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:28.060
What? I didn't order any...

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:30.230
Sunwoo Hae?

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.200
What?

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.810
It's a delivery.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:38.810
Wait, no...

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.410
Why are you here all of a sudden? How did you even get here?

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.580
Well...

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.450
Wait.

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:51.390
Gosh.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.890
So this is what your place looks like.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:57.489
Seriously, why did you just show up without saying anything?

00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:58.830
You can't just show up like this.

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.070
So, you ordered the chicken feet, right?

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.139
Since it's my first time here, I was wondering what to get you.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.609
Right, you can always use toilet paper.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:10.610
Thanks.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.739
I mean it.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.610
But really, why are you here all of a sudden?

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.480
Because I missed you.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.450
Hey, stop it. You're making my heart race.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:28.819
But I have to finish reviewing this.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.860
I won't take up much of your time. I just...

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:34.060
wanted to see your face before I headed home.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:36.629
- Perfect. - What?

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.869
This just got delivered today.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.069
I noticed you didn't have one when I was at your place last time.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:42.670
It's a must-have for modern life.

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:44.070
Take it with you since you're here.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:45.810
What is it?

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.979
- A robot vacuum? - Yes.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.309
Hey, this is so expensive...

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:54.480
No, it's fine. I got a really good deal on it.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.520
I can just clean myself.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.319
Seriously, you need to return this.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.420
Really?

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:05.229
- I mean it. - But this is...

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.959
They say it's super convenient.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.000
Seriously, Sung Je Yeon.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:11.000
Oh, right.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.339
I bought this for you.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.240
- What is it? - Here.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:18.910
What is this?

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.650
Oh, my gosh, what is this?

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:29.019
- It's so pretty. - A ladle rest.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.319
I got it for a great price, 50 dollars.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.720
What? This was 50 dollars?

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.929
Hey, you're the one who needs to return something, okay?

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:39.530
Don't be ridiculous.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.900
Hold on, I just have to take this call.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:46.840
Yes, hello?

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.610
Yes, I was just watching it.

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.579
Let me finish reviewing this, and then we can video call.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:53.610
Okay.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.779
Anyway, it's not much, but please have a seat.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.519
Can I get you some coffee or something?

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.820
No, I'm okay.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:04.420
You get back to work. I'll get going.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.360
Yes?

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:08.860
Well...

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.360
When's your doctor's appointment?

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.140
Do you want me to go with you?

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.070
I've got plenty of time.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.410
Doesn't look like it.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.280
Don't worry.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.119
Seok Joo already said he'd go with me.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.950
Well, then...

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.460
How about we meet up after your appointment?

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.160
I'll treat you to something good.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.560
Yes, with the money I get from returning this.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.060
In that case...

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:50.669
You remember that place I said had amazing food?

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.669
Back when I was loading trucks.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.870
Sounds good.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.910
Okay, I'm really leaving now.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.770
Bye.

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:02.980
Don't go.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:11.349
Hello.

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:12.690
- Hello. - What?

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.359
Oh, it's just you, Gi Ppeum?

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.259
The other two are on a smoke break right now.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.630
- Have a seat. - Okay.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.429
- You're here. - Yes.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:23.030
You're looking good.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:24.530
You think so?

00:39:24.531 --> 00:39:26.940
I guess I'm pretty happy these days.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.479
I wonder why you're so happy, and I think I know why.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.910
Oh, please.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:36.780
Oh, hold on. I just got a text.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.319
Forget the driving practice.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.950
I'm just going to give you that stock tip I promised and be done.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:43.490
Let's meet up after work.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:45.490
Deal.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.819
Who was that? Kim Seok Joo?

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.590
Yes. I've got a debt to collect.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:50.989
You need to stop paying attention to him.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:52.659
How can I ignore one of my fans?

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.559
- He said he's your fan? - Yes!

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.069
He was so shy, even when they were just taking a picture.

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.499
Okay, enough about Kim Seok Joo.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.070
So, you heard the actress playing Patjwi dropped out, right?

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.509
That role...

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:08.480
Couldn't Tae Rin do it?

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:12.309
What do you think, Director?

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:14.179
Actually, their team reached out yesterday.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.790
They called to ask about Mo Tae Rin's availability.

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:21.319
With Kwon Do Eun and Director Han, it's too good a project to pass up.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.359
It's a great project, so I wanted Tae Rin to do it too.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.600
Goodness.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.729
Well, look at that. We finally agree on something.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:32.370
But joining a project mid-shoot at this stage...

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:34.839
is a lot of pressure on my actor.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.070
But what if I say...

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.710
I still want to do it?

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:42.610
What would that mean?

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.180
Well...

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:46.720
Let's go.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.219
Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.250
I couldn't stop thinking about it, either.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:55.759
If we meet them and they decide I'm not a good fit,

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.060
then there's nothing we can do about it.

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:59.200
Let's go see them.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.330
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.570
Let's go.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.440
(Wanmi Jokbal)

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.209
Seriously, why insist on meeting for something you could've texted?

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.580
There's a reason I want to meet in person.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:18.850
This is good.

00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:21.150
If you're going to eat, eat well.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.220
Hey, watch and learn.

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:27.959
You put it on top, see?

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.160
Then you take this...

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:30.990
and dip it.

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.560
You dip it in the soybean powder.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.469
When you know how to do something,

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.939
you always have to show off and ruin it.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.140
Like with your driving.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.940
So good.

00:41:48.941 --> 00:41:50.150
Goodness grief.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.950
Do you think I'd do well in the entertainment industry?

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.290
You?

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:59.120
Don't even think about it.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:06.260
What? Are you serious?

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.700
If you're being serious, then...

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:13.370
Forget it.

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:16.740
I mean, nothing in life is easy,

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.169
but you don't have the stomach for it.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:19.340
All you've ever done is study.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:25.180
Come on, just stick to your numbers.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.780
Do you think my mom would let me?

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.220
I shouldn't have bailed that day.

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:44.470
Hey.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:45.769
Just give me one move.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:47.300
I don't think one move is going to do it.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.970
Then how many, exactly?

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.810
Geon No, I'm here!

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:53.079
Oh, hi.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.809
What brings you here?

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:56.509
I was craving Geon No's food.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:57.649
I see.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.280
I don't know when I'll get another chance.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:01.349
I'm going to Australia.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:02.550
"Australia?"

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.219
- What? - Don't ask.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.359
I already bought my ticket, so don't try to stop me.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.789
Goodbye, Korea!

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:12.390
Wait, no. Were you serious about leaving?

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:15.729
- Really? - Please don't go!

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:17.070
Please don't go.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:18.930
Oh, no.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:20.969
You spilled everything.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:23.569
Geon No, what's gotten into you? You're being dramatic.

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:25.709
It's not like we saw each other all that often.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.579
But you came by for rice wine a few times.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.209
I was actually really proud and happy about it.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:31.580
Exactly, stay and drink with us. Where do you think you're going?

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.420
You don't even speak English.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.180
Hey!

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.790
Do you want me to give you the bookstore?

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:39.119
You can just go and clean it once in a while.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.519
I'm not getting rid of it. It was my grandma's dying wish.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.730
No.

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.559
Goodness.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.630
Look at you, pouting again. Hae.

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:50.029
Come visit Australia with Geon No.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.200
I'll be a master surfer by then.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.139
- Geon No. - Yes?

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.639
You knocked that over on purpose, didn't you?

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.840
Let's start over.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:02.710
- Excuse me. - Yes?

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:05.449
Are you sure you can make it home on your own?

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:07.420
You had a lot of that rice wine earlier.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.490
Gosh, you reek.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.419
Come on, I'll walk you home.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.989
Oh, come on, really!

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:14.460
It's just right up ahead.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.490
Hey.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.729
You kept telling me to clean the bookstore,

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:21.830
so while I was...

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.430
You wrote this.

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.940
What am I supposed to do when I miss you?

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:39.149
It's just so far away.

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:40.980
We can just video call.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.420
Come on, stop. You're being so cheesy.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.520
I'm leaving.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:50.990
Hey.

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:53.200
Let me walk you home.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.860
Hey!

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:07.340
(Yeonjung University Hospital)

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:10.350
How have you been feeling lately?

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:12.949
Do you have any abnormal sensations or dizziness?

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:15.950
They've been happening a little more often lately.

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.189
Have you been taking your medication regularly?

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:19.919
- Yes. - And you haven't had...

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.390
- any vomiting after taking it? - No.

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.530
There's a clinical trial that's about to start.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:28.300
It's not in the country.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.500
Your case is exceptionally rare,

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.299
and while a complete cure might not be possible,

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.470
we may be able to ease the severity of your symptoms.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:50.750
Hey.

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:52.550
Hey, Seok Joo.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.420
Hey.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:59.500
Look, instead of me trying to explain it,

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.160
I thought it best if you heard it directly from the doctor.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:04.229
You're shocked, aren't you?

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:05.530
Of course, I am.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.039
Does Nu Ri know you're sick?

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.939
Nu Ri has her college entrance exams coming up.

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:12.470
It would just get in the way of her studying.

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:13.680
Goodness.

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.750
The disease only started progressing recently.

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:21.750
For a long time now, I think I knew this day would come.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.920
I just...

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:27.219
didn't want you to be too shocked if something happened to me.

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.389
You think knowing means I won't be shocked?

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:31.029
It just means I'm shocked now instead of later.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.160
No, but you...

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.700
Do you know why I liked you so much?

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:38.800
For me,

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.600
it's because you made my life a little more complicated.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.640
It's because you accepted me for who I am.

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:47.780
But now...

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.680
It's your life that's getting complicated.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.730
There was a time when it was simple, too.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.140
Thanks to you.

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:19.210
You should go.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.010
I don't want you to see me fall apart.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:24.510
You're really leaving?

00:47:24.511 --> 00:47:26.480
I said go.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:51.170
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable...

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.610
Are you sure you gave me the right address?

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.110
This is a hospital.

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:26.510
Are you crying?

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:56.040
What do you want me to do?

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:00.880
I've been there, so I know.

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:04.080
Not just rushing in and asking why they're crying...

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.910
or trying to comfort them.

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.250
Sometimes, they just want to be left alone.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:20.500
I'm just going to do my own thing.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.730
It's so cold out, you're going to turn into an icicle.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:00.500
It's so cold.

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.500
Gosh, it's freezing.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:12.410
Do you...

00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:15.680
Do you drink?

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.990
Do you eat chicken feet?

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:19.990
Yes, I guess.

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.760
Seriously? These things?

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.800
You've arrived at your destination.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.069
Route guidance is finished.

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:38.010
- Is this it? - Yes.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.009
The GPS says it is.

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:43.149
It's not like they just remodeled, right?

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:44.650
Maybe it closed down?

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.019
Well, the food wasn't that great anyway.

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.320
- I thought you said it was good. - I take it back.

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:52.219
- What did they serve again? - Korean home-style food.

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:55.489
What? That sounds amazing!

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:58.060
How many side dishes were there? What was the main course?

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.429
Calm down, let's just go inside.

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:01.460
You must be hungry.

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:03.700
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.539
I ordered us some ice cream, too.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.210
Of course, you did. Good call.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.510
Hey, by the way...

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:15.810
How'd you get the time off? It's a weekday.

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:19.609
Yes, aside from prepping for an audition, I'm pretty free.

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:20.620
I see.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.950
Aren't you curious why I have so much free time?

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:27.660
Of course, I am.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:31.060
When it comes to you, I want to know everything.

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:32.790
I...

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.470
I quit my job.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.299
What?

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.570
Don't worry, I left on good terms.

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:46.610
Now, I'm worried.

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:49.179
How am I supposed to feed us?

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.110
You eat so much.

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:55.550
Just don't let me starve. I love a good bowl of rice.

00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:57.919
Of all the times,

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.290
for that restaurant to go out of business...

00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:01.160
They had great rice there.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:05.360
I thought if I quit,

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:07.530
I'd feel, I don't know...

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.830
Like I'd be lost again like I was before.

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:12.570
But somehow...

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.740
It's just this feeling...

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.270
I think...

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:22.580
You look relieved.

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:24.380
Yes.

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:26.350
Yes.

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.380
- I think that's it. - Yes.

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:34.790
I'm not sure where being unemployed is going to lead me.

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.990
But...

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:38.890
I have you.

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.000
It's just that...

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.270
when you have a landmark,

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:49.070
it makes for a pretty good guide.

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.009
I'm the landmark?

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:52.710
No, you're the Bulguksa Temple.

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:58.310
How is that supposed to guide you? You need someone on my level.

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:00.580
Wait. Hang on a second.

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:05.089
What? Who is it?

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:06.120
Sang Yeop.

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.189
What a great kid.

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:09.420
That's great to hear.

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.260
It's nothing.

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:23.439
"Je Yeon. Thanks for everything."

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.409
"I'll make sure to pass the audition."

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:26.840
"See you then. You got this too, Je Yeon!"

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:31.180
Seriously, does "You got this" really need a heart emoji?

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:34.649
He still hasn't done his military service?

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:36.949
He has to do one more project first.

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:40.059
And it would be perfect if that was "World Made of Ash 3"

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:42.819
Can the author even have a say in the casting?

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.390
- No. - I should've put it in my contract.

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:48.260
Don't text him back.

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:50.899
If you text back, when he's on some long march in the army,

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.570
all he'll be thinking about is you. Just don't do it.

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:53.800
What? Would that be so bad?

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.999
It's not okay with me.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.070
- He's just a kid. - Absolutely not.

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:00.510
What? It's just purely business.

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:02.809
Fine. I'll do it right here in front of you.

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:05.850
Here. "Great job, Sang Yeop."

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:07.350
Whatever. I'm not looking.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:10.420
What's taking our order so long?

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:13.360
I'm going to go check on it.

00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:15.360
Finish up with that by the time I get back.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.330
Yes, sir.

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:18.560
And one more thing.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.130
No long paragraphs.

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:22.060
Keep it short and simple.

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:24.869
Goodness.

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:26.370
Where did the long march come from?

00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:28.039
Thank you.

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.070
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:31.970
There.

00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:15.720
What's wrong? Are you dizzy?

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.220
Yes.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.450
I think my blood sugar is low.

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.320
Here, you should eat some of this first.

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:25.260
I'm just going to go wash my face.

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.460
I can't tell if my blood sugar is low or if I'm just sleepy.

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:32.270
- I'll be fine after I wash my face. - Wait.

00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:35.639
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.969
Where? To the men's room?

00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:39.070
Yes.

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:41.710
I've wanted to see one since I was a kid.

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:45.480
Please, just stay here.

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.849
And don't wait for me right outside either.

00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.020
I'll be right back.

00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:18.470
Looks like the restroom is under construction.

00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:21.040
I'll have to take the long way around.

00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:24.250
Maybe this isn't the right way.

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:29.749
Excuse me.

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:32.149
How many restrooms are there here?

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:34.589
There's one on every floor. And they don't have a passcode.

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:36.889
Are any of them under construction?

00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:39.330
No, they're all working just fine.

00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:41.200
Thank you.

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.730
Of course. Thank you.

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:43.550
You're back?

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:53.390
So...

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:55.230
Don't get mad,

00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.030
just calm down and hear me out.

01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:03.500
There's a really good explanation.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.810
Okay.

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.240
This place is just so big,

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.850
and I've never been here before.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:17.220
I was completely lost.

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.850
I told you I should've gone with you.

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:22.090
You have a terrible sense of direction, don't you?

01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:23.790
Yes, I do.

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:33.300
From now on, I guess I'll have to just do what you say.

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:37.270
Except for coming to the men's room with me.

01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:38.710
I won't.

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:40.510
I'm not curious anymore.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.340
It's snowing.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.980
- Oh, you're right. - Hey, it's snowing.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.320
So it is.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.560
Looks like the first snow of the season.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.930
I guess so.

01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:28.220
Honey, it's snowing.

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:31.560
You should look out the window instead of at those papers.

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.460
It's snowing.

01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:37.470
Do you think it'll stick?

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:40.400
If it does, we should build a snowman.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.210
Sure.

01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:54.820
The whole world is going to turn white.

01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:01.289
- Thank you. - Enjoy. Thanks.

01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:03.460
- Have a good one! - You too. Thanks.

01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.010
Come on, time to eat.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.120
Gi Ppeum.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:34.759
Aren't you hungry?

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.489
Didn't you say you'd finish that today?

01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:37.690
After I eat.

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:41.859
Oh, right. I'll finish it after I eat.

01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.160
- I got it. - Okay?

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:48.000
Here, you can eat while you read.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.970
I packed a perfectly balanced lunch for you.

01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:55.039
Just thinking about Tae Rin finally starting her project,

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.139
I'm so excited.

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:59.209
You think I can't get mad just because you're being nice?

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:00.519
I'm not like that.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.850
Gosh, it's snowing.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.760
Maybe watching the snow will cheer you up.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.090
Just for ten minutes.

01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:12.960
I'm not religious,

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.000
but who do you think makes it snow?

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.200
I'd just like to thank them.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.180
Gosh.

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:34.550
Hey, that looks great.

01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:40.320
One, two, three!

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:47.299
How did you finish the whole plate by yourself?

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:48.900
It's a single serving.

01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:52.300
It was gone in just a few bites.

01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:55.570
Is there anything you want to eat?

01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:59.040
If you see something you like, read it out.

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.010
Fish cake soup.

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.680
That's it?

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.150
I was hoping you'd be hungrier.

01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:19.189
"Assorted skewers, 12 dollars."

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:20.459
"Rolled omelet, 8 dollars."

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.199
"Additional charge for cheese."

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.700
"Pressed pork, chicken feet..."

01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:25.930
You just had chicken feet.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.440
Seriously, you're hilarious.

01:04:33.310 --> 01:04:35.110
Then why'd you make me read it?

01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:38.680
You're smiling.

01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:41.820
Looks like you're in a better mood.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:47.020
Since you're feeling better, you should pick something to eat.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.400
This has nothing to do with my mood.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:03.000
No matter what, I wanted to hold your hand today.

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:15.520
Are we ready for this?

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.990
- Of course not. - Then what's this?

01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:20.190
Cheers!

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.570
The snow's going to stick today.

01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:37.970
What if the roads get icy?

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.040
That's true.

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:53.120
Puff.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.760
I remember.

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.470
You used to do that just as hard before too...

01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:05.870
to make it heal faster.

01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:19.710
You have to blow like this.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:23.250
It's all in the breath, not your voice.

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.599
We're being so silly.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:42.800
What do you mean?

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.509
I'm not the silly one.

01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:47.010
That's usually what the silly ones say, you know.

01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:48.510
Whatever.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.789
I think I'm starting to get it now.

01:06:57.790 --> 01:06:58.820
What?

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.360
When you're too happy,

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.460
it can be scary, too.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.280
No matter when or where,

01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:27.080
or how we met,

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:30.450
I would never have turned back.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:37.630
I could never have...

01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:40.330
turned back these feelings.

01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:48.800
(My Youth)

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:51.470
What are we going to do?

01:08:52.530 --> 01:08:54.570
Going abroad is his best option.

01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:57.240
So you have to go far away to get better?

01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:59.940
Oh, no.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.080
Oh, no. Hae...

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.350
Even if it means I die, I want to stay here,

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:07.450
next to my loved ones.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.950
I don't want to part ways with Hae.

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:14.419
What if something goes wrong while he's there?

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.590
(To Sung Je Yeon)

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.660
Some moments will feel...

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:21.060
And maybe forever will feel...

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:23.330
like this very moment.

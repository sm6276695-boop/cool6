00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.280
{\an8}I'm making you
vice president of our company.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.600
{\an8}You mean it, Dad?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.880
{\an8}Keep your eyes on everyone
in the Chokprasertsap family.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.600
{\an8}That's your old family name, isn't it?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.560
{\an8}These are the names of the suspects
and several persons of interest.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.960
{\an8}And if what you're thinking
turns out to be true,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.480
{\an8}what will you do?

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.600
{\an8}Then it'll be to the death.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.640
{\an8}He can hurt me and I'll take it.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.440
{\an8}But when he hurts you,
the person I love most,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.960
{\an8}I can't forgive that.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.160
{\an8}Boss.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.680
Tawan.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.840
You're here early. Have you eaten yet?

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.080
Why come here and ruin the mood?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.560
Hey.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.000
- Hey!
- Tawan!

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.640
How dare you slap my son!

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.200
Then ask your son first

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.680
how he could do such an evil thing.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.880
What are you talking about?

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.120
Mr. Mekha, please come with us
to the station to give a statement.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.320
Hold on, officer.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.640
What has my son done
that you're taking him in?

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.800
Tawan, why did you call the police?

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.640
What lies are you feeding them about me?

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.400
Your subordinate,
Mr. Thawat, has confessed.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.280
He testified that you ordered him

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.720
to abduct Ms. Ayla, daughter of Mr. Thana,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.680
to force Mr. Thana
to withdraw from the bidding.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.760
And in the incident, one of Mr. Thana's
hired bodyguards was killed.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.560
But I didn't order that.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.160
Dad, you've got to believe me.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.840
Thawat acted on his own.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.640
I know nothing about it.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.760
I'm not involved in any of it!

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.840
Dad…

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.040
Mom… Please help me, Mom.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.400
Of course, I'll help you. Calm down.
They're framing you.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.880
That bitch is framing you!

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.520
You've got to help our son.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.600
Please come with us.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.080
Mom! Mom, help me!

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.960
I didn't do it, officer!

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.399
Let me go! I'm innocent!

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.640
- Mom! Mom!
- Mek!

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.200
- You have to help him!
- Mom!

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.519
- You have to!
- Let me go!

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.120
He didn't do anything wrong!

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.520
Don't just believe one side of the story.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.400
You have to help him!

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.640
Mek, my son! Mek!

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.560
Mek!

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.520
That girl… She's safe, isn't she?

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.360
Ayla's safe.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.320
Good…

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.880
That's good.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.360
Hey!

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.120
How could you just stand there
and do nothing?

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.920
How could you let them
drag our son away like that?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.400
The police have the evidence.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.600
Are you going to say our son's innocent?

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.480
Stop spoiling him the wrong way.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.320
Spoiling him?

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.680
You're saying I'm the one spoiling him?

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.240
You've never once

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.080
taken his side!

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.840
Everything Mek does,
to you, is wrong, bad, worthless.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.840
Nothing he does
is ever good enough for you.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.320
The only one who pleases you…

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.240
is that mistress's daughter. Everything
she does is perfect in your eyes!

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.080
That's why, isn't it?

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.440
That's why
you're letting our son rot in jail!

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.040
Listen to me. I've never played favorites.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.400
I love both my children the same.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.560
You're the one who hates Tawan.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.840
And you poisoned Mek into hating her too.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.080
In the end, they could never
live under the same roof.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.120
So, this is my fault?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.040
You destroyed their bond.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.000
The elder hates the younger.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.880
The younger rejects the elder.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.560
How fortunate

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.840
you haven't turned Mek against me as well.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.640
I'll tell you this.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.920
If Mek ends up in prison,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.040
both he and I will hate you
for the rest of our lives.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.480
Couldn't sleep?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.560
Because of your father?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.840
This is the first time

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.360
I've seen his tears.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.080
I understand.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.600
I don't know

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.520
how much this will break him.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.720
Mek's case

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.600
could shake the board of directors,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.000
destroy the company's credibility.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.800
If Dad can't fix this problem,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.159
then there might not be
a T.S. Construction anymore.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.520
Mr. Mek's case looks grim.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.880
The evidence is solid.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.320
Multiple money transfer slips
from him to the suspect,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.600
especially on the day of the abduction.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.000
The total is in the millions.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.440
Can we at least apply for bail?

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.320
It's going to be very difficult.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.720
Draft the termination papers
for the latest project.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.000
If we cancel,
the penalty fees will be enormous.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.920
No matter how much it costs, we'll pay.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.400
Boss,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.600
intel says T.S. Construction

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.920
has pulled out of their latest project.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.320
I think your father
must've thought it through

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.120
before deciding that.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.720
T.S. CONSTRUCTION SECRETARY

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.520
Hello?

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.760
Hello, Ms. Tawan.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.600
Hello.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.280
Let me get straight to the point.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.680
Ever since the incident with Mr. Mek,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.720
Mr. Songklod
hasn't been functioning at all.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.160
No partner meetings, no signing papers,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.280
no site visits.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.120
We don't know what to do anymore.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.560
Ms. Duangnet stepped in to handle things,

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.400
but honestly, it's only gotten worse.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.200
You had time to come see me today, huh?

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.240
What about you, Dad?

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.240
Not going in to work?

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.120
All I ever wanted
was to build this company

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.640
into the biggest in ASEAN,

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.840
for the future of both Mek and you.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.840
Sometimes I wonder…

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.920
All this ambition,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.440
all this fighting…

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.600
What's it really worth?

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.040
The wealth, the assets,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.840
traded for family,

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.360
for friendships lost.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.240
Was it worth it?

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.920
If I came to help at the company,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.240
would you teach me the ropes?

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.840
Don't waste your time on a company
that's already on the brink of collapse.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.280
I'd like you two

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.840
to design the third floor
so it goes with the rest of the building.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.880
Please help look into this.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.040
And you, please help
on the swimming pool design.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.240
Please help handle this.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.880
I'll help the company.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.280
This here is our latest quarter report.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.760
We're down 11.1%.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.520
As for the industry outlook…

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.680
We were just discussing
the latest VIP client, Boss.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.560
This project
is a 45-story residential tower.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.320
The current design is twin towers.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.520
If we can build new investor confidence,

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.560
we'll stand a chance
at winning government bids.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.120
That could restore
the company's liquidity.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.040
I agree.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.760
I agree as well.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.960
Yes?

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.280
Hello, Tawan.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.720
On your way home yet? I'm about to sleep.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.040
Not yet. Still working.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.240
What, still not done?

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.640
Have you even eaten?

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.000
I had a sandwich.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.760
Just trying to clear this backlog.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.040
Might be a late night.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.280
First day and already
working hard, Ms. CEO.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.280
What about you? How was your day?

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.760
Tired?

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.800
Not at all. At this level, it's a breeze.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.400
You're not upset with me, right?

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.680
For not picking you up?

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.080
Not at all. I understand

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.880
why you're doing this.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.560
I won't sulk. I'm grown up now.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.320
My girlfriend is the sweetest.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.640
Then I won't bother you anymore.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.200
Get back to work.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.440
Goodnight,

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.680
my love.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.280
Goodnight.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.720
Love you most.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.640
Mr. Thana, I sincerely apologize

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.280
for the awful things my brother did to you

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.120
and Ayla.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.960
The matter's now

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.720
in the hands of the law.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.079
And where's Songklod hiding?

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.240
Why are you apologizing for him?

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.800
Make him kneel before me!

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.520
What kind of man raises a son that vile?

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.079
I'm speaking on behalf
of my father and our family.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.680
But I assure you,

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.400
he had no knowledge

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.960
or involvement in what my brother did.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.000
And how can you be so sure

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.960
he wasn't involved?

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.160
If he had been,

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.400
he wouldn't have canceled
our latest project contract,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.920
costing the company tens of millions.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.080
He feels devastated by what happened.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.800
Even the company
he built with his own hands,

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.920
he was willing to let it collapse.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.720
What is it you really want from me?

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.800
I know I can't ask you

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.880
to forgive my father.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.320
But I stand by what I said before.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.080
I will take care of Ayla
and protect her for the rest of my life.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.480
I only hope
my sincerity and my life itself

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.000
might at least begin
to make amends for the failures

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.240
of the Chokprasertsap family.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.080
Songklod is lucky

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.120
to have you as his daughter.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.800
I'm so glad

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.360
that this time,
Dad has forgiven your father too.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.440
They must know each other well enough.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.600
So Mr. Thana believes
my father truly had no part in it.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.720
The two of them…

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.720
They were best friends once. Why fight?

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.880
And drag the children into it?

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.160
If it weren't for all this bad blood,

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.560
we might've met long ago.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.320
Oh!

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.920
You're right!

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.040
I could've met you back in grade school.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.280
What a shame.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.760
No. Kindergarten!

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.200
Kindergarten?

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.560
Or maybe in Mommy's womb.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.640
Well, even if we met late,
we still found each other.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.520
Then here's my promise.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.440
No matter when or where,

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.840
I'll keep finding you, in every lifetime.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.840
You'll never escape me.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.680
And I'll gladly let you find me.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.760
I'm afraid Mr. Mek's case is hopeless.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.080
Take the bags to the car.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.720
Congratulations.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.360
You got everything you wanted.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.040
The company,

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.840
your father, this house.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.520
By working instead of Dad,

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.480
I'm not taking advantage.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.320
And I'm not trying
to steal anything from anyone.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.360
I'm only doing

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.960
what any daughter should.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.320
You're doing it well.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.600
When Mek returns,

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.640
I'll hand everything back to him.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.120
Everything.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.320
You know me. I keep my word.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.640
This house

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.000
belongs to Father,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.480
to you,

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.480
to Mek.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.280
But not to me.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.840
Tawan.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.560
I brought some papers for you to sign.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.000
Papers?

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.200
Actually,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.320
Mr. Tos asked for your signature.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.200
I'm helping at the company now, Dad.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.120
Why?

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.200
Because I don't want to see
everything fall apart.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.200
Yesterday I met with Mr. Thana.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.080
He said

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.480
this time, he'll forgive you.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.160
And he asked me to tell you,

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.400
he hopes

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.640
you'll finally reflect

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.000
and learn something.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.120
That bastard!

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.480
Thank you, my child.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.720
Thank you so much.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.120
All this time…

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.560
I've been a terrible father.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.480
I never protected you,
never took care of you.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.600
I let you suffer alone.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.840
And because I didn't want you
fighting with Mek anymore,

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.800
I forced myself
to send you away to Hong Kong.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.760
At least there,
your aunt and uncle could keep you safe.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.160
Mui, I'm entrusting my daughter to you.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.160
I can't bear to see her
living like this anymore.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.960
Duangnet has gone too far.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.600
I never realized
how much Tawan was suffering.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.240
When will you send her?

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.400
Tomorrow.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.080
Please, take care of her.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.160
Tawan,

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.520
go live with Aunt Mui in Hong Kong, okay?

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.400
You know, Tawan,

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.960
you've always been my pride.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.240
Even when you refused to see me

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.400
during my visits,

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.520
I knew

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.240
how hard you were studying.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.720
I knew your dreams.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.640
It's in the past, Dad.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.880
Please don't say more.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.880
I'm sorry.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.200
Sorry

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.960
I never looked after you.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.120
Sorry I made you suffer.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.000
Please give me one more chance.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.280
Thank you, my child.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.040
Thank you so much.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.560
And your dad's not going
to kick me out of the house?

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.800
I'm right here.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.480
You don't have to be afraid of anything.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.800
Hello, Aa.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.240
I'm Ayla.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.480
I brought you lots of vitamins today.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.080
Not Aa.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.600
Call me Lung, like Uncle.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.160
I'm older than your father
by a few months.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.480
Thank you. Sit down.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.320
That day we first met… I'm sorry.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.120
I spoke harshly to you.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.680
It's okay.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.760
I understood the situation.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.600
And honestly, my dad

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.400
wasn't exactly gentle either.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.040
The truth is…

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.000
it was me who cheated your father.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.640
Back then, we started
a construction company together.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.520
We were best friends and partners.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.640
But I got greedy.
I wanted to get rich fast.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.480
So, I secretly set up my own company.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.680
And when I found out
how much Thana would bid,

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.440
I always undercut him to win.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.280
In the end, the company
we built together collapsed.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.200
And I pulled out my shares
before it happened,

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.760
leaving your father
to shoulder all the debts,

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.480
to pay off employees,

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.880
to pay the suppliers.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.760
I'm glad

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.920
you finally admitted the truth.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.320
The truth is the truth.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.720
And I also want to apologize for my son,

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.560
for the harm
he caused you and your father.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.520
I truly regret it.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.000
Please don't blame yourself.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.000
My father and I are safe now.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.040
And besides, Tawan takes good care of me.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.960
No wonder.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.320
That's why she loves you so much.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.760
You can't stop smiling.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.040
Of course.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.200
I've already secured my crown
as the family's future daughter-in-law.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.880
And you can be sure

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.800
I've never given that title

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.400
to anyone else.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.520
Let's get married then.

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:12.199
I want to marry you.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.000
Slow down, Ayla.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.920
That line is supposed to come from me.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.520
Oh please, whoever says it doesn't matter.
What matters is the result.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.760
So? Are we getting married or not?

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.960
We are.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.120
But Mr. Thana
won't storm our wedding, right?

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.840
Oh, you just ruined the mood.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.159
Let's hope

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:47.440
he softens his heart.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:52.440
Have hope!

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.040
Have hope, have hope… I'm manifesting it!

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.720
Have hope, have hope, have hope!

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.560
Hope or not,

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.320
I'll never

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.840
let go of the one

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.240
my heart chose.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.640
I love your treehouse, Tawan.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.600
So that means…

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.840
the only one left is your dearest dad.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.000
Honestly, it's not about Tawan.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.640
It's old grudges between our fathers.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.600
I don't know
when they'll forgive each other.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.160
Well, at least now there's a little light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.520
Just hoping that day comes soon.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.120
{\an8}BEC MUSIC FESTIVAL

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.400
And…

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.640
Where's Tawan been?

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.840
I haven't seen her lately.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.440
You miss her?

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.040
She's been busy,
working for both companies.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.760
We only get to talk
on the phone these days.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.880
I've signed off on several payments

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.560
for her bodyguard services.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.000
But accounting tells me

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.160
her company hasn't picked up the checks.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.080
Tell her to come get them.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.360
She won't take them.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.360
She says

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.280
protecting me is her duty
as a good girlfriend.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.880
When she can't be here herself,
she sends her staff.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.640
The whole team.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.680
I'm basically

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.360
VVVVIP Ayla!

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.000
If only she weren't Songklod's daughter,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.240
things would be so much easier.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.960
But can't her goodness

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.000
outweigh that or something?

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.480
Time will tell.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.520
Let's wait and see.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.600
Then get ready, Dad. You'll be seeing
a lot of her for a very, very long time.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.320
Because I'm not letting go.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.720
Tawan!

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.760
Wait, how did you get here?
You said you couldn't come!

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.360
Come here.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.960
Kie.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.040
- It's…
- Oh, okay.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.160
Actually, it'd be nice
if you could sit here and watch, clearly.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.080
You really want me to just sit and watch?

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.440
Don't you feel
it's a waste of my potential?

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.200
I'm a great bodyguard, you know.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.760
So what? I just want to sing for you.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.440
That's been my dream.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.880
If you sit here and listen to me sing,

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.480
and I'm singing right here…

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.280
But if you came up and sang with me,

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.720
that would make me so happy.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.200
Me? On stage? Singing?

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.280
Poor audience.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.360
Don't lie. I've heard you sing before.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.160
I was eavesdropping.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.200
You really are trouble.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.040
I'll stick to listening.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.200
Fine, fine.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.880
I won't force you up on stage.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.240
But can I ask just one thing?

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.360
Will you sit here
and watch over me while I'm singing?

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.960
Tomorrow I have a big meeting.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.360
A major project.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.360
I can't skip it.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.280
That's a shame.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.480
But I won't sulk.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.400
I'm sorry.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.960
No, don't be.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.000
You didn't do anything wrong.
Really, I understand.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.680
Just wish me luck. That's enough.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.520
My Ayla's amazing.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.920
You've got this.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.120
Piece of cake, right?

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.520
Is Tawan here yet?

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.080
Not yet.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.520
BACK STAGE STAFF ONLY

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.080
I just wish
You'd understand my heart for once

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:13.520
Every time I lock eyes with you
I'm hoping you'll hear my voice

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.320
Hear what it's saying deep inside

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:22.760
But you never seem to care at all

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.520
No matter how hard I try

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:31.680
Your heart stays closed
And all you do is look right past me

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:36.280
You better know, the one you're looking at
Won't just fall for your magic like that

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.960
You better know, I'm a superstar

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.280
If you wanna try
You'll have to wait in line

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.680
It's not that I'm stuck-up
I'm just not that easygoing

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.920
If you wanna shoot your shot
You'll have to pass my review

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.640
Only you

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:56.520
Don't mean to scare you…

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.200
See you later!

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:32.880
Encore! Encore!

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.160
Encore! Encore!

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.680
Ayla.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.040
{\an8}How could this happen?

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.520
{\an8}Ayla is still so young.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.440
{\an8}She won't be able to go back
to working the way she used to.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.360
{\an8}Please tell me the truth.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.000
{\an8}Is this your way of forcing me
to accept you,

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.880
{\an8}even as Songklod's daughter?

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.600
{\an8}Please just give me the chance
to see them one more time.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.480
{\an8}Are you sure you can handle this, Ayla?

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.160
{\an8}Ayla! Ayla!

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:56.840
{\an8}I don't know if this will be
the last time we meet.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.920

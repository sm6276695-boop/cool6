00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:12.164
I'm going to take off the pants, too.

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.757
You can be angry later.

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:21.431
I'd rather have you hate me for this
than let something happen to you.

00:00:27.864 --> 00:00:30.164
I hope you feel better soon.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.466
There's no way I could ever hate you.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.157
Not ever.

[Secret Love with Prince]­

00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:44.311
Brother?

00:01:54.157 --> 00:01:56.129
Azusa?

00:01:58.476 --> 00:02:02.639
You were happy with watching us
on TV anyway, right?

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:04.550
Why not just go back to doing that?

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.059
Goodbye.

00:02:19.274 --> 00:02:22.169
Sorry, I woke you up.

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:25.010
No.

00:02:26.708 --> 00:02:29.839
I think you're almost
back to normal body temperature.

00:02:46.216 --> 00:02:48.109
What's wrong?

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:51.203
Please don't go.

00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:54.363
I'm begging you.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.213
Please don't go anywhere.

00:03:00.741 --> 00:03:04.542
Don't hate me.

00:03:07.923 --> 00:03:10.662
There's no way I would hate you.

00:03:11.242 --> 00:03:13.309
I love you a lot.

00:03:15.304 --> 00:03:17.927
- But you...
- Sorry.

00:03:18.684 --> 00:03:20.535
I...

00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:25.567
I don't like myself when I'm your boyfriend.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.553
- Huh?
- I'm insecure, I get jealous easily,

00:03:30.553 --> 00:03:34.500
I lose my cool all the time,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.890
and I really want to keep you for myself.

00:03:41.845 --> 00:03:47.375
Until the award show,
I can't have my focus shift off work.

00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:52.512
That's why I said
to go back to being just siblings.

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:56.755
I'm sorry.

00:03:59.282 --> 00:04:01.608
Please don't say sorry.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:05.220
Right now, I'm too stressed out,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.050
and I know things are a bit weird.

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.959
But I want to do my best.

00:04:21.348 --> 00:04:27.164
I'll definitely show you
that I'm the coolest prince in the world.

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:33.511
I will always be number one.

00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:42.420
So...

00:04:44.257 --> 00:04:47.576
watch me up close.

00:04:57.968 --> 00:05:01.865
Is it okay if I kiss you?

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.826
No.

00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:08.322
- Why not?
- I mean, definitely not right now.

00:05:08.322 --> 00:05:10.395
- Why?
- When I say no, it means no.

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:12.476
- Why not?
- Geez!

00:05:12.476 --> 00:05:15.502
I'm trying hard not to make a move!

00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:19.280
I told you, once I'm off the stage,

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.480
I'm just a regular high school guy.

00:05:25.686 --> 00:05:29.160
Yeah. Me too. When it's just the two of us,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.320
I want you to be your usual self.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.496
Then, just in these moments,

00:05:39.096 --> 00:05:44.797
can I have the famous Prince Azusa
all to myself?

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.255
You just said no kissing!

00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:05.699
Can you say it again about what you just said?

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.623
I want to hear it when you're feeling better.

00:06:10.532 --> 00:06:15.899
When that time comes, let's continue this kiss. Okay?

00:06:19.115 --> 00:06:20.959
Okay.

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.819
Please enjoy the food.

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.211
Thank you.

00:06:24.211 --> 00:06:27.361
- Thank you.
- You just told me not to leave out tomatoes.

00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:28.707
I can't handle tomatoes.

00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:32.726
If that's the case, you're not qualified
to eat Matsuri's food. Spit it out!

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.369
- Seconds, please.
- Oh, me too!

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:37.020
- Don't make me shove it in your mouth!
- Don't eat too much, okay?

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.176
Especially Kei, you're prone to gaining weight.

00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:41.248
Me? Why am I getting caught in crossfire?

00:06:41.248 --> 00:06:43.298
Let's all try to eat quietly.

00:06:43.298 --> 00:06:45.072
Agreed.

00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:48.425
Oh? We agree for once.

00:06:49.373 --> 00:06:53.038
- It's delicious, Matsuri.
- I'm glad you like our home cooking.

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:55.538
It's really delicious.

00:06:55.538 --> 00:06:57.859
Whoa, geez! What the heck is this?

00:06:57.859 --> 00:07:00.828
- Make sure you eat it.
- What?

00:07:07.715 --> 00:07:10.177
Subaru, is the article true?

00:07:10.177 --> 00:07:12.019
- Is it true?
- Please say something.

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:14.274
Oh? That's your partner.

00:07:14.274 --> 00:07:16.417
- What?
- Is it true that you cast your lover

00:07:16.417 --> 00:07:18.760
in your debut music video's leading role?

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.441
Okay. There will be no comments at the moment.
Please calm down for a moment.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.742
Please do not take photos.

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:25.262
[Subaru cast his lover
in his debut music video's leading role]

00:07:25.262 --> 00:07:27.310
No, that's not right.

00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:29.872
It's not what they all think.

00:07:29.872 --> 00:07:32.592
They've totally twisted the truth.

00:07:32.592 --> 00:07:37.622
First of all, I'm the one
who recommended her for the music video.

00:07:37.622 --> 00:07:39.830
The truth doesn't matter.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.443
The article is out.

00:07:41.443 --> 00:07:44.424
It's what they do.
Bring someone riding high down to the ground.

00:07:44.424 --> 00:07:45.955
It's a common tactic.

00:07:45.955 --> 00:07:48.515
Let's discuss this in the office.

00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:50.495
The training camp is canceled.

00:07:50.495 --> 00:07:52.637
Don't leave the house.

00:07:56.051 --> 00:08:00.852
We aren't even that close.

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:09.449
Matsuri.

00:08:10.564 --> 00:08:14.775
Don't worry, everything's fine.

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:26.406
No.
[Isn't that how male idols are?]

00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:29.036
He's not like that.
[Spending money on them is a waste.]

00:08:29.036 --> 00:08:31.415
He's not like that at all.

00:08:35.173 --> 00:08:38.930
You seem preoccupied with Subaru.

00:08:39.972 --> 00:08:42.043
Sorry.

00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:45.444
I understand you're worried and anxious.

00:08:45.444 --> 00:08:47.427
Just take some rest.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.391
It's okay.

00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:53.765
Subaru is the one having a hard time.

00:08:53.765 --> 00:08:59.169
Even so, it's my job to worry about you.

00:08:59.169 --> 00:09:01.668
Listen to what I'm saying.

00:09:01.668 --> 00:09:04.793
It's okay to worry about Subaru.

00:09:07.068 --> 00:09:09.038
Thank you.

00:09:10.994 --> 00:09:14.021
Actually, I don't really like it.

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:16.783
It's so complicated.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.082
Sorry.

00:09:20.082 --> 00:09:26.378
But, Azusa, isn't there anything we can do?

00:09:26.378 --> 00:09:28.088
Like what?

00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:30.397
I don't know.

00:09:31.096 --> 00:09:35.281
- Maybe I should talk to the weekly magazine.
- That's impossible.

00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:37.929
But maybe they'll publish the article.

00:09:37.929 --> 00:09:41.745
- That's not a good idea.
- But Subaru's name is entangled.

00:09:41.745 --> 00:09:46.976
- This is the kind of job we're doing.
- That's not how it should be!

00:09:53.891 --> 00:09:55.953
Tell me one thing, Matsuri.

00:09:56.803 --> 00:09:59.097
Me from Terzetto...

00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:02.660
and Subaru from Prism.

00:10:04.328 --> 00:10:06.308
Who do you like?

00:10:08.271 --> 00:10:10.873
What are you talking about?

00:10:11.463 --> 00:10:17.267
- Of course, it's you.
- Then, if it were between me...

00:10:18.169 --> 00:10:21.586
and Subaru that you loved long ago?

00:10:30.401 --> 00:10:34.093
Isn't it true that you feel most secure
with Subaru?

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.250
Isn't it Subaru who makes you feel at ease?

00:10:39.489 --> 00:10:42.889
Maybe you didn't realize it
because he was always too close.

00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:45.830
But hasn't it always been Subaru...

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.310
who has always had feelings for you?

00:10:53.895 --> 00:10:55.607
Matsuri.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.673
I'm sorry.

00:11:23.985 --> 00:11:26.115
Yamato.

00:11:26.115 --> 00:11:29.346
What are you doing, little sis?

00:11:29.346 --> 00:11:31.681
Where's Subaru?

00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:33.337
He's talking with the boss.

00:11:33.337 --> 00:11:35.300
Looks like it's going to take a while.

00:11:36.023 --> 00:11:38.719
Then I'll wait outside.

00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:40.504
It's cold.

00:11:40.504 --> 00:11:42.445
It's okay.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.911
You shouldn't. The media is here, too.

00:11:48.911 --> 00:11:51.096
I'm saying this because I'm worried, you know.

00:11:51.096 --> 00:11:52.912
Do you understand?

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:55.162
You're too close.

00:11:55.834 --> 00:11:58.599
Didn't we already kiss once?

00:11:59.187 --> 00:12:01.356
You guys kissed?

00:12:02.586 --> 00:12:04.942
Oh, it's nothing.

00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:09.210
Didn't you say you recommended her
for the music video?

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.224
Could it be, in fact,

00:12:11.224 --> 00:12:13.846
it wasn't Subaru, but you two who were together...

00:12:13.846 --> 00:12:15.408
That's not it!

00:12:15.408 --> 00:12:17.448
Yamato isn't like that.

00:12:17.448 --> 00:12:20.506
There's no deeper meaning at all.

00:12:32.971 --> 00:12:34.505
Matsuri.

00:12:36.774 --> 00:12:38.079
Why're you...

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:39.207
You're getting wet.

00:12:39.207 --> 00:12:42.360
Subaru, I'm going to the magazine

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.280
to explain that it's a misunderstanding.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.779
Don't do it. There's no need.

00:12:47.482 --> 00:12:49.915
Don't get involved unnecessarily.

00:12:49.915 --> 00:12:51.695
It's troublesome.

00:12:57.253 --> 00:13:00.090
I don't want to drag you into this.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.765
You idiot.

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:08.298
But as your childhood friend,
I can prove it. Right?

00:13:08.298 --> 00:13:14.095
Subaru has always been kind, and everyone's hero.

00:13:14.988 --> 00:13:20.902
Subaru, the truth is that you're not good
at coddling or being vulnerable.

00:13:22.263 --> 00:13:26.225
Please, let me help.

00:13:40.758 --> 00:13:42.717
I love you.

00:13:44.928 --> 00:13:47.311
Don't go to the publisher.

00:13:47.311 --> 00:13:49.154
It's okay.

00:13:49.154 --> 00:13:52.170
I'm going to take back all that was taken away.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.877
My position, honor, and you.

00:14:00.021 --> 00:14:02.980
I'm not the unreliable person I used to be.

00:14:03.662 --> 00:14:05.786
Don't underestimate me.

00:14:05.786 --> 00:14:09.974
I'm an idol, the ace of Prism.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.790
You're back.

00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:35.427
Come on, let's wash your feet.

00:14:41.227 --> 00:14:43.010
I'm sorry.

00:14:46.487 --> 00:14:48.833
Sorry for what?

00:14:50.175 --> 00:14:52.279
What do you mean?

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:03.353
You shook off my hand
and ran to Subaru instead?

00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:10.227
Or is there something else
you want me to feel guilty about?

00:15:24.088 --> 00:15:26.760
I'm really sorry,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.170
for running out when you were worried about me.

00:15:31.293 --> 00:15:36.813
I was going to tell Subaru that I was
planning on going to the magazine company.

00:15:36.813 --> 00:15:41.274
But Subaru stopped me.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:43.233
So...

00:15:44.645 --> 00:15:47.496
Did he make a move on you?

00:15:50.352 --> 00:15:52.168
What?

00:15:52.168 --> 00:15:54.305
Of course he did.

00:15:54.836 --> 00:15:57.350
When you're going through a tough time,

00:15:58.033 --> 00:16:02.020
when someone you love dearly
thinks about you all the time,

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.410
and worries about you,

00:16:05.258 --> 00:16:10.805
it's naturally endearing.

00:16:13.344 --> 00:16:16.334
It's hard to hold back your emotions.

00:16:44.016 --> 00:16:46.223
From this moment...

00:16:47.808 --> 00:16:50.102
be mine.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.749
It hurts.

00:17:24.995 --> 00:17:27.370
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:31.732
You just took me by surprise.

00:17:33.853 --> 00:17:35.655
I'm sorry.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.408
Only Subaru is being suspended.

00:17:47.408 --> 00:17:50.020
Why isn't Yamato here?

00:17:53.032 --> 00:17:55.836
I wonder if he got the time wrong.

00:17:56.342 --> 00:17:58.808
He hasn't read the message yet.

00:18:02.942 --> 00:18:05.495
Did you hear that the commercial was canceled, too?

00:18:07.082 --> 00:18:10.389
Yeah, they don't know
how much penalty we have to pay.

00:18:11.361 --> 00:18:15.298
Starting off like this after our debut
is just a disaster.

00:18:15.298 --> 00:18:17.857
Don't say that.

00:18:17.857 --> 00:18:20.382
There's still something we can do.

00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:28.041
What? Why's he here?

00:18:28.041 --> 00:18:29.843
So handsome!

00:18:30.769 --> 00:18:32.392
Hey.

00:18:32.392 --> 00:18:34.740
Can we talk outside for a bit?

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.069
- What?
- The uniform is not suitable.

00:18:37.069 --> 00:18:38.750
Go home and change first.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.415
I'll come to pick you up.

00:18:41.107 --> 00:18:42.846
What?

00:18:49.066 --> 00:18:51.711
Kei, why are you here?

00:18:51.711 --> 00:18:54.474
I heard Yamato was slacking off here.

00:18:54.474 --> 00:18:56.876
Can you say something smart to convince him?

00:18:56.876 --> 00:19:00.280
- Me?
- Help out a little.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.549
Please do this. I'll go look for Yamato.

00:19:09.592 --> 00:19:11.006
You alone?

00:19:11.006 --> 00:19:13.594
No, I'm waiting for someone.

00:19:13.594 --> 00:19:15.343
You're super cute.

00:19:15.343 --> 00:19:16.971
Let's have a drink together.

00:19:16.971 --> 00:19:20.210
Ah... I...

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:25.475
Well then, if you drink this in one go,
I'll let you go.

00:19:25.475 --> 00:19:26.864
Let me go!

00:19:26.864 --> 00:19:29.865
- Bist du schüchtern?
- Hey, Mann.

00:19:29.865 --> 00:19:32.809
Kannst du aufhören, meinen Freund zu ärgern?

00:19:33.618 --> 00:19:35.548
Komm, lass uns gehen.

00:19:38.528 --> 00:19:42.328
Kei, warum hast du sie mitgebracht?

00:19:42.328 --> 00:19:44.245
Ohne Köder würden Sie weglaufen.

00:19:44.245 --> 00:19:46.687
Warum schwänzen Sie den Unterricht?

00:19:47.468 --> 00:19:50.856
Der Unterricht ist jetzt bedeutungslos.

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:53.426
Egal, was wir tun, Prism ist vorbei.

00:19:53.426 --> 00:19:55.900
Ein Skandal in dieser Zeit bedeutet für uns das Ende.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.006
Yamato, das stimmt nicht.

00:20:02.762 --> 00:20:05.677
Ich habe eine Mitfahrgelegenheit bestellt,
also kümmern Sie sich bitte bis dahin darum.

00:20:05.677 --> 00:20:07.735
Hä?

00:20:07.735 --> 00:20:10.521
Yamato, komm zurück.

00:20:10.521 --> 00:20:12.432
Prism ist noch nicht vorbei.

00:20:12.432 --> 00:20:15.857
Sie und Subaru auch nicht.

00:20:23.129 --> 00:20:25.773
Du hast ihn gehört. Die Fahrt kommt.

00:20:25.773 --> 00:20:28.003
Warten Sie vor der Bar.

00:20:28.003 --> 00:20:30.406
Ich bringe dich dorthin.

00:20:31.011 --> 00:20:34.464
Hey, komm mit uns nach Hause.

00:20:35.266 --> 00:20:38.290
Im Moment machst du dir Sorgen um Subaru,

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.420
und die für Sie wichtigste ist Azusa, richtig?

00:20:40.423 --> 00:20:43.437
Lass mich einfach in Ruhe.

00:20:43.437 --> 00:20:45.887
Ich kann dich unmöglich allein lassen.

00:20:45.887 --> 00:20:49.377
Ich weiß, wie ernst Ihnen Prism
und Ihr Idoldasein sind.

00:20:49.377 --> 00:20:51.561
Du meinst es unglaublich ernst, ich weiß!

00:20:51.561 --> 00:20:54.530
- Deshalb...
- bin ich deprimiert!

00:20:58.538 --> 00:21:01.512
Weil du mich nicht ausgewählt hast.

00:21:03.145 --> 00:21:04.711
Hä?

00:21:08.224 --> 00:21:10.616
Ich fühle mich wie ein Idiot.

00:21:11.218 --> 00:21:13.815
Das wollte ich nie sagen.

00:21:15.595 --> 00:21:20.513
Ich hasse es wirklich, wenn andere mich aus dem Takt bringen.

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:28.543
Aber wenn du dabei bist,
werde ich die ganze Zeit einfach nur albern.

00:21:29.326 --> 00:21:32.180
Sogar jetzt bin ich wirklich besorgt.

00:21:32.811 --> 00:21:37.459
Ich habe Angst davor, was passieren wird, wenn Prism vorbei ist.

00:21:42.576 --> 00:21:45.005
Ich hasse es.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.122
Prism ist für mich wie eine Familie.

00:21:49.739 --> 00:21:53.079
Nicht nur Subaru leidet.

00:21:55.266 --> 00:21:57.822
Schau mich doch einmal an!

00:22:00.458 --> 00:22:02.305
Yamato.

00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:06.595
Wahrscheinlich viel mehr, als ich zugeben möchte …

00:22:08.841 --> 00:22:10.951
Ich mag dich.

00:22:12.132 --> 00:22:13.695
Was?

00:22:16.408 --> 00:22:22.301
Ich will dich
und bin verzweifelter als sonst.

00:22:23.189 --> 00:22:26.322
Hallo, entschuldigen Sie die Unterbrechung.

00:22:26.322 --> 00:22:28.497
Wir filmen, lächeln Sie für die Kamera!

00:22:28.497 --> 00:22:29.692
Hey!

00:22:29.692 --> 00:22:32.396
Ah. Ich dachte, ich hätte dich erkannt.
Du bist Prisms Yamato.

00:22:32.396 --> 00:22:35.772
Sie sehen ganz anders aus
, als Sie im Fernsehen aussehen.

00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:37.672
- Hey!
- Nee, du kommst nicht an sie heran.

00:22:37.672 --> 00:22:41.579
Ich werde Ihren Schwarm auf die gleiche Weise in Verlegenheit bringen
und es in den sozialen Medien viral machen.

00:22:41.579 --> 00:22:43.177
Wenn es Ihnen nicht gefällt, können Sie wütend werden.

00:22:43.177 --> 00:22:46.519
Sagen Sie, dass die Idol-Persönlichkeit eine reine Lüge war.

00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:50.029
Andernfalls schütte ich das ganze Getränk über sie.

00:22:52.122 --> 00:22:58.429
Du weißt nichts,
also steh mir nicht im Weg!

00:23:01.232 --> 00:23:06.254
Was ist falsch daran, wenn ein Idol
versucht, bei seinen Fans ein bestimmtes Image aufrechtzuerhalten?

00:23:06.254 --> 00:23:12.255
Es ist überhaupt nicht einfach, die Fassung zu behalten, ohne die Leute zu enttäuschen .

00:23:13.078 --> 00:23:18.455
Zumindest gibt er sich große Mühe
, für seine Fans das Idealbild zu sein.

00:23:18.455 --> 00:23:20.825
Die Leute erzählen immer wieder Wahrheiten und Lügen,

00:23:20.825 --> 00:23:22.936
aber jeder versucht verzweifelt,
ein Lächeln auf seinem Gesicht zu behalten.

00:23:22.936 --> 00:23:24.347
Wie kann man das nicht verstehen?

00:23:24.347 --> 00:23:27.392
Hör auf, Scheiße zu reden, du Göre!

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.963
Das war knapp.

00:23:38.187 --> 00:23:39.986
Bist du verletzt?

00:23:40.767 --> 00:23:42.657
Azusa?

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:50.640
[Dieses Drama ist Fiktion.]

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.134
Keine Aufführung des Terzetts.
[Terzetto in einer echten Zwickmühle?]

00:23:52.134 --> 00:23:53.368
Ich entschuldige mich.
[Bereit, wegen einer Verletzung aufzugeben]

00:23:53.368 --> 00:23:54.332
Ich zeige es dir.

00:23:54.332 --> 00:23:56.801
Sind Sie wirklich zufrieden mit
[Prism – eine schicksalshafte Live-Performance!]

00:23:56.801 --> 00:23:58.103
die freundliche und ideale Version von uns?
[Mögen alle Gefühle durchkommen!]

00:23:58.103 --> 00:24:00.341
Willst du danach bei mir abhängen?
[Die turbulente Schlussfolge]

00:24:00.341 --> 00:24:01.687
Ich werde es beweisen.
[Was ist das Schicksal der Liebe zwischen Azusa und Matsuri?]

00:24:01.687 --> 00:24:04.890
Dein Platz ist direkt an meiner Seite.
[Was ist das Schicksal der Liebe von Azusa und Matsuri?]

00:00:13.053 --> 00:00:18.297
The doctor says there will be pain for a while,
but it should be fine if you rest.

00:00:18.297 --> 00:00:20.448
I'm so relieved it wasn't worse.

00:00:20.448 --> 00:00:23.154
I'm also glad you're safe, Matsuri.

00:00:23.154 --> 00:00:28.230
Yamato carried him here,
that's how we could treat him right away.

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:33.415
I can do it.

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.737
I will definitely participate in the competition.

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:41.598
No, you're not going to do it.

00:00:41.598 --> 00:00:42.930
What?

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:48.289
Prism will probably have to cover two slots.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.038
They're dealing with the issues right now.

00:00:51.038 --> 00:00:52.502
No way.

00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:56.375
No matter what, I'll go,
and win the Luminous Prize Award.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:58.240
Don't be ridiculous.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.229
You can't stand on a stage like that.

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:08.767
Just step down with dignity.

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:11.630
Don't show your fans your weak side.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:26.579
Once on stage,
I'll be the cool and perfect version of myself.

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:29.999
That's who I am as an idol.

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:32.833
Stay quiet like Yamato said.

00:01:34.182 --> 00:01:36.605
Terzetto won't be performing.

00:02:25.113 --> 00:02:27.112
I'll put it here.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.417
I'll get going.

00:02:33.763 --> 00:02:35.903
Are you leaving already?

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:44.827
I don't want to be with you anymore.

00:02:45.737 --> 00:02:47.066
What?

00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:54.893
I've done nothing but cause trouble,
and ended up getting you hurt like this.

00:02:57.547 --> 00:02:59.976
I don't have the confidence to stay by your side.

00:03:02.743 --> 00:03:06.072
Are you worried about that now?

00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:09.628
Huh?

00:03:10.568 --> 00:03:14.487
If that's the case,
I've been causing trouble all the time too.

00:03:17.057 --> 00:03:19.708
I'm not of much help at all.

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:23.283
I try to help but end up getting hurt.

00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:27.865
- Don't say that.
- It's better that you see me on TV.

00:03:27.865 --> 00:03:30.425
At least you get to witness
only the cool side of me that way.

00:03:39.374 --> 00:03:46.237
But, I'm tired of just
being admired from afar.

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:55.535
If you don't trust me,
I'll go on stage and prove it myself.

00:03:57.052 --> 00:04:01.400
Your place is right by my side.

00:04:03.987 --> 00:04:06.870
- But your injury...
- Matsuri.

00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:11.044
Believe in us.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.832
We're entering the awards.

00:04:14.832 --> 00:04:19.941
We'll give the best performance and win the award.

00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:32.957
Hey, Matsuri.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:40.335
I want to hear you say,
"I want to be by your side."

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.430
I wish you all the luck.

00:04:51.316 --> 00:04:52.590
Yeah.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.881
It's impossible.

00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:02.616
- Please.
- Please.

00:05:02.616 --> 00:05:06.654
The person currently hospitalized definitely
can't be on stage the day after tomorrow.

00:05:06.654 --> 00:05:09.516
Please, Azusa will be ready with determination.

00:05:09.516 --> 00:05:11.569
This is no amateur's game.

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.768
Prism will fill in for Terzetto. It's decided.

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:20.065
We, too, support Terzetto.

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:23.418
You guys don't need to.
Focus on your lessons.

00:05:23.418 --> 00:05:24.649
This is your opportunity.

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:27.299
Terzetto is an important rival for us.

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:28.971
We want to compete fairly.

00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:31.588
You're not in a position to show off.

00:05:31.588 --> 00:05:39.898
You once had a classy and perfect prince image,
but are now seen as a selfish and egotistical man.

00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:44.612
Even you guys are not in a great position.

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.385
Please.

00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:52.723
Hey.

00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:57.656
We will never shatter our fans' dreams.

00:05:58.474 --> 00:06:04.237
I will also
never do anything to disappoint anyone.

00:06:04.237 --> 00:06:09.018
Please give us two teams the go-ahead.

00:06:09.018 --> 00:06:13.534
And let us grab the title of Japan's top idol.

00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:16.447
Please.

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:32.879
Can we make it on time
for the changes in formation?

00:06:33.506 --> 00:06:35.179
Of course.

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:36.759
We're brothers.

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:38.636
We can handle anything.

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:51.243
Shall we do this too?

00:06:52.289 --> 00:07:00.440
Like noble princes, let's transform into
self-centered and egoistic men.

00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:03.356
Thank you.

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:06.425
Isn't it obvious?
We're teammates, after all.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.137
We may not be brothers,
but we're in this destiny together.

00:07:13.002 --> 00:07:14.055
Right?

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.655
Let's do it then.

00:08:26.191 --> 00:08:28.258
You're okay.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.631
You can do it.

Come in.

Oh, Matsuri. You came.

00:08:47.305 --> 00:08:52.947
Prism may be rivals with Terzetto,
but I'm very thankful to you guys,

00:08:52.947 --> 00:08:54.875
so here's a little something for you.

00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:56.333
Thank you.

00:08:57.688 --> 00:09:03.000
Also, I have something for you.

Huh?

It's a charm.

00:09:06.865 --> 00:09:14.390
I'm sure everyone will eventually see you for the
kindest and most sensitive person that you are.

Forget about those silly articles.

It's going to be okay.

00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:27.429
Seeing you so concerned,
maybe it's not so bad that the article got out.

00:09:27.429 --> 00:09:29.808
What are you talking about? Huh?

00:09:32.856 --> 00:09:40.222
Matsuri, once today's show is over,
will you be mine?

Please, be mine.

00:09:50.469 --> 00:09:53.108
You don't seem like the Subaru I know.

That's right, I'm selfish, self-centered,
and egotistical.

That's right...

it's time for the king to shine.

Well then, look forward to the show, Matsuri.

No.

See you.

I'm sorry.

Did it hurt?

Hey! You're unbelievable!

What do I do about this tooth mark?

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.741
- Call it a ring.
- It's a tooth mark!

- Yes, I'm going to eat all four!

- Stop talking nonsense.
- I could even eat six.

00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:53.873
- I'll eat them all.
- I'll have three.

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:56.696
- Hand them over.
- You're having three? That's too much.

00:12:56.696 --> 00:12:58.757
I'll eat them.

00:13:01.273 --> 00:13:05.011

watch over me from the side of the stage.

When we're done, make sure to give me a reward.

00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:03.450
Hello, we are Terzetto.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.570
Are you guys ready?

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.978
Let's hear some noise!

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.933
I love you, princess.

00:19:31.175 --> 00:19:34.437
It's like watching a totally new Terzetto.

00:19:34.437 --> 00:19:35.872
What?

00:19:57.318 --> 00:20:00.074
Aw, damn it!

00:20:10.045 --> 00:20:11.379
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

00:20:11.379 --> 00:20:12.657
Thank you, lovely people.

00:20:12.657 --> 00:20:14.405
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

00:20:14.405 --> 00:20:16.139
- Great job!
- Thanks.

00:20:16.139 --> 00:20:18.473
- Nice work.
- You too.

00:20:18.473 --> 00:20:22.489
Azusa, you are the coolest in the world.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.441
Hurry up and give me my reward.

00:20:28.441 --> 00:20:29.609
What?

00:20:31.206 --> 00:20:33.288
Shall we spend this moment alone together?

00:20:38.733 --> 00:20:43.088
You know, I realized something on today's stage.

00:20:44.318 --> 00:20:47.906
I absolutely want to be by your side.

00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:52.798
No matter how pathetic I feel...

00:20:54.511 --> 00:20:58.206
I don't want to run away
from my feelings for you anymore.

00:20:58.206 --> 00:21:00.258
I'm done running away.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.008
I won't let that happen.

00:21:05.008 --> 00:21:09.880
You'll be so crazy about us that you'll
forget about escaping for the rest of your life.

00:21:16.529 --> 00:21:18.088
Matsuri.

00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:23.271
You know, I truly love being an idol.

00:21:24.619 --> 00:21:25.866
I know.

00:21:26.574 --> 00:21:29.786
I'll definitely become a top idol.

00:21:29.786 --> 00:21:31.082
I know.

00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:38.978
But just as much as that, I love you.

00:21:41.504 --> 00:21:43.271
Even if you search the whole world,

00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:47.562
there's no one else who can make you feel in love
as much as I can.

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:52.971
I promise to cherish you with all my heart.

00:21:57.393 --> 00:21:58.747
Okay.

00:22:09.338 --> 00:22:12.614
Where are you? It's time for the after-party!

00:22:12.614 --> 00:22:15.142
- Hey, Haruka.
- You guys are together?

00:22:15.142 --> 00:22:18.290
- Matsuri!
- Oh, hey, Matsuri!

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.604
I'm the best brother, remember!

00:22:20.604 --> 00:22:23.024
Hey, Azusa, don't you dare lay a finger on her.

00:22:23.024 --> 00:22:25.299
Matsuri, let's go home right now
and take a bath together.

00:22:25.299 --> 00:22:26.931
You idiot.

00:22:26.931 --> 00:22:29.042
Matsuri, do you want to cuddle me
like a pillow tonight?

00:22:29.042 --> 00:22:30.271
Hey, say something!

00:22:30.271 --> 00:22:31.386
Hey, hey.

00:22:31.386 --> 00:22:33.442
- No, no, I have nothing to say.
- Of course you have something to say.

00:22:33.442 --> 00:22:35.288
Alright Matsuri, let's get married!

00:22:35.288 --> 00:22:37.428
Don't you dare say that, you sparkling prince!

00:22:37.428 --> 00:22:39.643
- I will never give my sister away!
- Just let me say it.

00:22:39.643 --> 00:22:42.142
Hey, little sister.

00:22:42.142 --> 00:22:43.611
What's with that blushing?

00:22:43.611 --> 00:22:45.415
Matsuri, come back.

00:22:45.415 --> 00:22:47.132
- Don't propose.
- Okay everyone.

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:49.474
What's so special about her anyway?

00:22:49.474 --> 00:22:51.838
- What?
- We're the top idols,

00:22:51.838 --> 00:22:54.944
- girls are going to be lining up for us.
- You know, no one can match her.

00:22:54.944 --> 00:22:58.592
Matsuri is the most precious sister to us. Right?

00:22:58.592 --> 00:22:59.862
I'm not her brother!

00:22:59.862 --> 00:23:02.944
Matsuri, it's your old pal Subaru... Huh?

00:23:02.944 --> 00:23:04.984
- What's wrong?
- Haruka, there's a problem with the screen.

00:23:04.984 --> 00:23:06.446
What's going on?

00:23:06.446 --> 00:23:09.296
The screen's all black! Hey, Azusa!

00:23:09.296 --> 00:23:11.313
- Matsuri?
- If something happens to Matsuri, I'll kill you!

00:23:11.313 --> 00:23:13.982
- Matsuri, are you okay?
- Matsuri?

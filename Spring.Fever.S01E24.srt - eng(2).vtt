00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.680
Shi'an.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.480
Shi'an. Shi'an.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.280
You... Don't scare me.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.680
I've loved A'man since childhood.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.840
I promised to protect her all my life.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.160
But my cowardice

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.320
keeps causing her more pain.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.320
This time,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.200
things will change.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.240
You sentimental coward!

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.880
I...

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.320
I am a coward.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.320
When I learned you killed Father

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.320
and watched Mother kneel before me,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.680
I tried to avenge them.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.320
But I couldn't.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.280
Because in this world,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.400
apart from them,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.360
you loved me most.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.840
Yet I don't understand.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.520
Since you loved me most,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.040
why couldn't you spare

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.240
my parents?

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.560
Shi'an. Shi'an. Shi'an.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.000
Your father was exhausted and terrified.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.920
He took his own life.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.400
My child,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.800
when you reach my age

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.800
and become family head,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.480
you'll realize that many things
are beyond your control,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.720
and many choices
aren't really yours to make.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.920
Shi'an, do you know that?

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.200
When you grew this tall,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.800
calling me "Grandmother" in your arms,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.640
I regretted everything.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.040
But it was too late.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.640
I spoiled you,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.040
trying to compensate through you.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.200
I knew

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.200
you weren't cut out
to be the family head.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.600
But I couldn't harden my heart

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.800
like your father.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.640
Sometimes, when I saw your face,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.880
I saw myself,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.760
your grandfather,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.520
and that foolish father of yours.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.400
Then I thought,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.280
your existence alone

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.280
would make my entire life

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.520
meaningful.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.240
Grandmother,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.160
I'm not threatening you.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.120
I truly

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.960
want to end my life.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.320
No.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.240
Not just for A'man.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.600
I hate you,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.600
but I can't kill you.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.400
So I have to kill myself instead.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.840
I'll let you experience

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.640
losing your dearest kin, like I did.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.800
I'll let you feel your beloved grandson

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.720
die before your eyes.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.200
Shi'an. Shi'an.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.320
My child.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.960
Grandmother,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.360
you can't

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.160
kill A'man after I'm gone.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.400
I've left a suicide note.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.920
If she dies or disappears,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.480
someone will give it to Shen Que

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.080
and deliver it to the capital.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.760
The whole world will know

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.280
you murdered your own grandson.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.760
Why are you doing this?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.160
From now on,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.600
in this world,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.200
you'll only have Jin left.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.120
I... I beg you.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.600
Don't

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.280
kill her mother

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.720
too.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.720
I promise.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.520
I... Someone!

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.520
Shi'an!

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.600
My Shi'an!

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.320
Shi'an!

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.440
Shi'an!

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.640
Say something.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.920
Shi'an.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.880
Shi'an.

I idly tap the Go stones,
as the lamp wick sheds sparks.

He will.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.280
I trust him.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.680
Yes. I used to trust too.

What?

My Lord.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.000
- Where are you going?
- Don't follow me.

Madam, he is stable for now.

But if he doesn't wake in two days,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.360
I'm afraid...

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.800
I only treat illnesses.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.600
Madam,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.600
please find an expert in antidotes soon.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.080
Okay.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.560
He became like this for you.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.400
If you care at all,

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.160

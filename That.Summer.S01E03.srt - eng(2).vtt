00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.650
I won't put up with you anymore.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.094
I'm going back to Bangkok.

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:24.082
It should be better than taking care of an amnesia patient like you.

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:25.751
I don't want to be a burden.

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:27.691
I'll find evidence as quickly as I can.

00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:28.473
Wanna try it?

00:00:28.473 --> 00:00:29.514
Don't challenge him.

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:31.540
This one's a chicken.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.781
Shouldn't have been such a showoff.

00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:37.403
Who are you?

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.940
I'm Lava. I'm the one who saved your life.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.341
I want to remember who I am.

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:46.831
I will help you.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:35.102
Lava, wake up.

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:36.539
Lava!

00:01:37.358 --> 00:01:38.412
Lava, wake up!

00:01:38.412 --> 00:01:40.510
Lava!

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.533
Ugh… What?

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.491
This hungover guy wants to sleep.

00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:45.136
Wake up and talk to me about the watch first.

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:47.012
What watch?

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.499
The one I'm wearing.

00:01:49.587 --> 00:01:50.615
Where did it come from?

00:01:50.903 --> 00:01:52.763
It's yours.

00:01:54.372 --> 00:01:55.040
Mine?

00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:58.693
But I've never had a watch.

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:04.594
I found it with you
when you washed up on the beach.

00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.778
It's yours. I found it together.

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:10.431
But you told me you didn't find anything.

00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:14.909
I lied.

00:02:16.214 --> 00:02:18.492
I was mad you dropped my phone
in the water.

00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:19.581
You!

00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:21.375
This is my only clue.

00:02:22.127 --> 00:02:23.261
You're a thief!

00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:26.327
What kind of thief?

00:02:26.902 --> 00:02:29.118
If I was a thief, I would be a reformed one.

00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:33.046
I even gave it back to you.
I was going to sell it first.

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:35.899
Wow, you'd sell it?

00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:41.007
How can I trust you, you criminal!?

00:02:42.423 --> 00:02:43.840
Ow! Ouch!

00:03:09.073 --> 00:03:10.120
Wave, open the door.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.809
I need to pee!

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.368
Wave! I'm bursting.
Open the door!

00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:22.729
Hurry up.
I need to pee!

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.071
Wait. I'm taking a shower.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.891
I can't hold it.

00:03:42.243 --> 00:03:43.440
I almost couldn't hold it.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.667
Hurry up.

00:03:58.397 --> 00:03:59.426
I haven't even soaped yet.

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:01.958
I saw you go in ages ago.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.214
What were you doing?

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:04.348
Why?

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.411
I'm someone who loves cleanliness.

00:04:18.227 --> 00:04:19.430
It's natural.

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:21.411
Why are you shy?

00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:27.732
Who's shy?

00:04:29.524 --> 00:04:30.845
I'm just showering.

00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:32.728
Why should I be shy?

00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:38.746
By the way, nice body.

00:04:40.383 --> 00:04:41.733
Nice chest muscles.

00:04:41.844 --> 00:04:42.385
Hey,

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:44.960
don't sexually harass me.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.367
You stared at my butt crack.

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:47.332
I didn't say a word.

00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:51.780
Because it's sexy, right?

00:04:53.174 --> 00:04:54.449
Can't help yourself, huh?

00:04:56.507 --> 00:04:59.611
You can look, but don't touch.

00:05:00.208 --> 00:05:01.353
Who wants to touch you?

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.437
You barged into the bathroom

00:05:06.742 --> 00:05:08.443
and showed me first.

00:05:10.523 --> 00:05:12.027
I didn't want to see.

00:05:17.293 --> 00:05:18.395
And from what I saw,

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:22.573
it's nothing special.

00:05:25.538 --> 00:05:27.067
That was just a preview.

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:31.407
You haven't seen the full squeeze yet.

00:06:45.827 --> 00:06:46.729
Have you ever seen him before?

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:47.767
Does he look familiar?

00:06:47.767 --> 00:06:48.803
No.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.181
Have you ever seen him before?

00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:50.944
Never.

00:06:51.386 --> 00:06:53.320
Look properly. Look closely.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.499
Have you ever seen him before?

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:55.461
Never.

00:06:56.612 --> 00:06:57.703
Look closely

00:06:58.145 --> 00:06:59.646
No, really.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.059
Okay, thank you.

00:07:11.215 --> 00:07:12.694
Hurry, I'm hungry.

00:07:14.154 --> 00:07:15.918
I feel like I've been here before.

00:07:17.068 --> 00:07:17.959
You have?

00:07:18.424 --> 00:07:21.368
You think that because
I said it's the last place?

00:07:22.098 --> 00:07:23.179
No, seriously.

00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:27.884
The building looks familiar.

00:07:28.503 --> 00:07:29.864
Then ask the staff.

00:07:34.798 --> 00:07:37.618
Hey, you don't need to hold my hand.

00:07:38.016 --> 00:07:38.949
Come on.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.949
Last night you let me hug you tight.

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:41.905
You didn't even move.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.854
Let's go.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.479
Excuse me.

00:07:49.944 --> 00:07:50.595
Hi.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.437
Hello.

00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:53.617
Can you help me?

00:07:53.617 --> 00:07:56.166
He's been attacked.

00:07:56.166 --> 00:07:57.182
He's lost his memory.

00:07:57.182 --> 00:07:58.912
I'm looking for his relatives.

00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:00.798
Do you know if he stayed here?

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.784
Oh, really?

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.301
Poor guy.

00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:06.317
No one's contacted you?

00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:09.191
Police have no leads.

00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:14.735
He doesn't look familiar.

00:08:15.023 --> 00:08:17.418
I haven't seen him before.

00:08:19.542 --> 00:08:20.191
Really?

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.915
But you look really familiar to me.

00:08:24.242 --> 00:08:26.755
Really? But I've never met you.

00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:29.711
Maybe my face is common.

00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:31.960
People here look like me.

00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:35.775
Yes, everyone here looks like you.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.052
Maybe he's mistaken.

00:08:37.052 --> 00:08:37.652
Yes.

00:08:38.448 --> 00:08:39.378
How about this?

00:08:39.555 --> 00:08:42.000
Can I take a photo to ask around the island?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.727
Sure.

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:47.317
Include me too?

00:08:48.335 --> 00:08:49.257
Sure.

00:08:50.695 --> 00:08:52.060
Smile.

00:08:52.746 --> 00:08:54.723
How can you frown while taking a photo?

00:08:56.028 --> 00:08:57.240
Do the peace sign.

00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:02.470
Double peace sign.

00:09:04.948 --> 00:09:05.648
Smile.

00:09:08.856 --> 00:09:12.000
Okay. If you hear anything, please tell me.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.721
Sure.

00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:13.791
Thank you. Goodbye.

00:09:13.791 --> 00:09:14.603
Goodbye.

00:09:19.205 --> 00:09:21.008
Let's go.

00:09:25.735 --> 00:09:27.200
Hurry.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.602
KHANOMJEEN UNCLE LUANG –
HOT TREAT
Whoa.

00:09:39.487 --> 00:09:43.942
But I still have doubts about that employee.

00:09:44.561 --> 00:09:45.518
Curious about what?

00:09:47.708 --> 00:09:50.389
He looked shocked when he saw me.

00:09:51.584 --> 00:09:53.616
Do you think he's the one
who assaulted you?

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.929
Why would he do that?

00:09:58.075 --> 00:09:59.343
I don't know either.

00:09:59.608 --> 00:10:01.560
We'll investigate later.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.445
For now, try this.

00:10:05.352 --> 00:10:08.284
Boiled eggs with rice noodles.

00:10:08.527 --> 00:10:09.165
The best!

00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:21.261
Mmm. Super delicious!

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:26.385
I told you it's good.

00:10:45.995 --> 00:10:46.651
Hey!

00:10:47.227 --> 00:10:48.569
You're eating like a kid.

00:10:54.764 --> 00:10:58.019
Ugh!! What's this?!

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.075
I'm sorry. My shop's old. Rainwater drips.

00:11:06.075 --> 00:11:06.879
Roof leaks.

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:08.661
Come on, why didn't you fix it?

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.341
Other customers might sue you.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.186
I want to, but I have no money.

00:11:14.297 --> 00:11:15.726
Sales are bad.

00:11:15.726 --> 00:11:17.124
I'm sorry.

00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:18.938
Please don't sue me.

00:11:18.938 --> 00:11:19.498
Please.

00:11:19.498 --> 00:11:21.277
I'm not suing you.

00:11:21.277 --> 00:11:23.846
It's fine. Just saying.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.665
Here's the towel.

00:11:29.028 --> 00:11:30.226
I'm alright.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.265
When you want to pick me up, bring me fish.

00:11:50.663 --> 00:11:53.595
If I have to eat sour curry every day,
it's your fault.

00:11:55.409 --> 00:11:56.547
Your car broke down,

00:11:56.679 --> 00:11:58.303
so I wanted to drop you at work.

00:11:59.808 --> 00:12:01.506
If they know we're dating,

00:12:01.993 --> 00:12:03.532
no excuses needed.

00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:08.334
Be patient a little longer.

00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:10.372
Alright?

00:12:14.598 --> 00:12:17.000
The director asked me to run for village chief.

00:12:17.465 --> 00:12:18.158
Really?

00:12:18.954 --> 00:12:20.240
Will you?

00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:26.587
I don't know. I'm an outsider working here.

00:12:27.472 --> 00:12:28.947
Will anyone vote for me?

00:12:31.779 --> 00:12:33.424
You can do it.

00:12:34.154 --> 00:12:38.156
I've always wanted my boyfriend
to be a village chief.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.961
Then level up to district head,

00:12:44.647 --> 00:12:49.092
then governor, maybe even PM.

00:12:50.486 --> 00:12:53.894
What if I'm just a small resort owner?

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:58.181
Do you still want to be with me?

00:13:02.164 --> 00:13:05.754
I'd be with you no matter what
as long as I'm yours.

00:13:08.762 --> 00:13:10.289
Go work now.

00:13:20.524 --> 00:13:21.221
I'm off.

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:34.507
Hello. What can I do for you today?

00:13:35.547 --> 00:13:37.415
I'm here to register for the election.

00:13:38.432 --> 00:13:39.035
Sure.

00:13:40.805 --> 00:13:42.658
Please fill out the form.

00:13:52.382 --> 00:13:55.811
How much will you give us?

00:13:56.541 --> 00:13:59.133
Wait. Who said I'd sell it?

00:13:59.133 --> 00:13:59.698
Eh?

00:14:00.384 --> 00:14:05.284
Then why keep it? Life on the island costs.

00:14:05.284 --> 00:14:07.656
Feeding you isn't easy either.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.334
Sell it and share 30% with me.

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:14.305
Why must I do that?

00:14:14.305 --> 00:14:17.249
I found the watch, found you,

00:14:17.249 --> 00:14:18.504
and saved your life.

00:14:18.747 --> 00:14:20.213
Don't I get something?

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.676
Even a dog gets a bone. A cat gets treats.

00:14:23.676 --> 00:14:24.858
I should get something.

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:27.601
Try doing good without expecting anything.

00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:29.720
It's good for the heart.

00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:31.085
I've done that all the time,

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.299
and I only got bad luck.

00:14:32.564 --> 00:14:34.173
If I sell and share the money,

00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:35.958
will you stop bringing it up?

00:14:36.223 --> 00:14:38.242
Yeah. Include principal and interest.

00:14:38.242 --> 00:14:39.314
I'm expensive.

00:14:39.314 --> 00:14:40.631
Why act so cheap?

00:14:42.157 --> 00:14:42.966
Are you insulting me?

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:43.942
Maybe I'm insulting him.

00:14:43.942 --> 00:14:46.405
Hey, don't drag me in.

00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:49.319
You two are selling or not?

00:14:50.226 --> 00:14:52.503
If I sell, how much?

00:14:54.096 --> 00:14:55.258
50,000 max.

00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:58.057
See? It's damaged.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.580
Sand inside is hard to clean.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.843
Don't be tricky.

00:15:04.086 --> 00:15:07.212
I checked. This model's worth 100,000.

00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:09.937
Then 60,000.

00:15:11.065 --> 00:15:12.254
60,000?

00:15:14.201 --> 00:15:14.964
Hey.

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:17.255
Let's sell somewhere else.

00:15:17.432 --> 00:15:18.982
We'll get more money for sure.

00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:23.753
Wait!

00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:51.035
You draw pretty well.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.269
I studied architecture.

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:56.708
Of course I can draw.

00:16:00.266 --> 00:16:04.051
Are you redesigning the shop for Uncle?

00:16:05.716 --> 00:16:08.820
Yeah. I want to start a small business.

00:16:11.854 --> 00:16:13.032
Can I take a closer look?

00:16:20.258 --> 00:16:20.850
Wow,

00:16:23.292 --> 00:16:24.978
you're not as bad as I thought.

00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:27.564
You even want to help people.

00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:31.523
I just want to be useful.

00:16:32.115 --> 00:16:33.714
People have looked down on me
my whole life.

00:16:36.137 --> 00:16:37.451
Then let me help too.

00:16:37.802 --> 00:16:39.588
I want to be useful as well.

00:16:40.476 --> 00:16:41.154
Fine.

00:16:41.524 --> 00:16:43.054
Just don't get in my way.

00:16:44.386 --> 00:16:45.164
Ow!

00:16:48.445 --> 00:16:49.750
You're in my way already.

00:16:50.767 --> 00:16:51.931
Lava! Wave!

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.601
Kratae? What are you doing here?

00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:58.005
I'm passing by.

00:16:58.005 --> 00:17:01.604
Dr. Wut asked me to check on Wave.

00:17:01.974 --> 00:17:03.399
How's your memory?

00:17:05.156 --> 00:17:05.983
Still nothing.

00:17:06.963 --> 00:17:09.166
It's like my brain knows how to do things,

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.320
but not my personal memories.

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:14.421
It'll take time.

00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:19.285
Dr. Wut said to go out often,
and do things.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:24.370
It can probably trigger the senses of sight, taste, smell,
and sound that you're familiar with.

00:17:24.814 --> 00:17:27.450
Lava, please take him out more.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.938
And don't forget his hospital checkups.

00:17:32.714 --> 00:17:33.365
Sure.

00:17:34.481 --> 00:17:37.234
Wow, who drew this?

00:17:39.694 --> 00:17:41.247
Lava?

00:17:41.617 --> 00:17:43.810
Whoa. You've got talent.

00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:47.042
Draw me sometime.

00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:49.493
Sure.

00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:51.453
Pretty faces are easy.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.378
Say things like that and I'll flirt.

00:17:53.693 --> 00:17:54.868
You promised.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.882
Yeah.

00:17:58.658 --> 00:18:01.332
Anyway, I'll go now. Bye, Wave.

00:18:06.326 --> 00:18:07.814
Kratae is cute, isn't she?

00:19:08.785 --> 00:19:09.494
What are you doing?

00:19:15.025 --> 00:19:16.628
You left your underwear out.

00:19:17.072 --> 00:19:18.035
That's messy.

00:19:18.146 --> 00:19:20.087
I'm putting it in the basket.

00:19:29.398 --> 00:19:31.084
You're not sniffing it, right?

00:19:31.491 --> 00:19:33.564
Don't accuse me.

00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:35.142
I'm not a pervert.

00:19:35.567 --> 00:19:36.517
Who knows?

00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:39.706
Maybe you sniffed someone's underwear
and got hit with a paddle.

00:19:39.706 --> 00:19:40.756
That's how you washed up here.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.581
I'm absolutely not that kind of person.

00:19:45.612 --> 00:19:46.303
Ouch!

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.108
KHANOMJEEN UNCLE LUANG –
HOT TREAT

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:15.950
Eh?

00:20:17.152 --> 00:20:18.754
You're blocking the way like a boss.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.460
Why not help instead?

00:20:22.384 --> 00:20:24.437
I don't know where to start.

00:20:26.435 --> 00:20:29.954
He's sawing wood, and someone's painting.

00:20:30.324 --> 00:20:31.448
Can you just pick one?

00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:35.369
Move!

00:20:44.151 --> 00:20:46.020
You'll cut your hand if you do it like that.

00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:47.611
Move.

00:20:53.068 --> 00:20:54.301
It's not that hard.

00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:05.428
Whoa!

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.331
You fell right into my arms on purpose?

00:21:12.902 --> 00:21:13.861
Don't meddle.

00:21:45.752 --> 00:21:46.516
Beautiful.

00:21:47.644 --> 00:21:48.778
I know.

00:21:51.719 --> 00:21:54.742
I meant the flower you drew.

00:21:55.242 --> 00:21:57.447
Why'd you think I meant you?

00:21:57.447 --> 00:21:59.844
Yeah, Tum, come on.

00:22:00.177 --> 00:22:01.580
No need to compliment me.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.138
I know I'm beautiful.

00:22:03.415 --> 00:22:07.343
My beauty doesn't need men's approval,

00:22:07.842 --> 00:22:09.273
especially not from men like you.

00:22:16.783 --> 00:22:18.234
By the way,

00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:20.877
you're handsome too.

00:22:21.728 --> 00:22:22.688
Just found out?

00:22:25.352 --> 00:22:26.947
Ow! Aah!

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.340
Kratae!

00:22:41.394 --> 00:22:43.229
How is it? Are you feeling cooler now?

00:22:47.428 --> 00:22:50.467
In this heat, drink something refreshing.

00:22:53.815 --> 00:22:56.654
Yeah, Thai weather's like hell.

00:23:07.785 --> 00:23:09.205
How is it? Refreshing?

00:23:09.686 --> 00:23:11.221
Very.

00:23:14.064 --> 00:23:14.822
I'll keep going.

00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:37.914
Sweat's running into your mouth.

00:23:39.727 --> 00:23:40.459
Thanks.

00:23:41.328 --> 00:23:42.014
No problem.

00:23:43.216 --> 00:23:44.083
It's good.

00:23:44.915 --> 00:23:46.402
It's like I'm working too.

00:23:47.845 --> 00:23:48.477
Working?

00:23:49.217 --> 00:23:51.741
My job is taking care of you.

00:24:07.651 --> 00:24:08.951
Dad, give me 1,000.

00:24:09.598 --> 00:24:11.234
I don't have 1,000.

00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:13.741
Help me rebuild the shop first.

00:24:14.203 --> 00:24:14.943
Then I'll give you money.

00:24:16.035 --> 00:24:16.965
Let's talk about that later.

00:24:17.057 --> 00:24:19.188
My friends are waiting.

00:24:19.481 --> 00:24:20.322
I said I don't have it.

00:24:21.117 --> 00:24:22.576
Business has been bad lately.

00:24:23.112 --> 00:24:24.511
Stop stalling, Dad.

00:24:24.511 --> 00:24:25.632
I'll pay you back.

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:28.445
I said no.

00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:30.419
You worthless kid.

00:24:30.419 --> 00:24:32.832
You don't help, and you ask for money.

00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:35.340
Hey, I said I won't give you!

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:35.965
Give it, Dad.

00:24:35.965 --> 00:24:37.236
You're using it for drugs, right?

00:24:37.236 --> 00:24:39.704
Hey! You can't treat your dad like this!

00:24:39.889 --> 00:24:40.737
Mind your business!

00:24:40.737 --> 00:24:41.630
You're just a worker.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.584
Worker? Damn it.

00:24:42.584 --> 00:24:43.681
I came to help your dad for free.

00:24:43.681 --> 00:24:45.036
Have you ever helped him?

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.518
You're not from around here, are you?

00:24:51.721 --> 00:24:52.707
Don't act tough.

00:24:52.707 --> 00:24:53.893
I don't care where I'm from.

00:24:53.921 --> 00:24:55.502
At least I'm not trash to my dad like you.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.649
- Enough, Lava.
- Enough.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:01.534
Take the money.

00:25:02.478 --> 00:25:03.290
Take it!

00:25:04.481 --> 00:25:05.725
And stay away from my shop!

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.399
Thanks a lot.

00:25:16.972 --> 00:25:19.051
Otherwise he'd take it all.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:20.912
You shouldn't have given him.

00:25:22.318 --> 00:25:23.305
He's still my son.

00:25:24.026 --> 00:25:25.561
Hopefully he learns one day.

00:25:27.355 --> 00:25:30.318
Your dad must be proud to have you.

00:25:35.723 --> 00:25:37.445
Come on, let's get back to work.

00:26:03.872 --> 00:26:04.748
Wanna race?

00:26:04.748 --> 00:26:05.480
Come on!

00:26:05.847 --> 00:26:08.723
No. No!

00:26:10.061 --> 00:26:10.781
No!

00:26:11.368 --> 00:26:11.868
Don't!

00:26:11.868 --> 00:26:13.070
Why not?

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.926
Ugh!!!

00:26:17.263 --> 00:26:17.985
Woohoo!

00:26:17.985 --> 00:26:19.287
Lava, drive slower!

00:26:19.287 --> 00:26:20.112
Why? Are you scared?

00:26:20.735 --> 00:26:21.689
No!

00:26:21.689 --> 00:26:23.360
- Stop filming content now!
- Just a bit, okay?

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.080
No, just drive.

00:26:26.263 --> 00:26:28.225
Tum, eyes on the road!

00:26:28.225 --> 00:26:28.997
Stop!

00:26:29.565 --> 00:26:31.018
Slower!

00:26:32.778 --> 00:26:33.503
Woohoo!

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:38.895
Hurry up.

00:26:43.818 --> 00:26:45.821
The weather is so good today.

00:26:45.821 --> 00:26:47.845
Today's weather forecast says

00:26:47.845 --> 00:26:50.779
there will be waves crashing in
from time to time.

00:26:51.457 --> 00:26:52.229
How'd you know?

00:26:52.651 --> 00:26:53.691
My dad's Poseidon.

00:26:59.925 --> 00:27:01.446
Go ahead and stare.

00:27:01.446 --> 00:27:03.163
I know you can't resist.

00:27:05.272 --> 00:27:06.600
I want to, of course,

00:27:06.967 --> 00:27:08.941
but being a gentleman stops me.

00:27:09.895 --> 00:27:11.885
Lava, rub sunscreen on my back.

00:27:24.537 --> 00:27:25.415
Other side too.

00:27:28.239 --> 00:27:29.068
All done.

00:27:30.021 --> 00:27:30.729
Thanks.

00:27:30.729 --> 00:27:31.555
Do you want me to do it for you?

00:27:32.068 --> 00:27:33.245
No, I'll do it myself.

00:27:33.557 --> 00:27:36.521
Okay, I'm going to swim.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.913
Damn it. The one
wanting to do that for her is right here.

00:27:46.132 --> 00:27:49.159
Anyway, I won't give up!

00:27:56.651 --> 00:27:57.885
Bring it on!

00:27:58.013 --> 00:27:58.695
Wait for me!

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.211
Wait!

00:28:17.764 --> 00:28:18.294
Wave,

00:28:19.871 --> 00:28:20.908
rub sunscreen on me.

00:28:25.432 --> 00:28:27.750
Didn't you tell Kratae
you'd do it yourself?

00:28:28.392 --> 00:28:29.519
I want you to do it.

00:28:40.649 --> 00:28:42.111
Kratae seems to like you.

00:28:43.725 --> 00:28:44.378
Like what?

00:28:44.378 --> 00:28:45.663
As a friend?

00:28:48.523 --> 00:28:51.032
You know Tum likes Kratae, right?

00:28:53.416 --> 00:28:54.044
Yeah,

00:28:55.107 --> 00:28:56.238
but I wasn't thinking anything.

00:28:56.587 --> 00:28:57.468
I'm just friendly.

00:28:58.642 --> 00:28:59.520
Also,

00:29:01.189 --> 00:29:02.274
I don't like women.

00:29:06.198 --> 00:29:07.149
I like men.

00:29:12.473 --> 00:29:13.191
What about you?

00:29:14.878 --> 00:29:23.335
Do amnesia people remember
their sexual preference?

00:29:29.514 --> 00:29:30.658
I'm not sure.

00:29:31.923 --> 00:29:33.360
It might take time to find out.

00:29:35.084 --> 00:29:35.997
Do you want me to help you?

00:29:39.463 --> 00:29:40.191
Help how?

00:29:40.998 --> 00:29:42.686
Help you find out what you like.

00:30:09.746 --> 00:30:11.850
Shit, Wave!

00:30:12.889 --> 00:30:15.361
This SPF level is way up in the hundreds!

00:30:15.709 --> 00:30:16.450
I'm sorry.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:18.392
I didn't mean it.

00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:19.787
Are you messing with me?

00:30:20.557 --> 00:30:21.290
Fine.

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.298
Take it yourself.

00:30:23.875 --> 00:30:25.843
No need. I can do it myself.

00:30:26.155 --> 00:30:27.565
I don't like people touching me.

00:30:27.657 --> 00:30:28.678
Gold-plated body, huh?

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.415
So cocky.

00:30:31.562 --> 00:30:32.322
Fine.

00:30:32.469 --> 00:30:33.235
Expensive, yeah.

00:30:33.418 --> 00:30:34.303
Super.

00:30:34.557 --> 00:30:35.705
Super expensive.

00:30:35.705 --> 00:30:37.402
I've got to find out
who you were before

00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:38.635
to act like this.

00:30:54.039 --> 00:30:56.707
Wave, come swim with us!

00:31:01.731 --> 00:31:02.690
Come on!

00:31:03.166 --> 00:31:04.748
I didn't bring spare clothes.

00:31:05.005 --> 00:31:06.518
Just go naked.

00:31:06.518 --> 00:31:07.329
We're all the same.

00:31:08.172 --> 00:31:10.140
I'm not like you guys!

00:31:11.076 --> 00:31:11.859
Idiot!

00:31:14.649 --> 00:31:15.555
Come play with us.

00:31:16.802 --> 00:31:17.563
No, thanks.

00:31:19.158 --> 00:31:19.914
Come on.

00:31:22.701 --> 00:31:23.423
No.

00:31:23.649 --> 00:31:24.686
Take it off.

00:31:27.546 --> 00:31:29.407
Take your hand off. Don't mess with me.

00:31:29.884 --> 00:31:31.316
Join us.

00:31:32.308 --> 00:31:33.300
Don't you want friends?

00:31:40.415 --> 00:31:41.075
Fine.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:51.988
Stay out of it!

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.386
Why are you playing so hard to get?

00:31:57.523 --> 00:31:58.557
You'll be the one who's going to get played.

00:32:04.278 --> 00:32:06.107
Hey, call Wave to swim!

00:32:06.382 --> 00:32:08.044
Come down!

00:32:08.044 --> 00:32:08.755
Don't!

00:32:55.421 --> 00:32:58.719
Hey, taking chances
to touch me, huh?

00:33:01.488 --> 00:33:02.662
You're a bad driver.

00:33:03.469 --> 00:33:04.822
I drive fine.

00:33:11.258 --> 00:33:12.628
Again?!

00:33:15.268 --> 00:33:16.403
Drive properly, will you?

00:33:18.677 --> 00:33:19.893
Do you have feelings for me?

00:33:30.523 --> 00:33:31.216
What's wrong?

00:33:33.518 --> 00:33:35.207
That pickup truck is following us.

00:33:36.234 --> 00:33:37.502
Why not pass?

00:33:42.526 --> 00:33:43.429
Ahhh!

00:33:43.759 --> 00:33:44.645
Ouch!

00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:49.597
F*ck!

00:33:53.429 --> 00:33:54.104
Are you okay?

00:33:58.579 --> 00:34:01.059
I'm fine. You?

00:34:02.049 --> 00:34:02.599
I'm okay.

00:34:03.736 --> 00:34:05.935
They were aiming to kill.

00:34:09.474 --> 00:34:13.239
It could be the noodle shop uncle's son.

00:34:16.246 --> 00:34:17.059
That's possible.

00:34:18.526 --> 00:34:21.161
But they meant to kill.

00:34:21.858 --> 00:34:23.030
Don't you think it's too far?

00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:24.773
When someone's hell-bent on revenge,

00:34:25.671 --> 00:34:28.376
even little things turn fatal.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.186
Lottery tickets!

00:34:32.333 --> 00:34:33.869
Today's your lucky day!

00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:34.369
Ahhh!

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:40.395
Hey!

00:34:43.805 --> 00:34:44.607
What the hell!

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.926
Why the hell did you kick my bike?!

00:34:46.926 --> 00:34:47.431
Eh?

00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:49.159
You hit that aunt.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:50.227
Won't you even stop and check on her?

00:34:50.227 --> 00:34:51.627
No one died. Done.

00:34:51.627 --> 00:34:52.944
How can you say that?

00:34:53.146 --> 00:34:54.193
Take responsibility!

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.708
You're her kid, asshole?

00:34:55.708 --> 00:34:57.715
What if it was your mom?

00:34:57.898 --> 00:34:58.945
Since you're talking like this,

00:34:59.092 --> 00:35:00.542
I'll let the police handle this.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.266
What are you doing?

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:04.057
Move. I'm taking a picture of the plate.

00:35:04.057 --> 00:35:05.128
Why take a picture?

00:35:05.128 --> 00:35:05.702
Move!

00:35:05.702 --> 00:35:06.301
Why?!

00:35:20.237 --> 00:35:21.384
Dad, you didn't have to let him off.

00:35:22.117 --> 00:35:23.141
He hurt her.

00:35:23.489 --> 00:35:24.881
But you kicked his bike first.

00:35:25.321 --> 00:35:27.657
You're at fault too.

00:35:29.252 --> 00:35:31.301
If I hadn't kicked,
he wouldn't have stopped.

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.965
I'm proud you helped,

00:35:36.607 --> 00:35:39.704
but be calmer next time.

00:35:40.382 --> 00:35:41.283
You can help,

00:35:42.126 --> 00:35:43.593
but don't risk your life.

00:35:45.665 --> 00:35:46.660
-Okay.
-Let's go.

00:35:48.218 --> 00:35:49.033
Where are you going?!

00:35:51.142 --> 00:35:52.265
You got me fired!

00:35:52.393 --> 00:35:53.483
My bike's ruined.

00:35:53.905 --> 00:35:54.697
You did it to yourself.

00:35:55.027 --> 00:35:56.248
Driving like an asshole

00:35:56.431 --> 00:35:57.565
and hurting that aunt!

00:35:57.657 --> 00:35:59.337
You shouldn't drive for life.

00:35:59.649 --> 00:36:00.657
Enough, Lava.

00:36:02.491 --> 00:36:05.073
We cleared things up.
Let's just end this now.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.771
But I'm not ending it.

00:36:08.623 --> 00:36:09.123
Hey!

00:36:10.883 --> 00:36:11.464
Dad!

00:36:12.986 --> 00:36:13.564
Dad!

00:36:14.224 --> 00:36:14.747
Dad!

00:36:18.598 --> 00:36:19.256
Dad!

00:36:19.571 --> 00:36:20.673
Someone help!

00:36:21.113 --> 00:36:21.735
Dad!

00:36:23.202 --> 00:36:24.533
Someone help!

00:36:32.876 --> 00:36:33.376
Doc,

00:36:34.557 --> 00:36:36.041
I registered for village head.

00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:38.182
Really?

00:36:39.142 --> 00:36:40.389
I didn't think you'd do it.

00:36:41.293 --> 00:36:41.891
Yeah.

00:36:42.408 --> 00:36:44.383
I'll be here a long time.

00:36:44.826 --> 00:36:49.599
I want to make this place nice to live,
boost tourism, and the economy too.

00:36:50.116 --> 00:36:51.665
So young people will come back,

00:36:52.108 --> 00:36:53.961
not struggle to find jobs in Bangkok.

00:36:55.105 --> 00:36:57.234
With policies focusing on
local development like this,

00:36:57.677 --> 00:36:59.068
I'm sure it'll win people's hearts.

00:37:01.504 --> 00:37:02.750
Yours too?

00:37:04.559 --> 00:37:05.969
Getting to cuddle like this,

00:37:06.227 --> 00:37:07.478
you've had my heart for a while now.

00:37:10.338 --> 00:37:12.032
If I'm the village head,

00:37:12.862 --> 00:37:14.915
I can ask you to marry me easier.

00:37:16.078 --> 00:37:17.549
I don't think that matters.

00:37:17.955 --> 00:37:19.998
My parents won't care anyway.

00:37:21.733 --> 00:37:26.231
But I'll prove I can take care of you.

00:37:28.741 --> 00:37:30.494
Don't worry too much about me.

00:37:31.011 --> 00:37:32.688
Only you think that way.

00:37:33.924 --> 00:37:35.414
Don't be so hard on yourself.

00:37:36.078 --> 00:37:36.679
Understand?

00:37:38.266 --> 00:37:39.087
I do.

00:37:43.387 --> 00:37:45.925
So… I'll have a boyfriend
who's the village head?

00:37:50.483 --> 00:37:52.837
Uncle Peng, got food?

00:37:55.568 --> 00:37:56.325
Where is he?

00:38:00.662 --> 00:38:03.039
Uncle! I'm hungry!

00:38:06.914 --> 00:38:09.454
But his car's still here.

00:38:18.956 --> 00:38:19.456
Hey,

00:38:20.305 --> 00:38:21.330
there's a guest upstairs?

00:38:22.105 --> 00:38:23.757
The light keeps flickering.

00:38:23.757 --> 00:38:24.786
He's not going to fix it, huh?

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:43.300
I'll help you campaign at the hospital.

00:38:44.795 --> 00:38:46.148
What's the slogan?

00:38:46.443 --> 00:38:47.366
How about,

00:38:47.366 --> 00:38:51.513
“Handsome guy at your service.
Together we grow, our island progresses”?

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.229
Using my looks to win votes?

00:38:55.908 --> 00:38:58.829
Alright. I'll go all out.

00:39:01.948 --> 00:39:07.049
You can charm, but don't go too far.

00:39:07.418 --> 00:39:07.992
Got it?

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.916
Who'd dare?

00:39:15.533 --> 00:39:16.059
Hey!

00:39:24.363 --> 00:39:24.864
Wait.

00:39:42.469 --> 00:39:43.156
Lava!

00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.935
Wave!

00:40:28.954 --> 00:40:32.278
It's surprising that
Uncle Peng and Dr. Wut are boyfriends.

00:40:33.644 --> 00:40:34.163
Yeah.

00:40:35.363 --> 00:40:38.323
But why would they need to hide it from me?

00:40:40.279 --> 00:40:41.852
If he wanted you to know,

00:40:42.738 --> 00:40:44.614
he'd introduce him.

00:40:46.589 --> 00:40:47.947
They must have their reasons.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:49.500
What reasons?

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:52.763
They think I can't accept it?

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:56.496
I'm the biggest supporter.

00:40:58.231 --> 00:40:59.647
Wait until he's ready.

00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:03.234
He'll tell you himself.

00:41:04.249 --> 00:41:05.420
Don't be so nosy.

00:41:09.222 --> 00:41:10.244
Ahhh!

00:41:21.501 --> 00:41:22.591
What's that sound?

00:41:23.255 --> 00:41:24.198
That blast sounded like a bomb.

00:41:25.471 --> 00:41:27.296
The power went out
because the transformer blew up.

00:41:27.296 --> 00:41:28.701
It happens on the island often.

00:41:29.347 --> 00:41:31.535
But why today when it's so hot?

00:41:32.236 --> 00:41:33.172
What's wrong with you?

00:41:34.556 --> 00:41:35.254
I got startled, obviously.

00:41:54.848 --> 00:41:56.337
Hey, what are you doing?

00:41:57.795 --> 00:41:58.633
Stripping, of course.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:00.874
It's too hot for clothes.

00:42:01.981 --> 00:42:03.524
At least I'm considerate.

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.858
Otherwise, I'd take off my underwear too.

00:42:06.209 --> 00:42:07.306
Should I?

00:42:15.498 --> 00:42:16.521
Why are you under the blanket?

00:42:19.732 --> 00:42:20.533
Aren't you hot?

00:42:23.385 --> 00:42:24.141
I'm fine.

00:42:25.857 --> 00:42:26.759
I can handle it.

00:42:37.882 --> 00:42:39.373
Sweating like this?

00:42:45.766 --> 00:42:46.771
It's not that much.

00:42:54.133 --> 00:42:54.881
Move over.

00:42:56.819 --> 00:42:57.631
I'm feeling uneasy.

00:43:01.396 --> 00:43:04.726
Uneasy…or turned on?

00:43:11.628 --> 00:43:12.819
I think I know now…

00:43:15.255 --> 00:43:16.303
about you.

00:43:18.665 --> 00:43:19.276
About what?

00:43:24.978 --> 00:43:29.234
About whether you like women or men.

00:43:33.072 --> 00:43:34.036
How would you know?

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.050
Remember what Kratae said?

00:43:57.601 --> 00:44:05.354
Memories are stimulated
through senses and touch.

00:45:06.073 --> 00:45:07.163
So you're aware now, huh?

00:45:57.183 --> 00:45:59.671
Will you tell Uncle Peng that you've already found out about Dr. Wut?

00:45:59.671 --> 00:46:01.954
Not yet. Let me dig a bit more.

00:46:02.194 --> 00:46:02.969
Uncle, aren't you lonely?

00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:03.912
Why would I be?

00:46:03.912 --> 00:46:04.557
Don't you want a partner?

00:46:04.778 --> 00:46:06.959
Dr. Wut's always right.

00:46:08.103 --> 00:46:08.703
Shut it!

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:12.159
How can lovers hide and still be happy?

00:46:13.489 --> 00:46:16.288
I've got proof that'll make you realize who you are.

00:46:16.288 --> 00:46:18.483
Last night, why did you kiss me?

00:46:18.852 --> 00:46:20.330
I just wanted to test you.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:20.940
Test what?

00:46:21.531 --> 00:46:25.340
If you like men, and if you like me.

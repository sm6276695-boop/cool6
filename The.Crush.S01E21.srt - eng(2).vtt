00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.040
Have you seen this lady?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.840
No, I haven't.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.760
Thank you.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.440
Have you seen this girl?

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.280
Excuse me.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.240
Have you seen my wife?

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.960
(Steamed Bun)

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.520
Zixuan.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.560
Don't panic too much.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.640
I believe

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.680
she will

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.200
be alright.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.360
Excuse me, have you seen
this young lady?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.960
No.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.000
Excuse me.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.480
Have you seen this lady?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.760
Young Master.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.760
Please eat something.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.160
Didn't I tell you to report it?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.680
What did the officials say?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.760
What did they say?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.520
They said

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.400
the fire destroyed everything,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.000
but someone claimed
to have seen the Madam there.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.160
They also found the Madam's bracelet.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.440
Young Master.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.680
I refuse to believe it.
We must find her.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.760
Go immediately.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.000
Young Master, I...

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.120
Ning An,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.480
you may leave now.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.120
I'll take care of the Master.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.680
Yes.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.560
Young Master.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.520
Xiaotang is blessed.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.400
We'll definitely find her.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.480
But

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.960
you must take care of your health.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.200
She told me before

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.840
that after securing the Top Tea title,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.440
she would leave.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.320
Perhaps she just went back.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.160
Actually,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.960
I should have realized it earlier.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.000
She came to see me before the accident.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.360
She said

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
her biggest concern was you.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.200
If she ever left,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.200
she made me promise
to take good care of you.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.960
She

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.720
really said that?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.920
Earlier,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.920
because I admired you,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.960
I did something bad for her.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.560
No matter what,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.360
I can't do that again.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.840
From now on, whether as a maid,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.600
servant, or doing
dirty and exhausting work,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.840
I don't mind.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.920
As long as

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.800
I can stay at this manor

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.480
and remain by your side,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.800
I'll do anything.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.880
Miss Niaoniao,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.600
please get up.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.480
By the way, the tea estate staff
just reported

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.160
that everyone was in disarray

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.600
after you two left.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.200
Then

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.600
I'll have to trouble you

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.280
to manage the tea estate.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.920
This tea estate

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.800
was jointly managed by you two.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.800
I'll manage it well

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.960
while waiting for her.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.320
You've been overburdened
with worries lately.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.600
I brewed this calming soup for you.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.320
Good. I'll have it later.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.920
If anything comes up,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.000
I'll come to see you again tomorrow.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.800
Miss, the doctor said

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.240
if someone who's depressed

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.080
took this drug,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.400
they'd gradually become numb

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.280
and lose their senses.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.640
Stop making noise!

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.680
We found it.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.040
What's wrong with you people?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.840
We signed.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.440
We have stock!

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.040
Where's mine?

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.800
Don't rush.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.080
One at a time.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.640
One at a time.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.360
Understand?

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.760
Can you handle this? Or I'll do it.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.080
You do it. You do it.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.240
- Okay.
- I'll check it myself.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.080
- Let me.
- Let me.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080
Gentlemen,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.160
please remain calm.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.520
Miss Niaoniao.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.360
I promise

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.760
everyone here today

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that all the tea orders

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.000
will be delivered on time.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.680
Miss Niaoniao,

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.600
you finally came.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.000
Sir, Young Master Zimo is tired.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.080
Why don't you take him back to rest?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.560
I'll handle things here.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.800
Miss Niaoniao, I'm not tired.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.160
My mother said

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.280
I need to learn

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.880
- this gradually.
- You're tired.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.680
Young Master,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.560
I told you I've got this covered.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.600
Go back with your uncle.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.000
- I...
- Miss Niaoniao.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.000
Since when do you
get to be in charge here?

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.080
Sir,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.280
Young Master Zixuan entrusted
me to manage the tea estate.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.080
Also,

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.760
if I recall correctly,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.920
Zixuan explicitly stated it.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.400
You're forbidden
from setting foot in the tea estate.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.480
Come in.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.480
Close the door.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.120
Let me ask you.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.560
Did Xiaotang's accident involve you?

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.440
Madam,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.400
I don't understand you.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.760
Isn't the person who wants
Wei Xiaotang dead the most

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.680
you?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.800
Times have changed.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.760
Earlier, Zimo got into trouble,

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.440
and Xiaotang found a way to save him.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.400
I owe her.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.760
Madam,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.840
have you lost your mind?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.560
How can you be talking about favors now?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.840
Now that Xiaotang is gone,

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.280
and Zixuan is depressed,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.000
this is Young Master Zimo's chance.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.320
Isn't it?

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.120
What exactly did you do to Xiaotang?

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.920
If you don't explain clearly,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.440
I'll tell Zixuan immediately

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.440
you're not actually his savior.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.280
Madam,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.840
back then, you insisted

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.560
that I saved Zixuan.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.960
You're the one
who let me enter this manor.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.280
And you gave me that drug.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.120
At first,

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.120
how could I have imagined

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.120
you'd harbor such ambitions?

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.240
What ambitions?

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.840
I merely followed your instructions

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.600
to enter the manor to care for Zixuan

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.440
and incidentally manage
your family's affairs.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.920
You truly treat the tea estate

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.920
as your personal property?

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.320
With your status,

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.080
how dare you aim for the Madam position?

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.400
Perhaps you've forgotten

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.600
Zixuan only listens to me now.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.480
Whether I become the Madam

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.200
isn't your decision.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.840
After decades with the Li family,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.600
here's my advice to you.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.760
Don't push things

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.080
to extremes.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.240
You have no status.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.400
There's no place for you in this manor!

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.720
Madam,

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.560
who will lose their place in this manor

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.080
remains to be seen.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.160
But since you brought me here,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.880
I'll repay your kindness.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.160
Mr. Qi, thank goodness
you arrived that day.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.120
Otherwise...

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.240
When I think about it,

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.720
I still feel terrified.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.760
No need for thanks.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.880
We're friends.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.120
When friends need help,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.000
I give my all.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.280
Miss Xiaotang.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.200
Miss Xiaotang.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.840
Wake up.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.040
Mr. Qi.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.920
Two more favors to ask of you.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:45.760
Go ahead.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.600
First,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.440
can you investigate

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.200
Miss Niaoniao's true identity?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.640
Okay.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.480
Second,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.200
find out

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.240
who owns

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.520
this handkerchief.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.760
Zixuan, are you feeling better now?

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.760
Please address me as Mr. Li from now on.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.600
In the past, in this very room,

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.560
only Xiaotang would call me Zixuan.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.600
Mr. Li.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.480
Xiaotang is gone.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.800
I'm grieving, too.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.120
But I promised her
I'd take good care of you.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.800
Now, you refuse to eat anything.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.840
Everyone at the tea estate
looks down on me for having no status.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.688
It's as if even calling you Zixuan

00:11:46.688 --> 00:11:47.800
is forbidden to me.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.600
The servants don't even

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.800
show me respect,

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.320
let alone entrust me
with managing the tea estate.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.960
I spoke out of turn.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.200
As for the tea estate,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.600
I'll instruct the servants.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.280
Miss Niaoniao, please get up.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.480
Mr. Li,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.960
please give me an official status.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.960
I know you and Xiaotang
were in deep love.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.040
I have no improper intentions.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.800
I just want to care for you

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.040
and manage the tea estate

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.240
to fulfill Xiaotang's dying wish.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.280
My grief overwhelmed me,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.760
making things difficult for you.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.640
Since you're so committed,

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.000
I'll give you official status.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.480
From now on, you'll be
part of our family.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.000
Thank you.

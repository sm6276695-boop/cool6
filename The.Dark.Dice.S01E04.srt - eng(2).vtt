WEBVTT

00:00:00.494 --> 00:00:02.102
You need to help me build three rows.

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:03.977
If you refuse to do it,

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:06.499
I’ll tell everyone what you did.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.170
But more importantly,
we need to find you a piece, Kaen.

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:13.299
You don’t know, do you,
that the only reason you won that election

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.404
was because Kaen rigged it for you?

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:18.583
I’ll take responsibility for everything.

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.099
That means Mamay has five rows.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.395
But that means Kaen is…

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.490
AN ETHICAL LEADER
FOR OUR SCHOOL

00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:43.032
Hello.

00:00:43.183 --> 00:00:46.404
My name is Napassorn Chonnapattarawong.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.600
You can call me Mamay.

00:00:47.628 --> 00:00:49.173
I’m from Grade 12 Class 2.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.450
I will be running for the new student
council president election.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.448
I have always been pushing
for change at this school.

00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:02.903
I’m confident that my determination
and resolution are more than enough

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.502
to make this school a better place.

00:01:06.992 --> 00:01:08.502
Vote Number 2!

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.204
People think I do this because
I want to be in the spotlight.

00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:18.100
But that’s not true.

00:01:18.728 --> 00:01:20.438
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.182
I like that feeling you get
when you do something for somebody.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.800
I like knowing I’m useful.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.051
I like being reliable.

00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:31.072
Hi.

00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:34.303
And I like it best
when I am loved and accepted.

00:01:36.617 --> 00:01:39.902
I don’t know why I need love
and acceptance so much.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.005
Number 2!

00:01:41.026 --> 00:01:42.832
Vote Number 2!

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:44.299
Maybe I’m just…

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:47.700
trying to make up for what I lack.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:53.801
How does it feel being both
a politician and a father?

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.800
Which role would you say
is more difficult to fulfill?

00:01:59.339 --> 00:02:01.702
I must admit both roles
are just as exhausting.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.400
But I find being a father rather gratifying,

00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:12.905
knowing I have someone who always
makes me feel so proud.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.659
My son is my only pride and joy.

00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:24.601
To Dad, it seems my brother is
the only child he can be proud of.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.000
That was the reason I decided to run for
the student council presidency.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.598
I wanted to show my father
that I can be his pride and joy, too.

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:36.699
One, two...

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.601
For the student president election,

00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:43.917
please present your student ID
in order to vote.

00:02:43.948 --> 00:02:44.948
Look.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.457
We’re still way behind Mai.

00:02:50.053 --> 00:02:51.303
- We’re in the lead.
- Really?

00:02:51.324 --> 00:02:52.324
Yeah!

00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:55.770
Whoo!

00:02:57.417 --> 00:02:59.198
Does that mean we’re losing?

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.330
DAD: HOW IS THE ELECTION GOING?

00:03:07.986 --> 00:03:08.986
It’s a shame.

00:03:10.742 --> 00:03:12.650
I think he’s looking at us.

00:03:13.228 --> 00:03:14.604
I’m going to the restroom.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.130
MY VOTES ARE BEHIND. I’M NOT SURE I’D WIN.

00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:43.951
I voted for you, Mamay.

00:04:02.192 --> 00:04:04.512
It might seem like you’re falling behind
on the scoreboard,

00:04:04.791 --> 00:04:07.401
but I believe you’ll turn the table
and win at the end.

00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:11.900
Thank you, Kaen.

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:16.442
But…

00:04:18.927 --> 00:04:21.099
I doubt I’ll ever be
the student president.

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:27.502
Maybe I really am incompetent,
just like my dad says I am.

00:04:28.065 --> 00:04:29.376
You can’t give up now, Mamay.

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:30.797
There’s still time.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.302
Anything is possible.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.577
In the system, only 68%
of students have voted.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.503
There are still the other 32%.

00:04:39.577 --> 00:04:41.000
They might vote for you.

00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:47.976
Did you write the voting software, Kaen?

00:04:48.576 --> 00:04:49.202
Yes.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.712
Do you want to see the real-time result?

00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:51.903
I can show you that.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.490
Kaen.

00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:08.297
Will you help me?

00:06:07.514 --> 00:06:08.598
What the hell did you do?

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.700
I’m just trying to win.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.630
Just like you all have been doing.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.270
I get it now.

00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:20.500
I think Madam President here is mad
that you rigged the election, dude.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.582
You shouldn’t have done that.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.302
Don’t you know
how dangerous this can be?

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.480
How can it be dangerous?

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.010
She’s right.

00:06:33.592 --> 00:06:35.500
Is there something you’re not telling us?

00:06:43.434 --> 00:06:44.434
No.

00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:48.176
I just feel bad for Kaen for being used.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.048
Players, place the piece in your box.

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:57.625
Let’s not argue.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.103
It won’t fix anything.

00:06:59.605 --> 00:07:00.605
Just go.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.900
Here are the results of the game:

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:55.100
The winner who has successfully built
five rows will receive two medals.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.900
Players who have successfully built
four rows will receive one medal each.

00:08:07.832 --> 00:08:08.832
I’ll take that.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.588
Players who’ve failed to build three rows
will receive a penalty.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.700
Hold on!

00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:20.502
There’s a penalty?

00:08:20.802 --> 00:08:22.470
Come on! What penalty?

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.944
You didn’t tell us anything beforehand!

00:08:23.968 --> 00:08:24.968
Hey!

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.754
What penalty?

00:08:27.847 --> 00:08:28.847
What is it!

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.180
Guys.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.598
The door is back.

00:08:36.225 --> 00:08:37.703
Does that mean the game is over?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.440
Mark, hurry up.

00:09:00.219 --> 00:09:01.500
My phone is working again.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.201
I’m keeping this thing.

00:09:30.995 --> 00:09:32.970
You come to me when you want to play.

00:09:33.223 --> 00:09:35.405
Who would want to play
when there’s a penalty?

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.198
What will happen to Kaen?

00:09:41.392 --> 00:09:43.450
Maybe the game’s gonna
send someone to kill him.

00:09:45.357 --> 00:09:47.103
Can we stop talking about this game?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.703
If there’s nothing else, I’m leaving.

00:10:26.257 --> 00:10:28.137
Maybe the game’s gonna
send someone to kill him.

00:10:45.859 --> 00:10:46.859
Kaen.

00:10:49.967 --> 00:10:50.967
Mamay.

00:10:51.619 --> 00:10:52.800
So it’s just you.

00:10:53.454 --> 00:10:54.499
What’s the matter?

00:10:56.075 --> 00:10:57.075
I…

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:02.600
I wanted to make sure you’re okay, and…

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.447
I’m really sorry about that last piece.

00:11:08.894 --> 00:11:09.946
Don’t worry about it.

00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:12.275
And…

00:11:13.558 --> 00:11:14.930
We had our agreement, didn’t we?

00:11:34.586 --> 00:11:35.801
So…

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.048
You’ve been putting up with their bullying

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.651
because of this video?

00:11:41.374 --> 00:11:42.374
I’m sorry.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.317
I didn’t want you to worry...

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.696
But of course I’ll worry...

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.080
when everyone could find out any moment
now that I rigged the election!

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:51.705
No, you don’t have to worry.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.896
I won’t let this trace back to you.

00:11:54.029 --> 00:11:57.002
Am I supposed to just keep letting
Don use this video against me?

00:12:09.817 --> 00:12:10.817
Do you think…

00:12:14.257 --> 00:12:16.706
this game really can grant wishes?

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.442
What do you mean, Mamay?

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.573
What if I wished for...

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.583
Don’s video to disappear?

00:12:28.308 --> 00:12:30.896
But before we can make that happen,

00:12:31.743 --> 00:12:33.208
I have to win this game.

00:12:37.299 --> 00:12:38.601
Will you help me, Kaen?

00:12:52.545 --> 00:12:53.601
I’m sorry.

00:12:54.293 --> 00:12:57.582
I thought I’d get four medals when I won

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.430
and I’d get to make a wish for
that video to disappear.

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:03.505
But I don’t have four medals.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:06.590
Don’t worry.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.198
We’ll get them in the next game.

00:13:11.425 --> 00:13:12.700
I’ll help you win.

00:13:15.146 --> 00:13:18.202
What about… the penalty?

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.177
Nothing happens so far.

00:13:20.751 --> 00:13:22.500
I think you can rest easy.

00:13:23.014 --> 00:13:24.014
Okay.

00:13:24.368 --> 00:13:27.897
But you need to keep me posted
if anything strange happens.

00:13:29.194 --> 00:13:29.802
Of course.

00:13:29.965 --> 00:13:32.201
You’ll be the first to know.

00:13:35.293 --> 00:13:36.586
You should go home.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.080
Your father must be worrying.

00:13:38.675 --> 00:13:39.675
Okay.

00:13:39.848 --> 00:13:42.245
See you at school tomorrow.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:01.552
If you approve,
I’ll have it printed by Friday.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:02.730
Hmm.

00:14:03.106 --> 00:14:04.106
Hey, Mamay.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.460
You’re late.

00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:06.770
Is it busy at school?

00:14:07.429 --> 00:14:08.429
Uhh…

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:09.937
I…

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.650
The chauffeur told me
he couldn’t contact you for a while.

00:14:14.023 --> 00:14:16.700
Are you sure you’ve been busy
with school work?

00:14:20.179 --> 00:14:21.179
Yes.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.597
Think of your old man a little.

00:14:26.325 --> 00:14:27.325
Do you understand?

00:14:28.831 --> 00:14:29.831
Yes.

00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:33.831
It’s almost time we meet up
with the Minister.

00:14:33.854 --> 00:14:34.937
Let’s go.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.065
- And here I was voting for Mai.
- Right.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.200
Kaen seems like such a proper student.

00:15:04.277 --> 00:15:05.450
I can’t believe he did it.

00:15:05.597 --> 00:15:06.597
Why would he do it?

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.398
Mai didn’t deserve this.

00:15:10.536 --> 00:15:11.536
I know.

00:15:11.634 --> 00:15:12.699
Did you see this?

00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:14.642
Mamay is here.

00:15:19.674 --> 00:15:21.605
Mamay, did you know anything about this?

00:15:23.028 --> 00:15:24.028
About what?

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.202
People are saying Kaen rigged the system
to make sure Mai lost the election.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.346
We didn’t believe it at first.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.740
But there’s this video clip.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:34.007
Look.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.040
Will you admit it now that
you rigged the election?

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.697
I rigged the election.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.697
I rigged the system so Mai lost.

00:15:47.671 --> 00:15:49.351
You don’t know anything
about this, do you?

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.998
I knew you’d never do anything like this.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.900
But why would Kaen do it?

00:16:02.632 --> 00:16:03.900
Maybe Kaen hates Mai?

00:16:04.728 --> 00:16:06.450
But he still shouldn’t have done that.

00:16:06.631 --> 00:16:09.699
This will only reflect badly on Mamay.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.300
Someone might think Mamay
told Kaen to rig the election, right?

00:16:15.105 --> 00:16:15.648
Yeah.

00:16:15.986 --> 00:16:18.266
If the teachers saw this,
we might even have a reelection.

00:16:46.918 --> 00:16:48.416
Kaen, there you are.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.620
I was worried sick
when you didn’t answer my call.

00:16:51.118 --> 00:16:52.899
Did you see the video?

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.435
Don’t tell me…

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.940
Isn’t this the project you’ve been
working on for the expo in Korea?

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.982
How did it get burnt?
Has there been a short circuit?

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.110
It can’t be.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.395
If there’s been a short circuit,

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.630
everything else in the room
must catch fire as well.

00:17:35.866 --> 00:17:37.702
But only my project is burnt down.

00:17:39.438 --> 00:17:40.496
You’re right.

00:17:40.743 --> 00:17:43.805
Without this project, I have nothing
for the expo in Korea.

00:17:44.007 --> 00:17:45.807
What about my college scholarship?

00:17:45.948 --> 00:17:47.303
How did it come to this?

00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:49.065
Kaen, calm down.

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:50.900
I’ll help you.

00:17:51.085 --> 00:17:52.902
If it’s not because of a short circuit,

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.402
someone must have done this.

00:17:56.905 --> 00:17:57.905
Maybe this is…

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.850
because of the video.

00:18:11.711 --> 00:18:14.801
I rigged the system so Mai lost.

00:18:14.937 --> 00:18:15.597
I knew it.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.080
It made no sense that the votes
were in my favor but I lost.

00:18:19.487 --> 00:18:20.601
Did you do it?

00:18:22.743 --> 00:18:23.823
What are you talking about?

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.400
Kaen’s project.

00:18:25.457 --> 00:18:26.730
You burned it down, didn’t you?

00:18:27.074 --> 00:18:28.314
Kaen’s project got burned down?

00:18:28.665 --> 00:18:30.899
Karma works fast, huh?

00:18:33.665 --> 00:18:35.001
What makes you think I did it?

00:18:35.217 --> 00:18:36.179
Because you resented him for...

00:18:36.192 --> 00:18:38.299
For rigging the election?

00:18:39.402 --> 00:18:40.802
Come on. No need to be embarrassed.

00:18:41.179 --> 00:18:43.899
Everyone knows he rigged it for you.

00:18:44.985 --> 00:18:46.188
But I’ll have you know

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:48.600
I’m not one to stoop so low.

00:18:49.555 --> 00:18:50.702
But this got me thinking:

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.503
Was Kaen helping you of his own accord

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.797
or did someone ask him to?

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.198
When you think about it,
you got the most out of this, didn’t you?

00:19:05.124 --> 00:19:06.124
Am I right, Kaen?

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.680
Kaen.

00:19:13.874 --> 00:19:15.979
Did Mamay ask you to rig the election?

00:19:19.025 --> 00:19:20.540
Yo, what’s going on?

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.560
Is that true?

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.174
If this was true, she’s awful.

00:19:24.733 --> 00:19:25.970
It was suspicious.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.297
Mai was always in the lead.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.420
I voted for Mai.

00:19:37.296 --> 00:19:38.296
That’s not true!

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.780
I didn’t ask Kaen to rig
the election for me!

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.020
So you’re saying you have nothing
to do with him?

00:19:50.868 --> 00:19:51.868
Yes.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.402
I have nothing to do with Kaen.

00:19:58.794 --> 00:19:59.903
If you insist.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.420
So it’s just you I have to deal with.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.350
What are you doing?

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:07.414
This has nothing to do with you.
Stay out of it.

00:20:07.425 --> 00:20:09.065
Nobody was more affected by this than me.

00:20:09.303 --> 00:20:10.783
I get to have a little talk with him.

00:20:11.148 --> 00:20:11.802
Mamay.

00:20:12.157 --> 00:20:13.157
Mamay!

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.210
Help!

00:20:14.337 --> 00:20:15.337
Mamay!

00:20:15.774 --> 00:20:16.774
Mamay!

00:20:18.038 --> 00:20:19.678
- Mamay!
- What do you think you’re doing?

00:20:24.102 --> 00:20:25.102
Nothing, sir.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:26.977
We’re just playing.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.140
Napassorn.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.099
You’re the student president.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.005
Tell me what’s going on.

00:20:39.882 --> 00:20:40.882
Well?

00:20:42.371 --> 00:20:43.602
They’re just playing, sir.

00:20:47.918 --> 00:20:49.102
I told you.

00:20:49.491 --> 00:20:50.702
We’re just playing.

00:20:51.597 --> 00:20:54.051
If you’ll excuse me, sir.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.804
You two, follow me.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.974
This is for your project.
I’ve checked the security footage.

00:21:13.168 --> 00:21:14.168
Kaen.

00:21:16.557 --> 00:21:17.557
I…

00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:20.382
I’m sorry for what I said.

00:21:21.034 --> 00:21:22.656
I really can’t let anyone know I rigged...

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.680
That’s enough.

00:21:26.145 --> 00:21:27.145
I get it.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.899
The fire you see in the footage here
was from last night at roughly 8 p.m.

00:21:42.321 --> 00:21:44.499
I looked through the other footages,

00:21:44.942 --> 00:21:48.496
but the only camera that catches
this room is this one.

00:21:49.048 --> 00:21:52.497
It doesn’t cover other spots
where someone might enter the room.

00:21:53.358 --> 00:21:54.997
But during that time,

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.202
there was only one group of students
who were still at school last night.

00:22:06.554 --> 00:22:10.503
I don’t know what you were doing
at school so late.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.702
But if you insist the damage
to your project was someone’s doing,

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.653
then the suspect...

00:22:21.069 --> 00:22:22.702
is among you.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.099
You’re finally all here.

00:22:53.983 --> 00:22:56.502
Last night, Natdanai’s project

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:59.188
that was meant for
an international expo caught fire.

00:23:00.231 --> 00:23:01.394
How did it happen?

00:23:01.568 --> 00:23:04.896
That’s exactly why I called you here.

00:23:05.447 --> 00:23:08.296
We’re investigating this fire.

00:23:08.657 --> 00:23:11.800
Initially, we found that it wasn’t
because of a short circuit.

00:23:11.832 --> 00:23:14.905
So we reckon that it was an arson.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.777
Natdanai thinks the culprit
might be one of you.

00:23:20.428 --> 00:23:21.460
Us?

00:23:21.675 --> 00:23:26.441
You were the last group of students
at school last night.

00:23:26.875 --> 00:23:27.982
Speaking of which,

00:23:28.656 --> 00:23:30.300
what were you staying so late for?

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.048
Hey, answer me.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.300
Well?

00:23:37.877 --> 00:23:39.200
Uhh, we…

00:23:40.434 --> 00:23:41.705
We were playing a game.

00:23:42.094 --> 00:23:43.094
What game?

00:23:43.851 --> 00:23:44.480
Gambling?

00:23:44.503 --> 00:23:45.804
Oh, no, not like that, sir.

00:23:49.376 --> 00:23:50.376
Tell him.

00:23:51.517 --> 00:23:52.517
Hey.

00:24:01.285 --> 00:24:05.595
So you stayed late playing with this dice?

00:24:06.248 --> 00:24:07.297
Can I have it back?

00:24:07.557 --> 00:24:08.557
No.

00:24:08.755 --> 00:24:10.702
I must confiscate this for now.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:15.616
Once we prove that you
have nothing to do with the fire,

00:24:15.637 --> 00:24:16.911
I’ll give it back to you.

00:24:17.976 --> 00:24:19.299
Come on, Teach!

00:24:24.714 --> 00:24:26.800
Why the hell did you
give him the dice, dude?

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.700
What would you have me do?

00:24:29.354 --> 00:24:31.158
Ugh. Damn it.

00:24:32.911 --> 00:24:36.702
If you were to rebuild it, by the time
you write up the coding and everything,

00:24:37.019 --> 00:24:38.407
it would be too late for the expo.

00:24:39.008 --> 00:24:43.000
I think it’s best that I ask them to send
the first runner-up team in our place.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.197
What about my college scholarship?

00:24:48.765 --> 00:24:49.765
I’m sorry.

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.090
Just hack into the university’s system
and put your name on the list.

00:24:59.678 --> 00:25:01.798
Wouldn’t be harder than rigging
an election, would it?

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.896
- You did it, didn’t you!
- Hey, hey!

00:25:07.287 --> 00:25:07.894
Huh?

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.690
What the hell you think you’re doing?

00:25:09.949 --> 00:25:10.949
Kaen!

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:12.450
Kaen, are you alright?

00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:17.795
I know you posted that video clip.

00:25:18.429 --> 00:25:20.600
But why the hell did you have to
burn my project down?

00:25:20.888 --> 00:25:22.002
I did post the video.

00:25:22.997 --> 00:25:24.500
But I didn’t ruin your project.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:27.180
He was with me all night.
How could he have burned it?

00:25:27.247 --> 00:25:28.802
If it’s not you, then who did it?

00:25:31.197 --> 00:25:32.601
The penalty.

00:25:37.552 --> 00:25:40.700
The teacher said it wasn't
a short circuit,

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.099
and there was no trace of anyone
entering the room.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:47.069
That means it’s the penalty
from the game, doesn’t it?

00:25:52.358 --> 00:25:53.998
There’s something
I haven’t told you guys.

00:25:55.677 --> 00:25:57.997
When we were in the game,
Aom said something strange to me.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:01.899
Guys. The door is back.

00:26:02.054 --> 00:26:03.054
Mark, hurry up.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.102
Aom, thank you for not bidding
for that piece.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.402
I just felt bad for you
if you were to fail this game.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.400
Because if you don’t complete it,

00:26:19.251 --> 00:26:20.700
it won’t end here in the game.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.060
What do you mean?

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:24.710
I don’t think you want to know that.

00:26:25.922 --> 00:26:26.922
Let’s just say…

00:26:27.822 --> 00:26:29.601
You owe me once.

00:26:35.288 --> 00:26:36.497
“It won’t end in the game”?

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.499
Was she talking about the penalty?

00:26:39.694 --> 00:26:40.694
I don’t know.

00:26:41.662 --> 00:26:43.198
But it sounds possible.

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:47.302
Maybe Kaen’s project caught fire
as a punishment for losing the game.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.460
Nonsense.

00:26:48.878 --> 00:26:50.576
How could it be a punishment
from the game?

00:26:51.761 --> 00:26:53.503
I think it’s someone’s doing.

00:26:54.268 --> 00:26:56.527
And no one’s more suspicious
than you, Don.

00:26:56.869 --> 00:26:59.305
You seem to want it
to be my fault so badly.

00:26:59.758 --> 00:27:02.600
How come you don’t believe for a second
that it’s the game’s punishment?

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.370
Is it because you’re afraid everyone
will realize it’s all because of you?

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.011
If you didn’t steal
that last piece from Kaen,

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.010
his project wouldn’t have
burned down now, would it?

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.120
I don’t think we should
jump to any conclusion.

00:27:21.678 --> 00:27:24.410
We still don’t know what caused the fire.

00:27:25.016 --> 00:27:26.376
If it really was the game’s doing,

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.850
Mamay didn’t know
what the punishment would be.

00:27:30.714 --> 00:27:31.714
He’s right.

00:27:32.125 --> 00:27:33.930
Mamay didn’t mean for this
to happen to Kaen.

00:27:41.002 --> 00:27:41.804
You know what?

00:27:41.982 --> 00:27:44.540
The person you’re defending
is the worst of all.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.451
She wasn’t just the reason
Kaen’s project got ruined,

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:54.008
but she also told Kaen
to rig the election.

00:28:15.625 --> 00:28:16.653
I’m sorry.

00:28:17.194 --> 00:28:20.500
I thought I’d get four medals when I won

00:28:20.859 --> 00:28:23.019
and I’d get to make a wish for
that video to disappear.

00:28:23.237 --> 00:28:24.697
But I don’t have four medals.

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:26.737
Don’t worry.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.248
We’ll get them in the next game.

00:28:30.579 --> 00:28:31.795
I’ll help you win.

00:28:32.902 --> 00:28:34.905
I heard everything last night.

00:28:35.231 --> 00:28:39.208
You took the last piece because
you wanted to make a wish, didn’t you?

00:28:43.951 --> 00:28:45.250
So I posted that video.

00:28:48.887 --> 00:28:50.300
Deny it if it’s not true, Kaen.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.851
Defend her the way you always do.

00:28:53.875 --> 00:28:55.102
Take the fall for her.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.454
If you’re such a fool,
go ahead and deny it.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.020
Kaen.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.251
Kaen.

00:29:13.407 --> 00:29:14.653
Kaen, hear me out.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.162
I’ll help you find the person
who burned down your project.

00:29:17.188 --> 00:29:18.370
I still believe it’s Don who did i...

00:29:18.388 --> 00:29:19.400
Stop it already!

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.002
Whether it’s the game or otherwise,

00:29:24.645 --> 00:29:26.299
it all started with you, Mamay!

00:29:27.066 --> 00:29:29.001
It’s all because I helped you
rig the election.

00:29:30.807 --> 00:29:31.361
Kaen.

00:29:31.517 --> 00:29:33.296
How can you say that?

00:29:33.767 --> 00:29:35.296
I really want to help you.

00:29:36.475 --> 00:29:39.500
In exchange for keeping quiet about you?

00:29:39.703 --> 00:29:40.379
Kaen.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.561
I used to think you were a good person,

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.496
that you were different.

00:29:46.813 --> 00:29:48.053
But that’s not the case, is it?

00:29:52.748 --> 00:29:56.004
What you’re doing is worse than
what those bullies do.

00:30:05.004 --> 00:30:06.402
Don’t worry, Mamay.

00:30:07.632 --> 00:30:10.499
Don’s video won’t trace back to you.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.702
But after this, can you just, please,

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.103
leave me alone?

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:28.445
I don’t want to be disappointed or hurt
because of you again.

00:30:57.791 --> 00:30:58.791
Mamay.

00:30:59.417 --> 00:31:00.608
I need to talk to you.

00:31:11.032 --> 00:31:12.200
What’s the matter?

00:31:13.712 --> 00:31:16.303
I saw that video of someone’s
rigging your election.

00:31:17.194 --> 00:31:18.853
One of the parents sent it to me.

00:31:19.607 --> 00:31:21.497
What exactly happened?

00:31:22.337 --> 00:31:25.303
Is any of what everyone’s saying true?

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.080
It is true.

00:31:32.949 --> 00:31:35.702
I won the election because
I asked my friend to rig it for me.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.697
I’m not competent enough to be
a student council president.

00:31:41.754 --> 00:31:43.897
Who else knows about this?

00:31:45.048 --> 00:31:46.697
A few other people.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:52.601
Do any of them have any evidence
that would point you out?

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.040
My friend in the video promises
to take responsibility for everything.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.600
That’s good.

00:32:08.299 --> 00:32:09.800
When there is no proof,

00:32:11.134 --> 00:32:12.814
all you have to do is deny the allegation.

00:32:14.469 --> 00:32:16.800
Just say it was all your friend’s doing.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.602
As for other matters at school,

00:32:19.813 --> 00:32:21.205
I’ll help you.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.440
But…

00:32:24.675 --> 00:32:28.102
That means I’ll have to let
my friend take all the blame.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.143
I started it!

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:31.170
What of it?

00:32:32.924 --> 00:32:35.601
Your friend volunteered, didn’t he?

00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:36.900
Let him take the fall.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.847
From now on, just keep a low profile,

00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:45.000
let the scandal die down on its own.

00:32:45.484 --> 00:32:49.105
Don’t stir suspicion
that would lead to you.

00:32:50.037 --> 00:32:52.345
It will only ruin my name.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.800
Understood?

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.690
CHEAT / FAKE!

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.969
ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF?
YOU’RE A CHEAT.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.329
AN (UN)ETHICAL (FAKE) LEADER

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.290
(NOT) FOR OUR SCHOOL.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.500
Wait here.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.001
I’ll go get the form.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.600
Are you sure about this?

00:33:56.226 --> 00:33:59.099
Do you really want to resign
as the student president?

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.546
Yes, I am.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.102
I must notify your father about this.

00:34:11.976 --> 00:34:12.976
Yes.

00:34:15.284 --> 00:34:16.496
What the hell did you do?

00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:18.597
I told you to keep quiet.

00:34:18.982 --> 00:34:22.804
Did it ever occur to you that
my reputation would be in shambles

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.524
if words get out that a child of mine
rigged a student election?

00:34:24.548 --> 00:34:26.001
You really are useless.

00:34:26.303 --> 00:34:28.583
Blame it on my fortune to have
a stupid daughter like you.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:37.567
Why did you decide to resign?

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.703
I happened to overhear your conversation
with the Headmaster.

00:34:49.825 --> 00:34:50.825
You know…

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:57.330
The only reason I signed up for the
election in the first place was because

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.801
I wanted my father to love and…

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.201
approve of me, even just a little.

00:35:07.765 --> 00:35:09.297
I never thought...

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.580
it would cost me the only person
who really loves me.

00:35:21.648 --> 00:35:23.290
Everything that happened to Kaen

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.496
was all my fault.

00:35:34.789 --> 00:35:36.699
I shouldn’t have done that to him.

00:35:41.568 --> 00:35:42.568
Mamay.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:45.954
I want to tell you something.

00:35:48.731 --> 00:35:51.131
It’s about that video of me and the friend
who was in a coma.

00:35:54.797 --> 00:35:56.096
That wasn’t what happened.

00:36:02.368 --> 00:36:03.434
What the hell did you do?

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.854
We’re in the same team!

00:36:07.047 --> 00:36:08.047
Same team?

00:36:09.128 --> 00:36:11.404
You? Care about our team?

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:16.951
Don’t you know no one in our team
wants you there?

00:36:18.751 --> 00:36:21.201
There’s no place for you here.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.860
Atom, you jerk!

00:36:30.931 --> 00:36:31.931
Atom, I’m sorry.

00:36:32.385 --> 00:36:33.385
I’m sorry.

00:36:34.189 --> 00:36:34.706
Atom.

00:36:34.872 --> 00:36:35.872
Atom!

00:36:40.805 --> 00:36:41.805
Hey, Atom!

00:36:43.555 --> 00:36:44.291
What’s going on?

00:36:44.305 --> 00:36:45.305
Atom!

00:36:46.885 --> 00:36:47.395
Atom!

00:36:47.463 --> 00:36:48.299
- Atom!
- Atom!

00:36:48.471 --> 00:36:49.899
Crap! What happened?

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:50.543
Atom!

00:36:50.785 --> 00:36:51.506
Atom!

00:36:51.554 --> 00:36:52.096
Atom!

00:36:52.308 --> 00:36:53.389
Call the teachers!

00:36:53.847 --> 00:36:54.974
Why the hell did you have to do this?

00:36:54.998 --> 00:36:56.103
How could you?

00:36:56.368 --> 00:36:56.985
Atom!

00:36:57.376 --> 00:36:58.496
He’s bleeding.

00:36:58.934 --> 00:36:59.491
Atom!

00:36:59.511 --> 00:37:00.700
Call an ambulance.

00:37:00.872 --> 00:37:01.872
Right now.

00:37:03.031 --> 00:37:06.500
Why didn’t you tell anyone?

00:37:06.859 --> 00:37:08.700
Why did you put up with
being the bad guy?

00:37:09.805 --> 00:37:11.202
Who would believe me?

00:37:12.562 --> 00:37:14.500
The video speaks for itself.

00:37:15.297 --> 00:37:17.697
Whatever I say, it would be just like
making excuses, right?

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.740
You’re right.

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.200
I’m not saying I didn’t do anything wrong.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.103
I did resort to violence.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:33.310
And that was the beginning of it.

00:37:36.383 --> 00:37:39.797
Why are you telling me this now?

00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:46.302
Because I understand how difficult it is
to admit your own mistakes.

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:51.200
No one wants to accept the painful truth.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.002
I admire your decision.

00:37:56.214 --> 00:37:57.750
You’re brave enough to accept
the consequences of your actions,

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.597
despite whatever anyone says.

00:38:08.482 --> 00:38:13.200
So you don’t have to try so hard
to be liked by everyone anymore.

00:38:15.035 --> 00:38:16.401
You can just be yourself.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.106
Thank you for talking to me.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:30.500
I feel so much better now.

00:38:31.568 --> 00:38:32.568
It’s alright.

00:38:33.063 --> 00:38:36.800
Besides you, there’s not many people
who talk to me anyway.

00:38:38.345 --> 00:38:41.004
You can talk to me about
anything from now on.

00:38:41.355 --> 00:38:42.402
I’ll be happy to help.

00:38:42.712 --> 00:38:45.576
Well, not as the
student president, though.

00:38:46.263 --> 00:38:47.263
Hmm…

00:38:49.651 --> 00:38:51.503
I’m actually looking into the game.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.500
The game?

00:38:53.986 --> 00:38:54.986
Yes.

00:38:55.549 --> 00:38:57.330
I went to the laboratory.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.200
I didn’t find anything that could be
the cause of the fire.

00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:06.200
So I’m thinking there’s a chance
that it could be the game’s doing.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.850
I want to learn more about it.

00:39:10.631 --> 00:39:11.802
Let me help.

00:39:12.001 --> 00:39:14.297
If it really was the game’s punishment,

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:16.500
then it was all my fault.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.499
I want to at least make up
for my mistakes.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.860
Of course.

00:39:24.936 --> 00:39:26.004
Should we…

00:39:27.302 --> 00:39:29.597
start where the dice was found?

00:39:42.737 --> 00:39:43.737
Jerk!

00:39:52.186 --> 00:39:53.601
This is where I first found it.

00:40:00.334 --> 00:40:01.502
The Board Game Club.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.770
TEN-SIDED DICE

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.780
THE SYMBOL ON THE DICE

00:40:23.893 --> 00:40:24.893
Look.

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:26.950
It’s exactly like the game we played.

00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:33.629
That means this dice really came from
the Board Game Club.

00:40:33.779 --> 00:40:36.499
But our school never has a club like that.

00:40:36.977 --> 00:40:41.002
If there ever was,
it must be before I got into this school.

00:40:45.917 --> 00:40:47.404
The Year 1995.

00:40:48.207 --> 00:40:50.503
Maybe there was this club 30 years ago.

00:40:58.503 --> 00:40:59.503
Look.

00:41:00.725 --> 00:41:01.725
Who is…

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.380
Panyada?

00:41:05.623 --> 00:41:07.595
She could be a club member.

00:41:09.296 --> 00:41:10.801
If we find Panyada,

00:41:11.281 --> 00:41:12.896
we might know more about this dice.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.050
PANYADA

00:41:20.645 --> 00:41:21.645
Here.

00:41:23.139 --> 00:41:24.840
The school yearbooks.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.250
There’s information about
each year’s students.

00:41:27.794 --> 00:41:31.303
In the log book,
Panyada noted the year as 1995.

00:41:31.782 --> 00:41:37.602
She could be a student here
since maybe 1993, couldn’t she?

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:41.170
Let’s look her up.

00:42:08.945 --> 00:42:11.000
We looked through everything.

00:42:11.472 --> 00:42:14.103
How come there’s nothing on anyone
with the name Panyada?

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.850
1996/1994

00:42:47.256 --> 00:42:48.400
What’s wrong, Samut?

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:54.201
These yearbooks…

00:42:54.429 --> 00:42:55.601
One is missing.

00:42:57.277 --> 00:42:58.320
The 1995 Yearbook.

00:42:59.054 --> 00:43:02.500
But I’m sure I took
every book on the shelf.

00:43:03.162 --> 00:43:06.000
Maybe someone borrowed it
from the library?

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.680
What are you doing?

00:43:10.426 --> 00:43:12.866
What else would I be doing in a library
but looking for books?

00:43:16.379 --> 00:43:17.900
Samut? Where are you going?

00:43:39.044 --> 00:43:40.044
What are you doing?

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:45.810
Aom.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:10.660
MISS PANYADA PALANUDECH

00:44:15.752 --> 00:44:18.097
Mamay and I have been researching
this dice game.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.152
Don’t tell me you want to play it again.

00:44:20.628 --> 00:44:21.628
We do.

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.589
Welcome, all eight players, to Djehuty.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.597
Are we in a hotel?

00:44:29.986 --> 00:44:31.600
The Pilgrimage.

00:44:31.675 --> 00:44:34.499
Players are assigned as pilgrims,

00:44:34.573 --> 00:44:36.202
heading toward the Gate of Heaven.

00:44:36.543 --> 00:44:37.543
There are dice here.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.990
What are they for?

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:40.598
Are you guys choosing that room?

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:41.730
Good luck with that.

[Episode 17]

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.260
Dr. Meng, be careful.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.980
Give me the medicine box.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.820
How is Mr. Lee?

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.180
Mr. Lee is not looking optimistic.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.460
He's taken all the medicine he should,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.740
but is still complaining of a headache.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.660
Please check on him.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.980
Alright.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.100
Here, this way, please.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.980
Please.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.220
She's here.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.100
Dr. Meng.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.660
Yin.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.100
Let's not go upstairs.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.820
Just let Charlie assist Dr. Meng.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.340
Watch your step, slowly.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.540
Right, let's not
disturb their treatment.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.380
Right side, right side.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.500
Let's rest a bit more.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.220
Alright.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.100
Don't worry, the doctor is here.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.980
How could he suddenly
be in so much pain?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.100
Please examine

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.540
what's going on with Mr. Lee.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.540
Mr. Lee.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.820
We meet again.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.380
Oh my god!

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.500
Oh my god!

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.980
Meng Jie, I'm sorry

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.260
to call you over so late.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.260
Actually, I need your help.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.940
Why are there so many people here?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.410
What happened?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.380
So many people in this room.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.340
It's lively.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.570
Director Liang, what's going on?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.380
Inspector Li.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.100
It's getting late.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.260
Why don't you go back first?

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.260
I still have things to attend to here.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.540
No rush, Mrs. Liang.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.500
Let me see if I can
help you with anything.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.540
Charlie.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.820
My lifesaver.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.500
You came without a word.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.660
I would've prepared
wine and food for you.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.980
Long time no see,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.540
Charlie.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.380
Madam.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.500
Earlier, Mr. Lee and I were taken
by the Anti-Traitor Squad.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.820
It was all thanks to Inspector Li

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.380
that we were rescued.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.540
This is

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.660
the one Mr. Lee often mentioned to you,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.980
his lifesaver, Li Boyao,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.980
Inspector Li.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.580
You flatter me.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.340
So you are Inspector Li.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.220
Joseph mentioned things

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.100
from the past to me.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.020
Thank you for saving his life.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.100
It's rare that Mr. Lee still remembers.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.780
I thought after he became successful,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.980
he would have forgotten me.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.780
I know you, Ms. Xian.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.900
The big star.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.220
I've seen...

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.700
Charlie.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.900
Madam.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.900
How is Joseph?

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.780
Madam, please don't worry.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.340
Fortunately,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.340
Dr. Meng arrived in time

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.340
and stabilized Mr. Lee's condition.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.980
I also feared you would
be overly worried,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.340
so I came downstairs
to tell you the good news.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.100
He's fine now.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.980
Thank goodness.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.980
Thank goodness.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.020
It's good that he's fine.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.460
Biyun, the doctor said he's fine.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.460
Don't worry anymore.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.460
Since Mr. Lee is fine now,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.700
I'm relieved.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.220
Then we'll head back first.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.100
All esteemed experts, please stay.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.460
Today,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.460
I specially brought cigarettes

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.580
for you to try.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.460
These are London-produced Marlboros.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.340
Authentic British goods.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.700
Ever since the war started,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.980
these cigarettes in Shanghai

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.340
are practically out of stock.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.460
I went to great lengths

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.780
to get a batch.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.580
Mr. Expert,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.340
please try one.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.980
Try one.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.340
It's not easy to smoke

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.580
this kind of cigarette now.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.980
You can't buy it even with money.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.220
Come, you all try it.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.980
As the saying goes,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.460
a man who doesn't smoke
lives a pointless life,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.220
and a woman who doesn't smoke
wastes her time on earth.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.980
Isn't that right?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.780
Everyone try it.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.580
Come, come on.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.700
Divide them up.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.460
This tobacco is so fragrant.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.900
If all the experts' wives

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.100
think my cigarettes are good,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.460
out of respect for Director Liang,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.900
I'll give you the wholesale price
for five cartons or more.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.700
Here, try it.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.700
I don't smoke.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.980
You don't smoke?

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.220
It's alright.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.700
Even if you don't smoke, it's fine.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.460
I have other foreign goods here.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.020
You could say I have all kinds of stuff.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.460
Like rayon, fabrics, white sugar,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.340
stockings, lipstick, perfume,
canned goods, chocolate,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.100
Zippo lighters,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.580
and cigars, red wine, whiskey.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.700
I have everything.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.340
Medical supplies, guns,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.900
and the blissful opium
that makes you happy.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.580
If I could go out, I'd want a swimsuit.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.660
Mrs. Liang, this is yours.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.140
That's enough.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.660
Know your place, alright?

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.700
There's one more pack.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.140
Charlie.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:01.250
For you.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.610
Thank you, Inspector Li.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.290
Wait a minute.

The one hiding in my
brother-in-law's room

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.050
was you, wasn't it?

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.290
One gold bar.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.460
Help me with something.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.900
Director Liang would like to try it?

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.380
How is it?

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.260
The cigarette is good.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.860
Inspector Li,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.860
it's getting late.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.860
You should go.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.860
Everyone saw it, right?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.380
Director Liang says
this cigarette is good.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:49.860
Well then,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.740
I won't disturb you all any longer.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.690
To be honest,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:53.740

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.220

"The Emperor and the Assassin".

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.380
It's good.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.460
Then I'll take my leave now.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.860
I wish everybody have a wonderful day.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.260
See you next time.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.690
Inspector Li.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:06.860
I'll see you out.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:07.860
Okay.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:09.260
Please.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:12.980
What's wrong with Director Lee?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.100
Is he alright?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.620
He's no longer in serious condition.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.620
Everyone, please clear the way.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.460

Inspector Li, turn right outside.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.740
Okay, bye-bye.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.740
Take care, Inspector.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.620
Farewell.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.100
Farewell.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.220
Take care, Inspector Li.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.980
Take care, Inspector Li.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.340
Inspector Li.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.500
I'll see you out.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.620
Goodbye.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.690
Inspector Li, turn right outside.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:57.260
Okay.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.980
This guy.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.500
His hands are really fast.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.140
Charlie.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.860
Madam.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.260
What else did Dr. Meng say?

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.620
Dr. Meng said

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.980
Mr. Lee's condition
is temporarily under control.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.740
She wants to stay
and monitor him for the night

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.860
and leave after his condition
is completely stable.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.020
Dr. Meng is indeed thoughtful.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.340
With her here,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.140
I'm at ease.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.020
Yes.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.140
Since Joseph is fine now,

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.620
everyone go back to rest.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.020
I feel bad about

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.620
troubling you all so late.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.620
Mrs. Lee, you're too kind.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.140
We are all neighbors.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.740
A close neighbor is better
than a distant relative.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.220
If you need anything, just say the word.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.620
I thank everyone on Joseph's behalf.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.260
Thank you, Director Liang.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.860
Alright, everyone.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.620
Since Director Lee
is no longer in serious condition,

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.380
and has Dr. Meng Jie by his side,

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.380
you should go back to rest early.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.890
Alright then, farewell for now.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:41.620
Farewell.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.740
He's fine.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.890
Alright, Biyun.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:44.620
I'm leaving too.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.260
Alright.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.620
Director Liang, you

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.380
have any further instructions?

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.140
If Director Lee has any further issues,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.620
you can inform me in advance.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.740
Rules are rigid,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.140
but people are flexible.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.890
Please rest assured, Director Liang.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.380
If Mr. Lee has
any matters in the future,

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.890
I will report to you immediately.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.620
Alright, Liang.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.380
Go home now.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.890
Take care, Director Liang.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:38.740
Take care, Director Liang.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.340
Close the door.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.340
Thank you.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.340
Thanks.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.260
Why is he here?

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.340
He came to deliver
a message for Luo Han.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.260
Him?

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.140
Yes.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.620
Don't you forget

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.740
he knows everything.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.740
He won't betray us, will he?

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.020
No, he won't.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.340
If he betrays us,

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.260
he won't get a single penny
from the Japanese.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.100
But if he keeps us,

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.500
it's like having a cash cow.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.020
I haven't even thanked you
for last time.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.620
And tonight I've troubled you again.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.260
You're welcome.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.140
As long as I can help Shixian,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.380
you can find me anytime.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.380
Hearts

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:56.980
as

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.140
bait.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.020
As.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.500
Hearts.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:19.740
Bait.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.620
Hearts as bait.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.740
Use hearts as bait.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.140
What does that mean?

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.100
The bureau decided

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.890
to use the Hearts Code as bait

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.890
and continue sending messages
to lure the enemy.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.340
So that means

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.380
we can decipher it now?

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:42.890
Yes.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.500
That's great.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.500
Meng Jie.

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:07.740
Thank you so much today.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.850
But I have another request.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.900
Shixian,

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.500
you don't have to be so formal with me.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.610
Just tell me directly what you need.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:19.900
Alright.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.900
Is it convenient for you

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.260
to stay over at our place for the night?

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.370
This way Liang Jingyuan
will also believe

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.900
that Joseph Lee is truly ill.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:29.500
You can leave tomorrow morning.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:30.260
Is that okay?

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.610
Alright.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.330
But I need to call home.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.330
Thank you.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.610
One gold bar?

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.370
Three

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:07.370
every month.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.770
You'll pay me for a year.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:11.900
Are you crazy?

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.130
What kind of revolution
are you fighting without money?

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.900
Get out of the car.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.370
Get out of the car.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.130
What are you doing?

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.660
In the 26th year of the ROC,

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.420
Director Dai personally
awarded me this medal.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.370
It hasn't left me since then.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.660
It's more important than my life.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.610
You take it.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:47.290
We can discuss about the money.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.770
Can your useless junk

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.370
even melt into an ounce of gold?

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.900
What kind of trash it is.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.050
You want me to risk my life
for you for this?

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.130
Take it away quickly.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.050
Take it.

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.130
As long as you get my message in,

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.130
I'll find a way

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.130
to gather enough money
as soon as possible

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.610
to redeem my medal.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.900
I'll keep my word.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:03.050
I've noticed that people
in your line of work

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.980
are all quite good at acting.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.090
Those two clowns tonight

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.220
made quite a ruckus.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.980
My heart was pounding inside.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.090
But Charlie didn't even bat an eyelid.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:18.290
It was amazing.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.260
More exciting than
"The Emperor and the Assassin".

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.290
If you people

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.460
use your intelligence

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.020
to make money,

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.980
you'd be rolling in it.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.570
Why bother with revolution?

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.220
What exactly is going on inside?

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.610
That little punk

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.980
who's pretending to be Joseph Lee

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.290
used the excuse of being sick

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.570
and threw the entire Sanyangli

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.330
into utter chaos.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.050
Liang Jingyuan even invited a doctor

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.460
to examine him.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.980
It was at this critical moment

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.530
that I successfully passed
the message to Charlie.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.260
Come here.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:01.530
I need to tell you something.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.530
What surprised me the most tonight

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.810
was that this little punk

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.220
is actually keeping
a big star, Xian Biyun.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:18.850
You know Xian Biyun?

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.700
The big star.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.460
How does that even make sense?

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.900
This is the intelligence
Gu Yangshan asked me to bring to you.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.290
Why did you just take it?

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.940
We're doing business here, friend.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.420
You told me before

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.660
to send messages inside.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.370
Now I'm bringing intelligence
out for you.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.090
For friendship's sake,

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.700
I'll charge you three more
gold bars a month.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.610
That's a total of
six gold bars per month

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:57.940
for one year.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.980
Time was short,
I couldn't gather that much.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.770
I still owe you four gold bars.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.020
Give me a few more days.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.290
I've come to realize

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.050
you're really dishonest.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.180
I'm giving you one last chance.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:31.700
Just three days.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:32.770
Okay.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:35.810
I promise you.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.700
Working with you

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.770
is very unpleasant.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.600
[Enemy wants to break Hearts]

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.260
Dr. Meng, thank you for last night.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.460
Once Joseph recovers,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.220
we will definitely visit you
to express our gratitude.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:28.530
Right.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:30.940
Great kindness
needs no verbal thanks.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.770
If there's ever a time you need my help,

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.530
just tell me.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.940
Mr. Lee, Ms. Xian.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.940
You don't have to be so polite.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.570
Treating patients

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.290
is a doctor's duty.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.220
Also,

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.290
Mr. Lee's condition is not very stable.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.770
He needs regular check-ups.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.940
If you need anything, just call me.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:52.770
Alright.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.020
Charlie, this is my home phone number.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.290
If you can't find me at the hospital,

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:11.460
call this number.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.420
Alright.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.420
I'll be going now.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.020
Thank you, Dr. Meng.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.770
Thank you.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.740
Let's go.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.500
This day

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.020
was so unsettling.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:02.530
What are you doing?

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.530
What's your hurry?

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.290
Slow down.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.290
Slow down, slow down.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.460
What's the rush?

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:19.500
Wait for me.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:31.050
Here.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.500
What's this?

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.530
The Hearts Code.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.290
You deciphered it all so quickly?

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.940
Actually, after returning
to Shanghai BIS,

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.290
I've been using the Hearts Code

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:44.570
to communicate with my superiors.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:46.940
I also participated
in its latest calculations.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.530
This is all the information I know.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.460
I've already organized it overnight.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.570
But there's still a part

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.460
I need to decipher the code
based on the existing intelligence.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.740
I'll give it to you later.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.220
This

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.220
is the ten ciphers
Liang Jingyuan gave us last time.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.460
I've deciphered them too.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.770
Tomorrow you just need
to hand this book

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:05.810
to him.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.530
But you still need to remember

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.290
every word of the Hearts Code

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.020
in case anything happens
tomorrow unexpectedly.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.940
I don't think we need
to wait until tomorrow.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.460
I can memorize it all tonight.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.770
How about this.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.460
Tonight, let's hand over
this deciphered result

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.060
to Liang Jingyuan.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.060
No, this won't do.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.980
I don't know Shen Wanqing's background.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.980
But Yi Xiuyuan

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.850
is indeed one of the top

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.060
cryptography experts in the country.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.330
If I met him before,

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.980
I would call him a senior.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.540
But you pretended to be ill last night,

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.260
tossing and turning all night,

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.850
yet you managed to do

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.330
such a massive amount of calculations

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.780
and decipher it faster than them.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.980
That's not realistic.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.370
Who am I?

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.540
Joseph Lee.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:51.810
What is Joseph Lee?

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.540
A genius.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:55.300
Sometimes the things a genius does

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.570
are just not realistic.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.090
If we actually

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.330
hand in the results

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.810
on the same day as them,

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.570
how would that show our ability?

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.330
How would we survive in Sanyangli later?

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.570
We need to give them
a display of our power.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.610
Let them see
how formidable Joseph Lee is.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:09.570
This way,

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.500
our sword can penetrate deeper.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.810
But you also need to give me some time

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.500
to decipher the remaining parts.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.570
That's true.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.060
You're right.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:29.850
If we're going to establish authority,

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.330
give me nine hours.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.060
I'll decipher the remaining content.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.780
You'll memorize all the content.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.980
No problem.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.610
However,

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.610
I still need to remind you.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.060
Never let your guard down.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:47.570
Do you know why Liang Jingyuan

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:49.810
would invite three groups of experts?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.540
He doesn't understand codes at all.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.810
The reason he invited
three groups of experts

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.780
is for balance

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.810
and mutual verification.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.330
If one group resorts to deception,

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:06.060
the other two groups
will surely discover the problem.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.330
Liang Jingyuan is a ruthless person.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.980
He cares so much about the Hearts Code,

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.540
so when he says kill,

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.570
he definitely means
more than just words.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.060
If we make one wrong move,

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.850
that will be an eternal damnation.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.060
Don't worry.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:29.980
Since I promised to help you,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.570
I definitely won't hold you back.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:33.540
I'm going to memorize it now.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:39.610
Thank you.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.260
Ms. Xian.

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:13.980
Thank you

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.500
for last night.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.060
No need for thanks.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.810
But there are some things

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.570
I think it's necessary to clarify.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.330
It's true that I came here
to ensure Ding Yi's safety.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.260
It's also true that
I have things I want to do.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:48.540
I won't ask a single question

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.980
about what you're doing.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.570
Likewise,

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:54.500
you shouldn't inquire about

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:56.500
what I do.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.500
Let's not interfere with each other.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.570
That would be best.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:05.570
Now the three of us

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.370
live under the same roof.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.780
I believe neither of us
wants to see Ding Yi

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.780
get harmed because of you or me.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:14.220
I hope

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.540
from now on, before doing anything...

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.060
We'll give each other a heads-up.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.370
Yesterday,

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.780
you made such a spectacle.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.330
Will I still be able to do business

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.330
with Inspector Li?

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.220
Business and future,
which is more important?

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.300
Don't you know?

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.740
You kept checking

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.220
that pack of cigarettes yesterday.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:56.370
Was there a problem?

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.500
Yes, there was.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.570
What problem?

00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:59.570
It was too strong.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.060
Director Liang.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.220
Has she been dropped off?

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.570
Yes, she has.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.020
Didn't expect her home
to be the Meng's Residence.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.020
The home of Meng Mingyi,
Director of the Health Agency?

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:11.500
Yes.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:13.740
Let's go.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.060
Meng Mingyi

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.330
is now a favorite of the Japanese.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.060
Director Liang,

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.060
why don't you investigate him too?

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.300
9090, this is incorrect.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.740
You need to clarify this.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.060
Calculate it again.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.810
How are you doing?

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.570
Mr. Lee, we've arrived.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:34.810
Director Lee.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.370
Director Lee.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:36.610
Hello, Director Lee.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:37.610
Hello, Director Lee.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:38.810
Hello, everyone.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.810
Please.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:40.330
Please.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:54.810
Director Lee, how are you now?

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.020
Director Lee.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.330
How is the progress?

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.060
Based on the materials
Director Liang provided,

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.650
I have already

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:14.810
deciphered everything I could.

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.330
Plus that codebook,

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.570
I think we should be able to grasp

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:22.740
most of the intelligence
from this radio station.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:28.060
You've finished such a large

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.570
amount of calculation?

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.810
It's embarrassing to say it.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.810
If my headache
hadn't recurred last night,

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.810
I think I would have been able to

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.410
decipher it all

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.740
before 9 AM this morning.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.330
I wasted a whole day of my time.

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.980
Director Liang.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.570
Hello, Director Liang.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.020
Hello, Director Liang.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:54.570
Director Lee, why are you here?

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.810
Is your health better now?

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.570
Thank you for your concern,
Director Liang.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.780
I'm here to submit
the deciphered results to you.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.570
Director Liang, please take a look.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:19.540
So fast?

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.090
As researchers of mathematics,

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.500
the most important thing

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.570
is rigor.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:32.690
Of course,

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.290
I can also understand

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:36.770
intelligence work
is a race against time.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:37.460
So,

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.460
I can only

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.130
present my current deciphered results

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:42.210
to everyone here.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.340
Even with half a codebook,

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.900
just the two of you

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.380
couldn't possibly complete

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:49.860
such a massive

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.460
amount of work in just two days.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.820
Yes, how could that be possible?

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:54.820
Exactly.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.610
This is absolutely impossible.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.210
This is absolutely impossible.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.090
Director Lee

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.090
just recovered from the headache.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.380
Do you need to rest?

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.090
It's fine.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.820
It seems everyone here
doubts me so much.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.940
Today,

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.650
I'll covert the intercepted ciphers

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.820
into plaintext

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.820
and read it out to you.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:16.380
Charlie.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:18.460
Pick a few sets of ciphers at random.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:18.820
Alright.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:29.940
Mr. Lee.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.900
2695.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:33.940
3713.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.090
1355.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:36.380
3351.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.380
3111.

Takeda colluded with the navy,

leaked Joseph Lee's code,

I still don't believe it.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.380
Do you have any secret

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.130
dealings with the BIS

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.940
and obtained other information
in advance?

Dong.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.500
Mr. Dong,

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:40.820
are you suspecting Mr. Lee

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.690
of being a mole?

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:44.340
Mr. Lee is a member
of the Tonoji family,

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.090
so are you also suspecting
that the Tonoji family

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:48.460
is endangering Sino-Japanese amity

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.460
and undermining
the Greater East Asia's co-prosperity?

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.860
Director Lee, please don't be offended.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.730
Dong cares a lot about his pride

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:58.650
and said something wrong.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:59.940
I apologize to you on his behalf.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.460
Mr. Shen, it's fine.

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.130
But he wasn't

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:08.650
entirely wrong.

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:15.770
I do have deep ties to the BIS.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:17.340
Their Anti-Traitor Squad

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.650
held me hostage for a full three days,

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:23.770
and they still want my head
every single day.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.170
But there's one thing
I'm very curious about.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:32.610
Every one of you here
is a cryptographer,

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.170
and has made outstanding contributions

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.820
to East Asia's stability.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.460
But why is it that

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.940
they don't come to kidnap you?

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.730
Is it because

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.820
your lives aren't important enough?

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.250
Director,

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.860
the BIS's radio has
transmitted another message.

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:10.420
Perfect timing.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.340
Director Liang,

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.980
you currently have the plaintext
I handed over,

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:17.940
but none of them quite trust me.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.650
That's all right.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.290
I'll decode this newly intercepted

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.340
ciphertext right here on the spot.

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:29.650
Excellent.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.730
How about this.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:33.340
Mr. Yi, Mr. Shen.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.170
You can work together.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.250
This way you can
look out for each other.

[Cipher Translation]

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:01.940
Now we're just missing
these two characters.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.460
And you can't crack them?

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:13.130
These two sets of numbers
aren't in the codebook.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.130
I'm afraid we'll have to
make a blind guess.

Chen Niguang.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.460
The last two characters should be

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:22.650
a place name.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:25.540
I don't think so.

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:29.610
A person's name?

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:32.250
With four characters?

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:35.650
In the new government,

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:37.980
is there anyone with a surname Chen
and a four-character name?

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.290
Professor Yi is right.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:41.340
There really is no official
surnamed Chen

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.730
with a four-character name
in the new government.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:49.130
Because these last three characters

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.980
are actually just two characters.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:59.460
Mr. Lee.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.540
The first set.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.730
Chinese writing is incredibly nuanced.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.340
When sending coded messages,

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.130
if you run into more complex characters,

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.130
it's pretty common to split them
into simpler parts.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.250
Like the character for "Peng" is made by
combining the parts "Peng" and "Niao".

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.820
The character for "Cun" is made by
combining the parts "Tun" and "Er".

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.340
The character for "Kui" is made by
combining the parts "Shou" and "Gui".

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.940
The character for "Yao" is made by
combining the parts "Guang" and "Di".

It's 7:30.

Director Liang,

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:09.210
why aren't you reporting
something this important?

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.820
Can you take responsibility
for your decryption?

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:19.650
It seems you still don't

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:22.770
quite trust my decryption skills.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:25.650
I can take responsibility
for my decryption results,

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.420
but can you

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:30.380
take responsibility for your doubts?

If we should split characters,

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.770
then the part we were stuck on earlier

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:42.940
actually makes sense now.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.340
That telegram from last year.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.460
Right, it kept referring to

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.650
a minister whose name
contains "Wen" and "Mu."

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.460
That should be Bao Wenyue, Minister
of Military and Political Affairs.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.730
"Yue" combines the part "Mu"
makes "Yue".

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:09.380
Mr. Yi, were you stuck on that part too?

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.210
Everything makes sense now, doesn't it?

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.340
Director Lee is really a genius.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.540
I'm flattered.

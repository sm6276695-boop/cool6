00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.380
Can you take responsibility
for your decryption?

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.740
I can take responsibility
for my decryption results,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.570
but can you

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.130
take responsibility for your doubts?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.330
Report it.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.460
Minister Chen, there's an emergency.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.660
This place has already been sealed off.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.100
Director Liang has arrived.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.010
Director Liang.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.570
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.060
Thanks to the great assistance
of the three experts,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.100
we were able to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.540
avoid a disaster.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.060
Based on our decryption result,
the response team

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.940
found a bomb

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.060
at the New Asia Hotel,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.820
and successfully stopped
the BIS terrorists' operation.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.100
The three experts here
deserve plenty of credit.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.540
I

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.500
will definitely recommend you

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.940
to the new government for commendation.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.660
Of course,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.980
Director Lee, you will
be credited the most.

[Sanyangli]

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.340
I've already reported

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.380
the situation at the Shanghai Bureau
to Secretary Mao.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.060
However, Cao Yuanzhong

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.540
is somewhat closely connected
to the Chairman's wife.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.340
Even Mr. Dai can't touch him.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.100
But my senior brother said,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.380
from now on, our actions

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.380
must be completely independent
from the Shanghai Bureau.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.890
You must not take part in

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.980
any action that risks exposure.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.340
Everything should prioritize
the Sword Thrust Operation.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.660
Even if he wants me
to manage it, I won't.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.570
Why did Xian Biyun

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.100
also get involved?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.820
To survive.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.610
She was dragged in by Sasaki.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.450
The people in the concession
hated her extremely.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.340
Patriotic students
made a scene at the film set,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.100
making it impossible to shoot.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.660
With no choice left,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.260
she went in together with Ding Yi.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.410
Is she really just an actress?

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.290
Have you found anything?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.660
She's a public figure.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.380
Since her debut at 16,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.690
her experiences every year
have been very clear.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.690
Nothing suspicious found.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.380
But I'm still not at ease.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.340
She knows too much.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.730
Once something goes wrong,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.340
and we haven't reported it beforehand,

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.660
you, me,

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.540
and perhaps even your family

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.050
won't be able to get away from it.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.460
It's fine. I trust her.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.020
What?

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.140
What's going on

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.540
with Li Boyao?

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.900
I've looked into it carefully.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.700
Aside from working
at the police station,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.660
Li Boyao also draws a salary from

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.660
the Special Party Branch, BIS, C.C,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.220
Green Gang and Red Gang.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.020
He's very well-connected
in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.660
Hello.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.780
Good afternoon.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.370
You've made up your mind?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.100
So that means the money is all ready?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.700
With so many positions,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.900
he must know a lot of things.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.100
The more he knows,

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.900
the less he can be allowed to live.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.900
Jerk.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.680
Li Boyao has been executed.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.000
Also request an investigation into

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.880
the background and identity of

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.880
former leader of
Chaosheng Troupe, Xian Biyun.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.370
Turn ahead and we will reach
the Cryptography Institute.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.930
That's the most critical intelligence
agency of Wang Jingwei's regime.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.900
The people inside were all elites

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.900
personally picked by Sasaki
and Liang Jingyuan.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.700
You must not be as careless as before.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.930
Otherwise, what awaits us

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.370
is misery and death.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.700
I understand the seriousness of this.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.700
Rest assured.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.780

Hello, Director Lee.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.460
Welcome, Director Lee.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.660
They are all decryption staff
from the Decryption Section

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.780
and some are from
the Encryption Section.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.220
But the one they admire most is you.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.050
Yes.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.780
Joseph Lee's code

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.410
is already a legend
in the cryptography world.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.700
They were all thrilled
when they heard you were coming.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.700
Yes.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.700
Let me introduce.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.370
The offices of Mr. Shen,
Mr. Yi, and Mr. Ye

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.700
are all on the first floor.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.370
Yours is on the second floor.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.140
Let's move along.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.780
Please, please.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.340
Please.

Secretary Jiang.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.460
But why are Mr. Shen and Mr. Yi

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.410
not here?

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.340
Mr. Shen and Mr. Yi

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.700
were called by Director Liang
to a meeting

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.340
because of the Xige Code.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.900
Xige Code?

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.980
Why wasn't Director Lee
informed about this?

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.460
Director Liang said

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.460
that Director Lee should
focus his efforts

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.460
on cipher design,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.660
and not get distracted by this matter.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:02.980
Please.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.780
Director Lee.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.050
Hello, Director Lee.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.540
Hello, Director Lee.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.370
Hello, everyone.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.340
Hello, Director Lee.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:20.980
Please go upstairs.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.460
This is Director Liang's office.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.020
Since you are both directors,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.650
your offices are on the second floor.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.460
The others are all on the first floor.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.460
In order not to disturb your work,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.650
we specially arranged your office

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.220
at the very end.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.300
Hello, Director Lee.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.250
I am Mr. Ye's assistant, Yi Aida.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.770
Director Lee.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.610
Your office.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.700
This is your office.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.530
If you need anything, just tell me.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.100
I'll be at your service anytime.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.820
Thank you, Secretary Jiang.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.580
Thank you.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.340
Don't bother looking.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.010
There's nothing.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.100
How do you know there's nothing?

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.250
This is the intelligence hub
of the puppet government.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.610
Confidential documents from
all countries converge here.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.460
An extra pair of ears
means an extra risk of leaks.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.010
No matter how suspicious
Liang Jingyuan is,

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.770
he wouldn't install listening devices

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.730
in the Cryptography Institute's offices.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.610
Makes sense.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.850
Not bad at all.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:56.700
Smooth sailing.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.770
[Youth Film]
Yes, yes, yes.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.730
So pretty.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.770
So envious.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.130
Look at those big eyes
and the high bridge nose.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.820
So nice.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.460
So beautiful.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.060
She's simply Venus.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.730
I don't intend to lose an arm.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.610
Don't be so modest.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.060
You can manage both
the living room and the kitchen.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.980
These skills

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.220
are remarkable.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.730
If I were a man,

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.580
I would have married her long ago.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.340
I wouldn't let Joseph Lee have a chance,

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:50.980
right?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.980
Of course.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.820
Yes.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.220
Who would disagree?

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.820
Look,

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.700
this once dazzling movie star

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.100
can still make

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.340
so many things at home.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.730
Exactly.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.580
If the old experts in our institute

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.980
ate the dumplings made
by Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Liang,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.220
wouldn't they be able

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.420
to crack a few more codes?

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.340
Precisely.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.300
Exactly.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.060
I'm just an actress.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.730
I should know a bit more.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.460
These are just modest skills

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.730
not worth much on the stage.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.220
Today,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.850
I simply made some home cooking.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.820
Just pork and cabbage fillings,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.180
and pork with shepherd's purse.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.980
I don't know what flavors

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.820
you all prefer.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.460
I hope you won't mind.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.820
We don't mind.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.980
We'll eat whatever you make.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.060
It's hard to suit all tastes anyway.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.580
These are already served.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.820
Mrs. Lee,

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:40.940
let me tell you,

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.220
my husband Dong and I

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.220
are native Northeasterners.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.420
We never moved away.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.420
Next time,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.460
we'll treat you to authentic

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.730
sauerkraut dumplings.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.460
That taste

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.460
is absolutely delicious.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.850
We Shandong people also love dumplings.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.420
We Henan people mainly eat noodles.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.700
I'll treat you to Henan
stewed noodles then.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.850
Good.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.460
What about you, Mrs. Liu?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.490
Me?

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.220
I love beef with scallions
and lamb with zucchini.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.850
Judging by your accent,

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.580
you're a southerner, Mrs. Liu?

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.220
Why do you prefer northern tastes?

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.820
You don't know,

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.820
my husband

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.340
was transferred for work
to the Northeast.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.300
I lived with him there for eight years

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.580
in the SMR.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.980
I got used to the taste long ago.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.460
Oh right,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.220
Mrs. Wang moved there

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.580
around the same time we did.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.300
Her tastes are similar too.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.530
Right, Mrs. Wang?

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.340
Yes, yes.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.340
Come, give me a hand.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.020
What's wrong with you?

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.220
Why the long face?

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.890
Right now we're on the second floor,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.650
on equal footing with Liang Jingyuan,

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.100
with everyone else beneath our feet.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.340
Isn't that great?

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.860
In this Cryptography Institute,

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.500
Shen Wanqing is in charge of encryption.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.260
That means

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.770
he'll handle many pieces of intelligence
from the Special Agent Headquarters.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.650
And Yi Xiuyuan is
in charge of decryption.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.740
That means

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.220
he will know exactly
which enemy intelligence

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.140
the Special Agent Headquarters
has obtained.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.020
It seems

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.500
Liang Jingyuan has put you

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.500
in a very prominent position

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.460
as a deputy director,

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.530
but we are only responsible

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.770
for providing cipher design plans

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:23.740
and training students,

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.740
without accessing any core secrets.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.740
But I think

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.340
not having access to core secrets

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.020
might actually be a good thing.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.650
Think about it.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.980
I don't know anything.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.740
If I'm exposed to too much,

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.380
and later can't answer questions,

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.620
it's easy to blow my cover.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.770
But our purpose in coming here

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.380
is precisely to get access
to core intelligence.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.980
Just now Jiang mentioned

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.340
they're having a meeting

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.500
about decrypting the Xige Code.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.620
The Xige Code is extremely
important to us.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.500
It's the strongest fortress

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.770
on our cryptographic battlefield.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.460
The only reason the Third
War Zone can hold out

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.100
is entirely because of the Xige Code.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.340
It's about the lives of hundreds
of thousands of soldiers

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.890
in the Third War Zone's
five army groups.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.500
It absolutely must not be
cracked by the Japanese.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.860
What we need to know now

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.140
is how far they've gotten

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.770
in decrypting the Xige Code.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.020
Don't worry,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.380
leave this to me.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.380
I'm the deputy director now,

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.260
I'll ask around for you.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.140
It's too dangerous for you.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.650
They didn't invite us to the meeting,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.460
which means Liang Jingyuan
doesn't trust you at all.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.020
If you ask about it rashly,

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.020
you'll only make him more suspicious.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.340
I'll handle

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.140
the Xige Code myself.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.980
I'll find a way on my own.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.620
Thanks.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.860
You're welcome.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.860
Then what should I do?

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.020
Train the students.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.980
Although they are called students,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.980
they are all talents
in the field of cryptography.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.140
In case they suddenly
ask you a question,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.500
and you can't answer...

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:16.740
How about this.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.020
Tomorrow I'll bring

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.740
all the books and materials
on cryptography from home

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.140
here to you,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.140
so you can memorize them here.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.860
Again?

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.050
Today, the emergency
contact plan is activated.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.460
[Three Heroes and Five Gallants]
There is an important operation.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.770
Take a look at this.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.930
Bai Ye has

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.100
requested to make contact with us.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.530
He used the contact method

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.380
that Hei once reported
to the organization

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.100
to inform us

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.460
that tomorrow at 3 PM,

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.260
each of us will carry a magnolia

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.220
to meet at the Stock Exchange.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.340
The current situation is urgent.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.860
The organization believes that

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.100
among the comrades
who can now operate freely

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.100
in the Japanese-occupied areas,

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:13.500
you're the most

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.740
suitable for going
to the Stock Exchange.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.020
It's just...

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:19.770
It's just

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.500
the organization is worried

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.260
that the enemy might also know

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.980
about this set of
emergency contact methods.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:30.860
So,

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.860
the person meeting you tomorrow

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.220
might very well be

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.530
the real Bai Ye.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.260
Of course,

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.140
it might be a trap set by the enemy.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.530
Mr. Liang,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.140
the communists hide codes
in chess records,

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.260
and use novels as codebooks.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.980
This move is indeed rather ingenious.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.530
No matter how great
China's chess sage Wu Qingyuan is,

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.220
he still became naturalized in Japan.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.740
No matter how ingenious the code is,

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.530
it still ended up being cracked by you.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.360
[Three Heroes and Five Gallants]

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.180
Through my recent interactions,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.660
I've already narrowed it down
to a general range.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.090
Based on what we know,

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.660
Bai Ye

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.460
joined the South Manchuria Railway

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.500
before 1935.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.050
At present, Bai Ye is most likely with

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.260
Dong Jinbo,

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.090
Liu Fangbai,

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.740
Wang Zukai, and Shen Wanqing.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.700
So for tomorrow's contact,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.940
we'll see who shows up
at the Stock Exchange.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.610
Even if the contact fails,

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.130
I'll roughly know the next direction
for the investigation.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.460
On this trip to catch Bai Ye,

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.700
you must maintain

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.260
a humble attitude.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.220
You might learn quite a lot.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.130
Thank you for your trust

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:09.330
and for giving me this opportunity.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.260
Rest assured,

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.500
tomorrow afternoon
I will personally lead the team

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.810
to Yongchang Stock Exchange

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.220
and bring this magnolia back for you.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.050
You must be extra cautious.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.260
Don't worry.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.500
If I don't see anyone tomorrow,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.090
I won't reveal the magnolia.

[Three Heroes and Five Gallants]

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.900
Director Liang.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.740
Hello, Director Liang.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.420
Hello.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.050
You're back.

Close the door.

What is it?

Liang, what are you doing?

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.810
Are you crazy?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.770
Liang,

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.900
this clivia has been grown
for three years,

and it's about to bloom.

Does it look good?

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.050
What is this thing?

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.980
Take care of it from now on.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.330
Don't you like clivia the most?

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.570
What I like isn't important.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.260
What's important is who gave it.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.260
It was given by the Colonel?

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.020
Then there's no need
to throw away the clivia.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.700
Why not keep them both?

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:17.980
Come.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.260
Come.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.220
Do you remember
when we were exiled in England,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.050
I was so bored

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.530
that I read through
the Twenty-Four Histories?

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.740
Between the lines, I saw three words.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.940
Do you remember what they were?

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.530
Be an official.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:43.260
That's right.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.660
Be an official.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.500
Serve whoever gives us
the bigger position.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.660
If we want to climb up the ladder,

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.330
we must show absolute loyalty.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.290
Do you know what absolute loyalty is?

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.130
It means there can only be
one pot of flowers on a desk,

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.090
the flower that the superior
likes the most.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.850
Why isn't Ms. Xian here yet?

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.060
After mahjong,
I still want to go swimming.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.610
It's rare for us to get together.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.020
Don't be so impatient.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.610
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.020
What's good to eat?

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.700
Dumplings.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.570
Dumplings.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:36.850
You two didn't get any

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.330
hot food at work today,

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.740
so I saved some specially for you.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.810
I'm just not sure

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.540
what fillings you like.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.090
What fillings are there?

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.740
This one is pork and cabbage,

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.650
and this one is pork
and shepherd's purse.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.940
Shepherd's purse?

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.220
I've never tried it.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.330
You have to use chopsticks.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.890
I'll get them.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:52.370
Alright.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.300
Stop eating.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.220
Let's play mahjong.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.940
It's getting dark.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.650
Come on, come on.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.300
You two are the lucky ones,

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.330
free and easy,

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.370
unlike me,

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.780
I'm so busy right now.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.060
Liang doesn't trust

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.980
handing over the finances
of the institute

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.060
to outsiders,

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.330
so he insisted I take the position
of Head of General Affairs Office.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:14.020
I thought

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.330
it was going to be an easy job,

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.090
but it turned out to be a pile of work.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.850
I don't even have time
to play mahjong now.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.130
Don't complain.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.170
The General Affairs Office
is a cushy post anywhere.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.650
You can play mahjong anytime,

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.220
but money isn't always so easy to earn.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:28.540
Cushy job?

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.700
What cushy job?

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.300
Liang doesn't think like that.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.370
On my very first day at work,

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.410
he personally wrote three words

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.060
and hung them behind my desk.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.780
Guess what they were?

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.740
Serve with integrity.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.610
How did you know?

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:47.890
My master was just saying

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.540
Director Liang is incorruptible.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.540
What's the use of being incorruptible?

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.610
Other people's husbands
help their wives make money,

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:56.220
but him?

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.170
He only causes me trouble.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.330
The other day I fancied
a pair of gold bracelets.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.170
He's a director after all,

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.610
yet he refused to buy them for me.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:05.460
What's the point?

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:07.780
You mean the new bracelets

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.220
just released by Jincai Jewelry?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.890
You saw them too?

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.170
I knew you'd like them.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.130
I've already told the shop owner

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.330
to make two extra pairs.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.060
I wanted to surprise you.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.060
Biyun.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.460
You shouldn't be like this.

You're going to spoil me.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.740
Li Huan, Miss Yi,

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.370
take a good look at
what it means to marry well.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.170
Marry well?

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.850
These days,

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.570
we buy flowers for ourselves.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.370
I buy them with the money I earn.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.330
You spent your own money?

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:45.410
That won't do.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:46.170
I don't want that.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.410
I win.

This is all Ms. Xian's fault.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.330
She had to pick this prodigy

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.260
as our mahjong partner.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.130
Return it tomorrow.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:00.850
I don't want it.

completely clueless.

I'm interested.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.370
If I buy tomorrow,
will it still be in time?

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:47.370
Let me tell you,

I just got the news,

so it's not necessarily accurate.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:51.650
But this is a short-term trade.

Get in quick, get out quick.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.220
Best to get in tomorrow.

Li Huan.

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:24.130
You have sharp ears.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.020
Here's the thing,

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.260
yesterday I heard Mrs. Lee say

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.780
she was going to
the Stock Exchange today

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.780
to buy a stock.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:31.780
When she told me yesterday,

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.980
I didn't dare agree.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.740
So I wanted to trouble you,

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.060
could you help me buy one?

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.220
It's Nanyang Rubber.

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.940
No problem.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.460
Really?

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.020
Thank you.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:45.060
Please don't tell my master.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:46.980
Remember, it's Nanyang Rubber.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:48.090
Rest assured.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.940
The perfume really smells nice.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.740
Charlie, you go ahead.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.330
Director Lee, I'll be going.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.610
What did she just say to you?

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:05.610
She said I smell good.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.060
Don't pry into kids' matters.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.780
Let's go.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.060
When you are teaching them,

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.020
pay attention to one thing.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.540
The essence of Joseph Lee's code is

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.300
[VIP Room]
a one-time pad encryption algorithm.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.370
Its core lies in the ability
to continuously

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.300
generate a key stream
via a key derivation function,

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.460
and in the seed key used to initiate

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.460
the key derivation function.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.460
So this is by no means
an ordinary codebook.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.090
Understand?

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:46.410
Yesterday I heard Mrs. Lee say

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:47.780
she was going to
the Stock Exchange today

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.850
to buy a stock.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.570
It's Nanyang Rubber.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:51.850
Alright.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:52.410
No problem.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:53.170
Really?

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.260
Thank you.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.220
Oh right,

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.330
please don't tell my master.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.540
Remember, it's Nanyang Rubber.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.780
Rest assured.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:09.810
What are you doing?

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:13.260
Repeat it.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.740
I'm hungry.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.370
I've memorized until I'm starving.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.300
Look at you guys,

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.060
tea here, cigarettes there,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.060
and I've got nothing.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:24.410
And at this hour,

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.650
it should be time

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.020
for afternoon tea.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.610
How about this,

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.300
go to Lao Da Chang

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.890
and get me some Napoleon cake.

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:35.060
I want something sweet.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:35.780
After eating sweets,

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.130
I can focus better,

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.170
and memorize more.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.330
Before I come back,

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.330
memorize all of this.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:50.650
Still a bit off.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.810
If only this could go up a bit more.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.610
Ms. Xian.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:30.460
Interesting.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.330
Ms. Xian, you're here.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.700
Help me buy Nanyang Rubber.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.460
Alright.

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:07.410
By the way,

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.420
is your VIP room upstairs

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:11.980
booked out yet?

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.130
I'm really sorry,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.650
it was booked this morning.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.900
Do you know who booked it?

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.290
I'm not sure about that.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.020
Go on then.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:24.860
Nobody move!

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:27.210
Don't move!

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.570
Nobody move!

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:27.880
Be honest!

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.610
Stand to the side!

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.500
Stand over there!

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:31.940
All of you, over there!

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:32.940
You, over there!

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.980
Under the orders from
the Special Agent Headquarters,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.650
we are here to search for communists.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.170
Please cooperate.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:56.650
No need to panic.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.130
Do you think by
throwing away the flower,

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.170
you can get away?

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:58.730
Move aside.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.940
Move.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:19.090
So scary.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.570
Captain Amu,

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.250
aren't you going to control your dog?

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.770
Isn't this Mrs. Lee?

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:31.610
Mrs. Lee,

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.020
you're here too?

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.610
Director Liang.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:36.820
Director Liang.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.730
Why are you here?

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.290
Buying stocks.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:42.290
You trade stocks too?

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.060
Just for fun.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.900
I happened to get
some insider information.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.690
I even bought two lots for your wife.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:50.340
Really?

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.060
Buying stocks for Yin?

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.250
How come I didn't know?

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.610
Mrs. Lee,

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.380
just now from my spot upstairs,

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.340
I saw someone downstairs
who looked like you,

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.380
running around,

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.380
flustered.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.820
I don't think you came here
to buy stocks.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.290
Are you here to meet someone?

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:22.770
Make it stop barking.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.770
Mrs. Lee,

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:31.210
you still haven't told me

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.940
whether you came to buy stocks

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.460
or to meet someone.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.020
Hold your dog back.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.290
Who are you suspecting here?

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:43.690
Are you suspecting me?

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.860
Biyun.

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:47.210
Biyun.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.420
Joseph.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.900
Why is there a dog here?

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.820
It didn't bite you, did it?

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.650
Joseph.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:02.900
What is this?

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.210
Joseph.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.730
Is this a dog?

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:08.020
Are you alright?

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.130
It's fine.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.130
Director Lee.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:20.820
Director Liang.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:23.250
Thank you.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:28.210
Why are you here?

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.060
It's because of Mr. Shen's
beloved student, Li Huan.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:37.250
Today at the institute, she ran into me

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.380
and told me

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.770
that while playing mahjong
with Biyun yesterday,

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.340
she heard that Biyun
was coming here today

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.900
to buy a stock.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.380
Since there were many people then,

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.690
she didn't feel comfortable asking,

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:50.540
so today she asked me

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:52.420
to tell Biyun for her

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:53.860
to buy her a lot too.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.940
I thought we've always
had good relations,

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:58.380
and this young lady

00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.770
is quite nice,

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:00.610
so

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.940
I came.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.540
By the way,

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.380
Director Liang,

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.460
are you here to buy stocks too?

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.210
On official business.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.540
Didn't I tell you to wait in the lounge?

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:18.940
I waited in the lounge for so long,

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.060
and you never came back.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.690
I was worried something
might have happened to you.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:22.940
I went looking for you.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:25.650
And then got misunderstood
by Director Liang,

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.170
saying I was running around in a panic.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.380
Could it be that I'm carrying

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.250
contraband on me, Director Liang?

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.420
Director Lee, if your eyesight
isn't good, don't run around.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.460
Look how worried you made Mrs. Lee.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.460
What stock are you buying?

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.770
Nanyang Rubber.

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:51.170
Director Liang, it's here.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.170
This is the stock Ms. Xian

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.060
has just asked me to buy.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.610
Are you sure?

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:03.900
Yes.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.860
It's all your fault.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.060
If it weren't for having to find you,

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.770
we would've been home a long time ago.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.380
Sorry, Biyun.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.770
I was just anxious.

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.380
Director Liang's dog even pounced on me.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.420
Captain Amu let this dog

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.860
bite and sniff

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.860
everywhere.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.060
Director Liang,

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.170
I understand you have official duties,

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.380
but if today Biyun

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.690
had been hurt because of this,

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:39.770
do I blame you

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.340
or the dog?

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.770
This is a serious matter.

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.380
I am also on duty.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.380
If this mission cannot be completed,

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.460
will the responsibility lie with you

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.860
or with Mrs. Lee?

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:55.460
Fine.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:57.770
Today I'll cooperate with you

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:57.060
No need.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:59.340
We'll walk ourselves.

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:13.460

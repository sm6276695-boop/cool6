00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.980
How did you know I was here?

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.820
Here's the thing.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.100
This morning,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.900
when I arrived at
the Cryptography Institute,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.100
I saw a whole bunch of people
heading out on a mission.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.060
The target was

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.540
the VIP Room.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.320
[VIP Room]

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.170
Then Li Huan told me

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.380
you were also coming
to the Stock Exchange today.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.820
So I thought I'd come by
to check on you,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.940
make sure nothing goes wrong.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.980
Of course, I know

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.660
that even if I didn't come,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.940
you could handle things yourself.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.380
What did you

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.380
let the dog smell?

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.450
It's Charlie's.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.500
Smells strong, huh?

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.690
Smells pretty good.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.940
Then I'll carry it with me every day.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.940
Ms. Xian.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.380
Were you looking for someone?

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.380
I want to help you.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.940
Ding Yi.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.380
Thank you for today.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.380
You're welcome.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.220
But sorry,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.660
I can't tell you

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.060
anything else right now.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.940
Ms. Xian.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.980
Where are you going?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.570
You...

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.130
Ms. Xian.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.410
I know you have your reasons
for not telling me.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.220
But I want to tell you

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.410
I'm really ready to join you now.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.060
As long as you give me a chance,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.220
I will never let you down.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.490
Where are you going?

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.410
Where to?

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.460
Sanyangli.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.140
You came today just to
accompany me to buy stocks.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.170
Of course.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.290
Don't tell Gu Yangshan

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.020
a single word about other things.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.460
Yi Xiuyuan is now leading people

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.900
in cracking the Xige Code.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.020
Why's that?

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.900
From what I know,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.140
Yi Xiuyuan was once

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.340
one of the top cryptographers
in Chongqing.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.460
But ever since the American experts

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.980
established the black chamber,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.460
he's been sidelined,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.140
so he retired in anger.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.460
I don't know how Liang Jingyuan

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.900
managed to win him over,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.140
and he even brought a batch
of materials from Chongqing.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.170
And this batch of materials

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.220
is now in
the Cryptography Institute's archive.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.370
So we must find out how far

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.460
they've gotten in decrypting
the Xige Code.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.020
Understood.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.900
I'll report to Chongqing immediately.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.780
Wait for my message.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.900
Alright.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.340
I have intel as well.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.460
List of dead armed worker rioters.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.460
You said there was nothing
wrong with Xian Biyun.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.900
But I still didn't feel at ease,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.660
so I used all the intelligence

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.460
resources at my disposal
to investigate her.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.900
On the surface,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.900
she's just a big movie star.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:48.780
But there's one thing

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.850
I feel tricky about.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.250
Lin Changying?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.900
I just investigated this person.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.020
Lin Changying

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.700
was an actor with Huaxia Film.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.340
The year of the purge,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.020
he died during organizing
the labor movement.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.700
All related interrogation records
indicate

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.220
he was most likely a communist.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.810
So what's his connection to Xian Biyun?

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.220
That's the key.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.660
Being in the same troupe,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.780
how could they have
no connection at all?

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.460
It's just like the communist Hongyu

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.020
who infiltrated the troupe.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.340
Xian Biyun said
she didn't know about it at all.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.460
If Xian Biyun

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.780
were merely an actress

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.220
without other identity,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.460
how could she have managed

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.410
to make it all look so seamless?

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.170
I must remind you

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.460
that for the BIS,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.540
communists are far more
dangerous than traitors.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.580
Alright, I got it.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.900
But right now
the priority is the Xige Code.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.540
I have to go buy a cake for Ding Yi.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.170
If Xian Biyun is a communist,

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.930
and you're so close to her,

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.660
your father won't be able to protect you

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.020
and will be implicated as well.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.730
Moreover, the first one to die

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.170
will surely be Ding Yi.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.020
Comrade Bai Ye has rich experience.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.220
He probably realized before me
that there was a spy,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.340
so he threw away the magnolia

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.340
and evacuated in time.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.220
But this also means

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.780
his only means of
contacting the organization

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.340
was exposed.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.020
He won't try to
reestablish contact easily again.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.700
The Party Committee of
the Anti-Japanese United Army

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.460
has informed us
of some information about Bai Ye.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.850
He once worked for
the puppet army in the Northeast.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.220
And there is another important
piece of information.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.020
He has a serious stomach illness.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.220
Hei once applied to the Party Committee

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.140
for medicine to treat stomach ulcers.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.540
I'll try to find a way

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.020
to search for related medical records.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.580
Director Liang.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.660
The Colonel said

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.460
he is already aware of
what happened at the stock exchange.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.660
As for how you plan to
investigate further,

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.250
that's your job.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.290
You don't have to report every detail.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.260
The Colonel only
wants to hear the result.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.180
Yes.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.620
But Tonoji...

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.500
That's your trouble,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.690
not the Colonel's.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.500
Alright, Liang.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.650
If you didn't catch the person,

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.570
just catch him next time.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.170
If you ruin your health with anger,

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.020
I'll feel terrible.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.140
I'm fine.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.460
It's alright, it's fine.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.890
Do you know who I ran into

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.570
at the stock exchange today?

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.460
Who?

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.220
Xian Biyun and Director Lee.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.380
Tell me,

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.050
they just happened to appear

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.410
right where I was capturing Bai Ye.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.260
I can't help but suspect them.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.810
Aren't you overthinking it?

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.980
I sent Biyun to buy stocks for me.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.810
You're still too naive.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.810
You still need to improve
your judgment of people.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.170
You didn't complete the task this time.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.810
Will Sasaki give you a hard time?

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.290
He probably won't.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.570
I know what that old man really wants.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.290
Today at the arrest scene,

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.140
I discovered something interesting.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.290
Do you want to hear it?

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.050
What is it?

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.170
I found Bai Ye

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.170
was like a kite
whose string had been cut.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.570
His value is limited.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.980
But the contact behind him is important.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.170
I can play a long con
to catch a big fish.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.810
If I catch it,

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.770
many other ones from the CPC
Shanghai underground will emerge.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.770
You know that?

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.570
I don't.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.050
I have to find Bai Ye

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.290
and also his contact.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.770
I remember Beethoven once said,

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:19.050
"A major advantage

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.220
of the remarkable people is

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.570
perseverance in the adverse

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.170
and difficult encounters."

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.290
Madam, you're back.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.810
What's wrong, Madam?

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:19.890
You just got back too?

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.050
You're back.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.810
Where did you go this afternoon?

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.050
Right after you left this afternoon,

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.810
my stomach started to hurt badly.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.650
So I came back first,

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.050
thought I'd make myself some porridge.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:01.410
I'm feeling better now.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:04.410
You came back alone?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.050
Ding Yi.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.170
Come upstairs with me.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.890
Still not feeling quite right.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:36.460
Come in.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:46.050
Sit.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.650
Thank you for today.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.290
Ms. Xian, don't say thank you to me.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.460
I did it of my own will.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:30.290
Sit.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:35.410
Ding Yi.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.770
I want to seriously talk to you
about something.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.980
I've officially introduced you
to my family.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:44.100
What?

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.890
Are you surprised?

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.380
Ms. Xian,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.220
your family

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.260
agreed with what you've just told me.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.290
Does that mean

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.050
there's a chance

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.650
that I can join you?

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.570
So I'd like to ask about

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.170
the application I made for him
to join the Party organization.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.860
The organization has agreed
to his application in principle,

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.340
but he still needs further testing.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.050
I understand what you mean.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:23.890
After all that's happened lately,

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:25.810
my family feels

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.410
we very much want you to
become one of us.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:32.770
But this

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.930
is not a simple matter.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.530
Do I need to go through any procedures?

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.170
For example, write an application?

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:41.570
I can write it right now.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.170
Sit down.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:47.410
Ding Yi.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:50.410
What do you think

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.020
our family is?

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.530
Just like our troupe,

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.530
a group of like-minded people

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.980
living together like family.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.460
It has the warmth of home,

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.050
and also iron discipline.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.890
In my view,

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.500
our family

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.530
is a solid fortress.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.980
Every family member is
a brick or stone of the fortress.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.770
We cover each other
and are closely connected,

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.690
together forming
a solid line of defense.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.930
And behind that line of defense

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.460
is the masses.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.260
Ding Yi,

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.930
joining our family

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.650
is not only a commitment to yourself,

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.290
but also a solemn commitment
to the motherland and the masses.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.860
Are you truly ready

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.620
to become part of this fortress?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.290
I'm ready.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:16:59.860
Good.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.170
In this particular situation,

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.770
you joined in a critical situation.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.500
I can be your recommender.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.500
As for the application,

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.180
I still need to report to the family.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.500
After all, this is a serious matter.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.220
Once the family formally approves it,

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.370
I'll prepare a new outfit for you

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.180
and let you take a solemn oath.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:21.530
Okay.

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.740
Ms. Xian,

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.370
can you now tell me

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.740
your real mission here?

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.660
We have a family member,

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.660
codenamed Bai Ye.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.130
He infiltrated
the Cryptography Institute,

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.180
but his handler
in the Northeast was exposed.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.940
The family has now lost contact
with him.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.980
I entered the Cryptography Institute

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.260
to find him

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.260
and make contact with him.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.700
So today you went to the Stock Exchange

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.260
to meet with him?

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:52.770
Yes.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.260
But today's operation was exposed.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:56.940
We didn't expect

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.530
that Liang Jingyuan
had so much information.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.940
Fortunately, the family

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.740
has already given us a new lead.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.980
We've learned that Comrade Bai Ye
has a stomach condition.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.460
So I hope that you can

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.980
help me closely observe

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.740
Shen Wanqing, Wang Zukai, Dong Jinbo,

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.610
and Liu Fangbai, see if
any of them have stomach problems.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.020
Don't worry.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.700
This is the first task

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.770
that the family
has officially assigned to me.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.260
I will not let the family down.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.770
Any other questions?

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.900
It's just that from now on,

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.260
if there's no one else around,

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.330
just the two of us,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.180
can I call you "comrade"?

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.260
Approved.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.090
Comrade Ding Yi.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.660
Who is it?

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.740
Secretary Jiang.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.370
What is it?

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.180
Director Lee has already gone to bed.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.810
If there's anything, you can tell me.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.020
The new government's intelligence system
has received orders

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.260
to investigate a communist spy.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.660
This afternoon, those who were off duty

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.940
and those who left Sanyangli

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.020
will all be investigated.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.770
Please go to
Director Liang's residence now.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:24.770
Alright.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:38.940
Captain Amu.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.020
I've already told Director Liang
everything I should have said.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.980
Can you let me go now?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.020
Yes, yes.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:45.090
Mr. Lee.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.090
Darling, be careful.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.130
Director Lee.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.770
Director Lee.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:55.770
Mr. Lee.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.940
Mr. Dong and Mr. Liu are here.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:19:59.980
You two

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.090
were not in
the institute this afternoon?

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.940
It's just my bad luck.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.530
While I was out eating noodles nearby,

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.370
my wallet was stolen,
so I went to the police station.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.530
Who would've thought a communist spy
would act at that time?

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.700
Exactly.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.530
When I went out this afternoon,

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.940
my wife called to tell me

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.940
she wasn't feeling well.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.770
I went to the hospital
to get her medicine.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.770
Don't push me.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.940
I can walk myself.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.370
Mr. Lee.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.290
Mr. Shen is here.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.980
Director Lee, Mrs. Lee.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.020
You're here too?

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.260
Mr. Shen,

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.020
you also went out this afternoon?

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.980
It was a momentary slip.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.260
Miss Yi.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.610
Miss Yi appeared
together with Director Liang.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.370
Once I've verified the details,

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.900
I'll come to you again.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:07.660
Director Liang.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.330
Director Liang.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.940
Director Liang.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.330
Sorry to disturb your rest.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.020
I apologize.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.020
Those already questioned may leave.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.330
Pass the word

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.180
that from today on,

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.330
everyone's entry and exit from Sanyangli
must be reported.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:28.330
Okay.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.020
Okay.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.940
Mr. Shen, wait a moment.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.330
Director Lee, Mrs. Lee,

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.260
please.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.330
Director Liang,

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:41.130
this afternoon,

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.370
you should know very well

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.020
where I was and what I did.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.290
Why waste time

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.370
asking us again?

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.500
I need to prepare

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.700
a formal inquiry report

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.770
for the new government.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.530
Please cooperate with Captain Amu.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.660
Rest assured, Director Liang.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.260
We will cooperate fully
with Captain Amu's work.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:06.940
Thank you.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.260
Charlie.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.020
Come upstairs with me.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:19.980
Alright.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:29.610
Darling.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:31.500
Let's go.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.850
Director Lee, Mrs. Lee.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.610
Take care.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.770
Close the door.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:19.770
Director Liang, have a cigarette.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.700
Where did you go this afternoon?

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.370
Mr. Lee said

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.020
he wanted to eat Napoleon cake
from Lao Da Chang,

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.260
so I went to buy it.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.770
Director Lee wasn't
at the institute this afternoon.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.020
Do you know where he went?

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.700
Director Liang, I really don't know.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.700
I'm just his assistant.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.940
He doesn't have to report to me
where he goes, right?

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.940
But I do know one thing.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.020
When I got back to the institute,

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.330
he was already gone.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.130
What's Director Lee's relationship
with Li Huan normally?

00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.610
They're just colleagues.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.770
Don't usually have much contact.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:04.530
That's strange then.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.610
This afternoon,
Director Lee skipped work

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.940
to help her buy stocks.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:18.130
Director Liang.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.090
Could it be

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.770
because of Mrs. Lee?

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.330
They always play mahjong together.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.260
You should know

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.940
the place Mrs. Lee holds
in Mr. Lee's heart.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.130
Alright, you can go.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.180
So I can leave now?

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.020
Good night.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.330
Goodbye, Director Liang.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.020
You usually wear cologne, right?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.940
Mr. Lee usually likes to use cologne,

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.530
so I just use a little from him.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.090
Good night.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.660
Good night, Director Liang.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.940
Mr. Shen, have a seat.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.220
Slow down, will you?

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:26.530
It hurts.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.220
My shoulder's about to be torn off.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.530
Don't be anxious.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.770
Listen, let me explain.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:40.940
When we went to the institute today,

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.020
weren't you on my right side?

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.980
Suddenly Li Huan appeared from my left,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.940
and took me away.
Actually, she wanted to...

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.740
Ding Yi.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.530
It's one thing to send me away,

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.940
but when something this big
happened today,

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.020
you didn't even tell me.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.090
I wasn't prepared at all

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:54.940
for Liang Jingyuan's questioning!

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.180
You really aren't afraid
I'd say something wrong

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.530
and arouse Liang Jingyuan's suspicion?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.090
I didn't even have time
to explain to you

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.220
before they just...

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:10.330
I'm sorry.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:13.940
Let me ask you.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:16.940
What exactly was Xian Biyun's purpose

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.530
going to the Stock Exchange?

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.660
Speak!

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.020
I don't know.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.850
You're still hiding from me.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.220
I really don't know.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.260
Ding Yi, you must understand

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.770
that between me and Ms. Xian,

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.090
there is conditional trust.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.220
You are like a balance scale.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:43.740
If you lean even slightly to her side,

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.740
this delicate balance will be broken,

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.810
and we will all fall into
an endless abyss,

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.090
shattered to pieces.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.050
So, how you act

00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:59.570
is up to you to decide.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:18.500
I understand.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.050
Biyun.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.220
Liang didn't do it on purpose.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.220
A couple of days ago he got word

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.180
that a communist spy would make contact
at the Stock Exchange.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.700
And he happened to
run into you and Mr. Lee.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.900
You know what Liang's like.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.500
His mind's full of schemes.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.900
I explained to him.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.500
I told him
you were buying stocks for me.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.610
You can't be upset with me over this.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.900
Nanyang Rubber really went up.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.180
How do you always
get the news so accurately?

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.810
I don't care.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.130
If there's good news like that again,

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.660
you have to think of me first.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.980
Forget it.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.290
I just helped you buy stocks once,

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.500
and almost got taken
as a communist spy by Liang.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.180
I got questioned for no reason.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:12.980
I'm not doing it again.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:15.980
Mrs. Liang.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.290
Miss Yi said she's on her period,

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.420
so she won't be coming today.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.740
She's such a buzzkill.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.500
We finally have a day off,

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.290
now we'll be one short for mahjong.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.180
Is Miss Yi alright?

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.980
I have some painkillers
from an old Chinese doctor.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.050
They work wonders.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:33.900
I'll take some to her.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.050
Why worry yourself?

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.500
Mrs. Dong should be free today.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.290
Li Huan, please go invite her.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.810
Alright, I'll go get her.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.500
We'll be waiting.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.290
Stay away from Yi Aida.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.610
Why?

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.530
I think she's pretty nice.

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:54.740
Nice? What's nice?

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.530
Let me tell you.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.940
That woman definitely has issues.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.050
Yesterday afternoon,

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:04.940
Liang spoke to her alone again.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:09.370
That day at the Stock Exchange,

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.530
she was there too.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.090
What was she doing there?

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.610
Buying stocks.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.050
And last time when we played mahjong,

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.020
she acted like she didn't care at all.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:22.740
Yet she just wanted to make money.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.500
She could just explain

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.130
this kind of thing clearly.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.700
What's there to hide?

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.700
You don't know.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.660
She has a Belarusian boyfriend

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.900
who is deep in gambling debt.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.180
Belarusians have sensitive identities.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.940
Could Mr. Yi approve it?

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.290
Besides,

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:42.050
why would she want a man

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.500
who lets a woman help
pay off his gambling debt?

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.900
You're not mad anymore?

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.220
Don't be mad anymore.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.180
Tastes good?

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.500
No.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.130
You're so picky.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.900
Miss Yi.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.570
Is your face...

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.180
alright?

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.660
Ms. Xian, what can I do for you?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.660
I heard you got your period

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.420
and your stomach hurt badly.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.810
This medicine I have is
very effective for pain.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.050
I especially brought it to you.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.660
Thank you.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.900
Could I come in and sit for a bit?

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:29.500
Ms. Xian.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:36.330
Ms. Xian.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:39.170
Oh right,

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.330
I have a foundation

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.810
that has excellent coverage.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.330
I'll bring it to you later.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.500
This little bruise

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.130
is nothing.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.570
When I worked in the Northeast before,

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:52.940
my face and hands

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.300
often got frostbite.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.740
It's nothing serious.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.940
You worked in the Northeast before?

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:00.850
Yes.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.260
After graduating from a university
in the Soviet Union,

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.850
I went to work in Hsinking.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:09.820
This time I came to Shanghai

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.210
mainly to reunite with my father.

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:16.090
Thank you.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:19.290
You have quite seniority.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.900
In that case,

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:26.860
Director Liang was really out of line.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:29.940
Two days ago
I went to the Stock Exchange

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.380
to buy stocks for Mrs. Liang,

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.570
and he thought I was a communist spy.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.090
But why he's targeting you too?

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:42.500
Sorry.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.210
I spoke out of turn, Miss Yi.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.730
Since you're not feeling well,

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:49.090
I won't disturb you.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:52.060
I feel a connection with you.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.650
From now on, we should keep in touch.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.020
Sure.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.940
Look, it's connected.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:13.940
This dead stone
has been brought back to life.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:54.420
Darling.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:57.650
Biyun.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.730
You're going out
without tying your tie properly.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.290
Aren't you embarrassed?

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.770
Madam, I'll be careful next time.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.540
Observe whether Yi Aida
has stomach problems.

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.940
Alright.

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:29.460
Thank you.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.940
Don't overwork yourself.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.540
Remember to eat on time

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.380
and

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.250
take your medicine on time.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.940
I will strictly follow your words.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.940
Alright.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.210
So many people are here.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:48.770
Don't say that in here.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.540
Alright, get to work.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:57.250
Careful.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:01.940
Safe drive.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.420
You're back.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:41.020
What's making you so happy?

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.540
I just came back from
the Special Agent Headquarters.

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:46.730
Mr. Li approved

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.460
my plan to lure Bai Ye,

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:51.060
letting me secretly investigate.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.820
What's there to be happy about?

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:54.770
If Bai Ye

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.570
gets caught,

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:59.170
I'll be immediately promoted
to the Head of Operations there.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.130
You should hurry up and catch him.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.980
What's the rush?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.570
Don't you remember what I told you?

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.820
Play a long con to catch a big fish.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.290
Bai Ye will definitely meet

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:16.500
his contact again.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.060
When we catch Bai Ye then

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.900
and the contact too,

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:22.980
we can also take down

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.170
the CPC Shanghai underground behind him.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.170
Not to mention the promotion,

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.060
it'd be possible that I get transfered

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.210
to the military leadership.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:34.690
Tell me,

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.570
what's the plan?

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:37.570
Calm down.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:38.210
Sit there.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.770
News came from Hsinking

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.210
that Hei regularly buys a batch of

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.210
special medicine for stomach ulcers.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.500
But he doesn't have stomach problems.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.290
What does that mean?

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:00.900
It means that medicine is for Bai Ye.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:04.540
So

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.770
get your General Affairs Office
to spend some money

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.060
and arrange a physical checkup
at our institute.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.770
Check who has stomach problems.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.500
That way,

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.500
we can narrow down who Bai Ye is.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.090
It's that simple?

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.090
Bai Ye is from Hsinking,

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:22.290
absent from the institute on that day,

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.610
and has stomach disease.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:26.770
With all these clues in my hand,

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.460
if I still can't catch Bai Ye,

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:33.650
then your husband would be a total fool.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:39.130
A new announcement.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:40.020
Let's go take a look.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.130
Tomorrow at 9 AM,

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.770
physical checkup at Renji Hospital.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.170
All institute members and families
must participate.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.290
Director Lee.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.130
Miss Yi.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.500
You're not feeling well?

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:05.770
I'm fine.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:07.020
Thank you for your concern.

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:38.540
Miss Yi, what are you doing?

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.900
Sorry, Ms. Ye.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.980
Why so clumsy?

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:43.900
Sorry.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.210
Come in.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.520
[General Affairs Office]

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.940
What's wrong with you these days?

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:57.980
You seem distracted.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:00.340
You're still angry that
Director Liang hit you?

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:03.500
He hit you because you were wrong.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.170
That's separate.

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.290
Don't bring your emotions into work.

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:09.210
If you really don't want to work,
then quit.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.210
Ms. Ye, you misunderstand.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.020
That matter was my fault.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:14.900
I don't blame anyone.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:20.020
And I have been doing my work properly.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.900
It's just
that I'm really not good at it.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:24.500
What I'm truly good at is codebreaking.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.650
Could you speak to Director Liang

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:30.290
and let me return to assist my father?

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.210
I understand you, Miss Yi.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.090
But you must think for me.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.770
Right now only my department
is short-staffed.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:38.770
If you still want this job,

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:39.650
do your work properly.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:41.610
Stop thinking about going back
to the Decryption Section.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:43.570
Otherwise, just quit.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:44.210
I won't stop you.

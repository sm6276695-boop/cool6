00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
(Episode 3)

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.070
Hey, Odajima.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.140
Something just jumped.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.040
Must be a fish. A flying fish.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.550
I didn't see it.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.830
Huh?

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.270
Hey, keep an eye on that area.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.740
Right.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.910
Boat ride, nice.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.270
Let's just ride this all the way to some southern island.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.060
This island's in the middle of nowhere.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.000
This is hardly a southern island.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.530
Let's go.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.990
Hey, where are we going?

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.010
Hey...

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.400
"The Journey to Kill You"

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.610
Hello.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.840
Hello.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.560
Is this place full of old people?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.730
That looks heavy.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.400
By the way, you went to the hardware store
before we got on the boat, right?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.080
What did you buy?

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.140
We'll use it later.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.010
Hey, that's not an answer.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.890
Hey.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.770
More climbing?

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.200
I'm a city boy. Hiking's not for me.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.540
Ugh, another bug.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.490
You're such a drama queen.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.720
Your shoulder...

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.500
Huh?

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.970
There's a...

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:03.970
A stink bug.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.930
Hey, hey, don't those stink?

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.000
Right? They stink, right?

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.170
Hey, get it off me.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.700
Hey, come on, get it off!

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.260
Hey, get it off!

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.550
Hey, please, get it off me.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.020
It stinks.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.180
Please don't be mad.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.910
No way.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.600
You didn't get the bug off me.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.220
I'm sorry.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.790
We're almost there.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.990
Please.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.080
Jeez.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.100
(Incoming Call: Kirii)

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.350
Are we finally here?

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.390
It's so hot.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.480
Give me some water.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.650
Why are we pulling weeds?

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.480
Damn it, I got another bite.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.090
You haven't been bitten at all.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.500
Yes, I have.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.890
No way.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.520
Look at my arm!
They're even biting me for you.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.250
I'm sure of it.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.390
Kataoka-san.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.230
Your body temperature is higher.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.000
And I heard mosquitoes are
attracted to the smell of sweat.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.510
That's probably why they go after you.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.630
Body temperature?

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.770
You're really...

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.560
You're so cold.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.180
Huh?

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.690
Let's keep going.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.570
Can't I use you as bug repellent?

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.770
Argh, seriously.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.660
How long do I have to do this?

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.370
It'll be over soon.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.080
Hey, what are you up to?

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.030
Your parents?

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.970
No.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.300
Please offer some incense for him.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.890
He used to be in our crew.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.890
His name was Asahi.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.130
You're the one who killed him.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.790
Hey guys, look.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.490
Isn't it cool?

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.300
They're a matching set.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.000
You guys are really close, huh?

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.870
The two of us...

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.360
are going to be the boss's right-hand men.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:01.260
But, but, but...

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.800
We've only met him once.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.200
It's just the line work for now.
We've got a long way to go.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.500
- Go get them colored in.
- No, it's not that.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.350
Well... we don't have the money.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.340
So we can't get them colored yet.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.720
Hey, spot them the cash.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.440
You're our only hope, sir.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.600
One day, we'll make big money.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.980
And get them colored in then.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.110
Yeah.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.640
Ahh...

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.280
I can't wait to show Kataoka-san.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.290
Why do you like him so much?

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.450
Hmm.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.010
I don't know.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.070
If you hang out with him, maybe you'll get it.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.230
Really?

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:13.890
Because of you...

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.020
Asahi is dead.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.090
Is that so.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.920
He was one of our own.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:30.710
People like us...

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.780
shouldn't even exist.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.830
I heard he couldn't be buried in his family plot.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.480
They said having a gangster in the family was a disgrace.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.940
And so...

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.930
his mother had to beg everyone...

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.170
just to get him a spot in this remote corner of the island.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.490
Isn't that good enough?

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.020
He's lucky to even have a grave to rest in.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.390
And someone like you to come visit.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.520
It's a good place.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.240
He can rest in peace.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.260
The ocean view is nice, too.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.300
Asahi?

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.380
Asahi.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.940
Asahi...

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.140
Asahi...

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.520
Asahi...

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:54.800
Asahi!

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.840
He was my only...

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.070
family.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:09.980
I see.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.470
Let's go back.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.990
Um...

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:33.970
Hmm?

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.480
Ma'am?

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.900
Are you hitting on me?

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:36.800
N-No.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.470
You're...

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.300
that boy's friend, aren't you?

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.840
The one who always sends money.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.460
Well...

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:49.750
I don't know.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.230
Kumakura.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.830
I have a brother, don't I?

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.040
The kid my old man had with another woman.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.430
There's no such person.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.560
Is that so.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.180
Dad never mentioned it?

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.230
Poor Kataoka.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.230
He's the eldest son, the heir to the family business.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.560
The eldest son...

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.030
It's you.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.280
Kumakura.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.630
Yes.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.330
Was I wrong in how I raised him?

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.170
What do you mean by that, sir?

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.280
Why hasn't Odajima killed Kataoka yet?

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.940
Kataoka is popular with the younger guys.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.400
Don't tell me Kataoka's won over Odajima too.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.590
I don't think that's possible.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.560
What about you, Kumakura?

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:27.890
Hey.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.770
You're always beating around the bush.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.340
I...

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.110
exist to serve the Fourth.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.470
My life...

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.860
is dedicated to that purpose.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.010
So a hired gun is the most reliable after all.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.730
Fourth, if you make another move...

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:56.910
Shut up.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.020
Shut up!

00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.850
Fourth.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.140
My old man always... favored that guy.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.700
It's been that way since we were kids.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.200
Dad was always smiling when he was with him.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.440
That guy is going to take everything from me.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:18.810
Please.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.390
Calm down.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.600
The boat's not here yet.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.510
By the way.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.570
You said you killed two family members
in middle school, right?

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.780
My dad and...

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.020
My mom and sister.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.180
The numbers don't add up.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.270
No.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.390
They add up.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.750
You're waiting for him, aren't you? That fat bastard.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.880
I'm not letting you go.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.360
What are you looking at, huh?

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:08.910
Hmm.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.290
Don't look, you little brat.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.480
Hey.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.700
Hey.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.770
So gross.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:19.760
Stop!

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.680
Shut up.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:24.890
Are you looking down on me?

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.490
- You messing with me, asshole?
- Stop!

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.440
You're all the same! Every single one of you!

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.080
Kill me...

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.450
Please.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.380
Kill me...

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.300
I...

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.630
I killed my father...

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.090
and my mother, who I regard as my older sister.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:32.390
Is that right?

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.720
I...

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.040
I should never have been born.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.310
You talking about yourself...

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:49.910
This is a first.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.060
Someone willing to listen to all this...

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.330
You're the second person.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.760
Mm.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.190
Ah, thanks.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.770
Ow!

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.050
You're incredible.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.060
You took down all five of them.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.520
It was an order from above.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.030
Heartless and emotionless.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.730
Just like a hitman,
you kept throwing punches with a vacant stare.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.310
No way.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.450
You're a good person.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880
Do you...

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:13.930
have a family?

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:17.210
No.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:19.800
I killed them.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.660
I see.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.010
In that case...

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.220
I'll be...

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.460
your family.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:43.660
Was it the guy from the grave?

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.800
The other one.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.250
You talked to him about your family.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.110
Yes.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:53.910
And then...

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.390
I killed him, and as a result...

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.530
Did I become the enemy of the one you loved?

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.510
You were obsessed with him, weren't you?

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.570
No, I wasn't.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:08.990
No, you were in love with him.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.450
That's not true.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:15.150
Hey.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:17.630
How was he?

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.660
- I don't know.
- You're lying.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.820
- For real.
- I don't believe you.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.430
I mean...

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.510
nobody knows about this.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:30.850
Not a soul.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.530
Whether it's a man or a woman...

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.630
I've never had sex with anyone.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.460
Huh?

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:38.900
Get out of here. You're kidding, right?

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.280
It's true.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.270
Just kissing. Nothing more.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.440
You're...

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.630
my first.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.330
What's wrong?

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.460
No...

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.680
It's just...

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:12.810
Alright!

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:14.850
Let's get married.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.580
Huh?

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.760
The women I'm with... they've all been around.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:23.630
I've never been with a virgin before.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.520
But...

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.990
But...

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.820
I'm a man.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:38.980
Let's get married.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:44.580
I have to take responsibility.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:46.730
Because I'm a man.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.550
What a beautiful day.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.360
Wake me when we get there.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.890
What are you looking at?

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:26.790
The flowers.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.870
You like flowers?

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.720
Yeah.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.500
They look just like a woman's... you know.

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.210
Oh, stop it.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.600
Look.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.160
So beautiful, aren't they?

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.140
You know me.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:13.560
The more beautiful something is,
the more I want to destroy it.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.250
(Next Episode)
Boss.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.700
Someone wants that guy dead.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.290
And they're making their move before you.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.080
Kill him.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.890
Then you'll be free.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.310
Well then, let's end this.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.630
The final release.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.680
Aren't you going to kiss me?

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.840
I...

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.160
can fall in love too.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.640
It's only human to have hope, right?

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.430
My old man passed away.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.790
Kataoka-san.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.270
If you go, you'll die.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.650
He finally came alive right before he died.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.730
Screaming, "Where's Kataoka?"

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.470
Did you come here to take everything from me?

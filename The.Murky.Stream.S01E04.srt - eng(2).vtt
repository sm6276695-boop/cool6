WEBVTT

00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:07.341
I said, "Put out the fire."

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:12.221
I thought you were a hard worker.

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:17.309
But it turns out you're nothing
but a bloodsucking leech.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.438
Fine then. Enjoy this life.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.088
The bandits
of the Gyeonggang River

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.756
have dominated the docks.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.384
They embezzle the laborers' wages

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:54.680
and extort money from the merchants
under the pretext of taxes.

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:56.848
The police need to regulate them,

00:00:56.932 --> 00:01:01.019
but they're receiving bribes
and protecting the rogues instead.

00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:03.522
Meanwhile, the bandits are running wild,

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:04.606
oppressing merchants

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.568
and squeezing them dry
of their sweat and blood.

00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:12.155
I pray that the government
imposes stricter laws here as well.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.249
The Murky Stream

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:26.962
FOUR. FATE

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:31.800
The wicked daughter of Choi's guild
filed a complaint

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:34.303
to the inspector general's office.

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:37.180
I was lucky an official in his office
intercepted it.

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:40.392
Do you realize what could have happened
if it reached His Majesty?

00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:46.773
I apologize.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:53.822
That crazy woman.
We could have had a real mess here.

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.160
- I'll go teach her a lesson, then.
- How, exactly?

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:02.539
Ensure she won't do it again.
She just needs... disciplining.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.962
You wanted to see me, sir?

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.340
I received an unsigned letter.

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:15.010
It's an indictment
claiming that you were in collusion

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:16.720
with various bandit groups.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.806
You're taking numerous bribes
and extorting the commoners.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.059
- None of that is true.
- Is that so?

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.144
Then why does this letter clearly state

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:27.314
that you were seen at the West Gate
consorting with bandits?

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:30.108
Coincidence. I saw someone I once knew.

00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:32.861
- Coincidence?
- That is the full truth of the matter.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.112
Really?

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:39.993
All right, then.

00:02:40.077 --> 00:02:41.453
You may leave.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.955
Be more careful in the future.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.103
Yes. You wished to see me?

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.105
Who's in charge of the docks?

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.773
I am, sir.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.818
I need to find someone there.
How might I do that?

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:18.615
Newcomers arrive every day
along with hundreds of drifting laborers.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.202
Well, a name or distinct characteristics
would be a start.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.454
If you have that, I'm happy to ask around.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.210
No need. I'll inspect the dock.

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.379
- Please prepare the horses.
- Pardon?

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:36.508
At this time,
there are no available horses to ride.

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:37.968
There are no horses?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.345
What do you mean by that?

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:44.266
They're gone because we lent four of them
to the General's relatives,

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:48.103
and we rented out the rest to the lords
and the gisaeng house.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.188
- We'll receive payment, though.
- What?

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.149
Tomorrow we can retrieve the horses.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.734
So why not take a look around the dock,
then?

00:03:56.945 --> 00:04:00.240
Sorry, sir.
I have duties. So, if you'll excuse me...

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.137
Oh, wow.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.556
Thank you so much.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.774
Are you sure about giving me this much?

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:34.858
Yes. Just go.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.778
Thank you.

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:48.330
You bastard! Are you crazy?

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:54.002
You can't give them all this.
We won't have any left to pay the taxes.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.879
Got it? Watch this.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.301
This is the wage.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.890
This is a tax sum.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.064
This is the only way
for us to make a living. Okay?

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.233
Try again.

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:27.619
Again.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:36.211
This is the least they need
in order to survive, right?

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:41.675
You are driving me crazy.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.677
Appreciate it.

00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:59.568
You still can't get this right
after all these years?

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.113
Pardon me.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:06.241
- Oh! Hello, my lord.
- May I ask you a question?

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:07.868
I'm looking for someone.

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:11.454
He's quite tall and has a thin face.
Have you seen him?

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:16.126
I don't think
I've seen anyone like that.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.378
All right.

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:32.642
"Thanks, Mudeok."

00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:35.896
Huh?

00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:37.939
"I'm so grateful."

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.818
"I will never forget this."

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.157
Do you think they will ever pay you back?

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.534
Huh?

00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:52.662
Treat them like human beings for once
before you say that.

00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:57.083
What the hell are you talking about?
What a load of shit.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.807
Making a decent living,

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:16.019
do you even know how scary that is?

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.188
Before brother Deokgae settled here,

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.566
each and every day was a living hell.

00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:26.196
We had to witness those damn merchants
joining forces

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.823
and sucking the blood from the laborers.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:32.243
Not even a leech
could suck that much blood from your skin.

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:35.538
Line up!

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.044
At the time,
I got beat up every single day.

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.004
The hell are you looking at?

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:45.423
- Go away!
- That damn clan!

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:48.093
They treated us
like we were less than animals.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.929
Hey. Give me just a little more.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.472
For fuck's sake.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.100
- Just a little...
- Get out of here!

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.562
Okay. Line up, everyone! Hurry up!

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:00.814
Move quickly!

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.691
- Faster! Faster!
- All right, here. Go.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.984
What is this?

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:06.945
If you don't want it, go.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.739
For each boat,
you said I get one hop of rice.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.617
I... I unloaded two.

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.285
Don't I get another?

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.454
Don't be ridiculous!

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.331
Now, get!

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:19.999
Come here!

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:26.089
Before you beat me to death,
I'll die of starvation.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.382
Restore order, now!

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.437
Then, it happened.

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:43.857
He should have held back,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.442
but his damn temper.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.327
Let go. Let it go, you bastard!

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.854
Do you think any of the laborers
helped him?

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.524
Not one. Not a single man helped him.

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.696
They were all probably
too scared to fight.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.532
I, Park Mudeok, was different.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:40.080
By nature, heroes don't fall
from the heavens above us.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:43.124
True heroes rise up on their own
with their feet on the ground.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.668
Take this, Mudeok.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.921
You said he was your friend.

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.589
You should go lend a hand.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:20.245
I, Park Mudeok,
held the sickle in one hand

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.664
and jumped into the center of the fight
by myself.

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:38.638
Get him!

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:46.187
Deokgae used his fists and feet.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.361
And I used a sickle.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.490
Stop there!

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.287
In a fit of rage,

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.914
I smashed the bastards' heads in
one by one,

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.166
and kept pushing forward.

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:07.917
Get him!

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:22.390
When I came to my senses,

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:28.104
everyone except the two of us
were down on the ground.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.485
Deokgae.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:55.256
That is how Deokgae and I
took command of Mapo.

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:00.720
Mudeok, well done!

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.641
After that,
a new era in Mapo began.

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.775
You don't need
a conscience,

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.653
not when it comes to making a living.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.405
With only your fist,

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.659
you can eat as much as you want
for two meals a day.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.080
This is a fucked up world we're in.

00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:30.750
But I don't care as long as I'm okay.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.966
Let's be lawless, all right?

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:41.010
Whether it's a noble or His Majesty,

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:43.930
they don't ever dare
mess with the lawless.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:51.854
♪ I can't go on
I can't go on ♪

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:56.526
♪ This is too absurd
To go on ♪

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.905
Oh, there he goes again.

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:04.492
It's bullshit, everything he says.

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:07.704
Yeah. This time, he says,
he stabbed a man with a sickle.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:11.249
Last time,
he said it was a pickax.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:12.667
A pickax?

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.794
I think it's different every time.

00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:17.422
- Next, it'll be a hoe.
- Right.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.890
I heard what happened in Mapo.

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:32.687
- Apparently, the damage is extensive.
- I'm sorry.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.273
Almost half of the silk
was soaked through.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.027
The cost of medicine and acupuncture
will be quite high.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.070
But we should care for the injured.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.489
The key to trade is calculations.

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.491
Stubbornness shouldn't get in the way.

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:49.579
Calculate the losses and profits

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.582
and go down the path
that results in the most gain.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:53.666
Excuse me.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:55.668
Is that clear?

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.172
Yes, Father.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:02.050
Assistant Officer?
Sir, what brings you here?

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.178
Are you looking
for anything in particular?

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.306
- No, but I have a question.
- Of course.

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.016
I'm looking for someone.

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:12.643
A man from Hamgyeong do
with large, sharp eyes.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.772
Have you seen anyone like that?

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:19.817
Um, I have not seen anyone like that.

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:22.028
May I ask if anything's wrong?

00:14:24.822 --> 00:14:27.200
Understood.

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.161
Assistant Officer, sir.

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:38.211
Here. Please take good care of us.

00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:42.215
- What is this?
- This is the inspection charge, sir.

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.842
And why are you giving this to me?

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.220
Is this not generous enough for you, sir?

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:51.599
- Well, is there something else I can...
- Are you...

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.311
My lady.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.067
Is there a problem here, sir?

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.654
Not at all. Sir, this is the young leader
of Choi's guild.

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:06.489
She owns the salt storage.

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:08.032
What's wrong?

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.410
Is it not enough
for the inspection charge?

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.371
What?

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:15.706
You're saying...

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:18.960
You're saying the bandits
who control the dock

00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:20.753
bribed the Police Bureau officers.

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.047
And that, in return,

00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:25.508
the officers turned a blind eye?

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.469
Yes. And that's not all.

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:32.557
There's a rain charge on rainy days,
flood charge for flooding,

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.225
plus a torch charge at night.

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:37.061
There's also a rush charge
for changing the order.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:40.064
And on top of that,
if we pay the laborers,

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.024
the bandits take half of it.

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:43.943
How could they?

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:49.574
They're collecting unapproved charges
and paying them to the government office?

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:52.910
Perhaps they are.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.997
You know what I saw?

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.792
A bandit and a certain official
embracing each other at the procession

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:01.502
as if they were allies.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.715
It's no wonder this country has issues.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:10.094
- With men like that as our officials...
- Is that right?

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:14.182
And how are you certain
that he is a bandit?

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.434
Are you saying that I'm wrong?

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:20.730
He would rather starve to death
than engage in pointless violence.

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:22.356
I know that much.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.860
If I experienced his cruel behavior,

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.155
would that answer your question?

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:35.077
If you're not in collusion with him,

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:39.123
I sincerely apologize.

00:16:52.386 --> 00:16:56.224
Assistant Officer Jung
is desperate to poke around the docks.

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:59.769
Three old men can't succeed
in managing one child?

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.647
And the horses?

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.441
Yes, sir. I did match the number of horses
with the ledger.

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.276
He may be young,
but he's difficult to manage.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.278
I guess you weren't a good enough teacher.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:13.115
You left him unchecked.
He's made a mess already.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.785
Should we follow the law?

00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:18.079
It was your oversight,

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.623
so go handle it yourselves.

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.541
Eliminating tricky pests

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:24.835
is one of my specialties.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.129
I'll take care of it. Trust me.

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:33.844
{\an8}DONGHONARU

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:35.054
{\an8}Brother!

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:39.934
Brother Chadol!

00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:47.066
Brother Chadol! Brother!

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.318
Wang Hae's clan is storming in!

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.320
Get out of my way! Move!

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.739
It's an invasion. Look, look, look.

00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:59.120
Over there.

00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:01.372
Arm yourselves.

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:04.333
Attack!

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:33.065
Stay, you will join forces with me.

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:37.528
If you do, we will be brothers.

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:41.949
If you don't, we're foes.

00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:51.792
I surrender.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:54.336
You'll be the thumb from this moment on.

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.006
I kneel to you.

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:00.968
Brother,

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:04.597
long may you live.

00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:12.813
I shall unify the Gyeonggang River.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:14.523
And then,

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:17.276
I shall hold the new title to this land.

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:22.990
Brother Chadol bowed to him?

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:24.658
Yeah.

00:21:24.742 --> 00:21:27.411
And Wanghae's clan of only five,

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:29.205
they wiped Dongho clean
like it was nothing.

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.414
Easy as shucking corn.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:34.460
Hey, no way! This isn't child's play.

00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:36.837
How could five people
take on Dongho and win?

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:39.590
I'm telling you. That's what happened.
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:21:39.673 --> 00:21:41.759
Gaechun, tell me every little thing
you saw.

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:46.514
In my whole life,

00:21:47.348 --> 00:21:50.392
I have never seen anyone
who fought so well.

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:52.812
There weren't that many. Just five.

00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:54.647
They weren't even intimidated.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.817
And Wanghae had this crazy look
in his eyes.

00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:06.033
- You really scared me.
- Scary, right?

00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:08.035
They knocked out 10 men like this.

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:09.578
There was also a woman.

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:12.832
She moved lightly through the wind,

00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:16.669
like a leaf... gliding through the breeze.

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:18.712
Flutter, flutter, flutter.

00:22:18.796 --> 00:22:20.422
Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.

00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:27.471
She'd strike and retreat.
They'd go flying!

00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:29.306
- Brother!
- Shit!

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.475
Brother! Brother!

00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:35.646
Brother!

00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:38.357
There's an emergency meeting
for the thumbs right now.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.817
- Huh?
- And our boss,

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.777
he also headed out to Chilgak Temple.

00:22:42.361 --> 00:22:43.404
- Brother.
- Yeah?

00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:46.198
It's just...
would the assistant official allow it?

00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:48.158
We need permission from him
to fight for the port.

00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:51.161
- Hmm.
- Wow. This'll be bad.

00:22:51.954 --> 00:22:53.289
It could cause a ruckus.

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:00.212
How dare he!

00:23:00.838 --> 00:23:02.339
This filthy bastard!

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:06.260
A barbarian playing thumb
of Gyeonggang River.

00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:07.344
Are you going to do something?

00:23:07.428 --> 00:23:09.013
He must have thought we were fools

00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:11.390
to come to our territory
and start swinging a knife around.

00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:13.976
Son of a bitch!
We should slit that bastard's throat.

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:16.353
Yes! The docks belong to us.

00:23:16.437 --> 00:23:18.647
A filthy barbarian has no place here.

00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.274
We must send a strong message.

00:23:20.357 --> 00:23:23.944
If we don't,
who knows what this barbarian will do?

00:23:24.028 --> 00:23:27.114
My Lord, allow me to take care of it.

00:23:27.197 --> 00:23:29.617
Grant me permission.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.660
Announcing
the new thumb of Dongho.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.456
Wanghae is here to pay respects.

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:38.667
How dare you set foot in here,
you barbarian?

00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:41.003
I trust I find you in health
and high spirits.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.389
We should rip that tongue

00:23:52.473 --> 00:23:54.266
right out of your fucking mouth.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.351
Allow me.

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:57.686
Gangseop.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:58.979
Huh?

00:23:59.063 --> 00:24:00.314
You've drawn your knife in haste.

00:24:00.397 --> 00:24:03.067
Allow him to at least talk to us first.

00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:20.876
My lord, allow me to bow to you.

00:24:22.169 --> 00:24:23.963
I am Wanghae, and I'm from Hoeryeong.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.391
You made ties with Joseon
when you were a guide

00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:37.518
during the expeditions up north.

00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:39.228
That is correct.

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:42.106
How can I ever trust someone
who betrayed his people

00:24:43.399 --> 00:24:44.608
to save himself?

00:24:44.692 --> 00:24:46.193
I don't think you understand.

00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:50.781
We barbarians are not all the same,
and you're not my people.

00:24:50.864 --> 00:24:54.201
But becoming a Joseon subject
is for survival.

00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:57.579
Does that answer your question?

00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:08.424
Yes, it does.

00:25:09.258 --> 00:25:10.884
How will you pay for your life?

00:25:11.844 --> 00:25:13.178
Got anything to trade?

00:25:13.262 --> 00:25:15.973
I'll suppress the bandits
in all eight provinces.

00:25:16.682 --> 00:25:18.684
They'll be under your feet, my lord.

00:25:18.767 --> 00:25:21.311
And, eventually, you will become...

00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:23.564
the undisputed thumb here.

00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:28.360
The flowers will bloom under your rule.

00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:32.698
Just let me plant the seeds.

00:25:33.615 --> 00:25:35.034
Okay.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.120
I'll let you live.

00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:40.998
- My Lord--
- Your ridiculous flattery...

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.876
saved you.

00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:46.628
- You must not let that bastard get away.
- Why?

00:25:47.296 --> 00:25:48.922
Isn't this rather good?

00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:51.759
You fear the Japanese.

00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:53.343
This keeps them in check.

00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:55.345
What?

00:25:55.429 --> 00:25:57.473
Didn't this work out well?

00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:04.813
I will pave the way for you.

00:26:07.066 --> 00:26:09.735
For mold like you to thrive in this world,

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:12.696
I'll give you what you need.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.282
A dark and damp environment.

00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:20.954
Good luck thriving.

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:43.769
As you ordered,

00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:48.565
Wanghae is now authorized.

00:26:57.074 --> 00:26:59.159
Oh, my goodness. Huh?

00:26:59.243 --> 00:27:01.120
The rice tastes delicious today.

00:27:01.912 --> 00:27:04.456
Wait till I become second in command. Hmm.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.959
It'll only get better.

00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:10.921
- Things are looking up, boys.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:17.261
Baby, with this cute little butt.

00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:19.555
Eat some more, huh?

00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:21.265
You're gonna have to fight soon.

00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:25.477
Also, as of now, just call me "Brother."

00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:31.984
He's not even listening.

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:35.320
Brother?

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:40.659
Brother Siyul?

00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:48.375
You want something?

00:27:48.458 --> 00:27:50.794
Hey, you need to change the way you speak.

00:27:51.962 --> 00:27:52.963
How do you mean?

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:54.673
"How do you mean?"

00:27:54.756 --> 00:27:57.175
That's how
you're speaking.

00:27:57.259 --> 00:28:00.012
He's right. When you're with us,
you can change the way you speak,

00:28:00.095 --> 00:28:02.055
so you don't sound so classy, right?

00:28:02.139 --> 00:28:03.765
And you can curse a lot, too.

00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:05.142
Right. Here.

00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:06.768
Repeat after me.

00:28:08.896 --> 00:28:11.648
You son of a bitch!
I'm gonna rip your fucking brains apart!

00:28:11.732 --> 00:28:16.570
Fuck! Then I'm gonna slurp it all up,
you fucking piece of useless shit!

00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:18.113
You should practice that one. Practice.

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:20.115
- That was great.
- Try it.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.451
No.

00:28:23.327 --> 00:28:25.996
The word "bitch"
is a disrespectful reference

00:28:26.079 --> 00:28:27.289
to your mother.

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:29.875
I think it's for the best
never to use that word, okay?

00:28:30.584 --> 00:28:32.961
My goodness. Are you a Buddhist or what?

00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:35.505
Just repeat after him.
It's not that difficult.

00:28:35.589 --> 00:28:37.174
- No, no, no.
- Come on. Go for it.

00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:38.800
Yeah.

00:28:40.802 --> 00:28:42.429
I'm good.

00:28:42.512 --> 00:28:45.349
Come on. You've got to close your eyes
and just give it a go.

00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:46.558
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:47.935 --> 00:28:49.770
- Do it, you little shit.
- Huh?

00:28:52.105 --> 00:28:54.191
Listen here, you fucking son of a bitch!

00:28:57.694 --> 00:28:59.154
I'll crack your head.

00:29:06.203 --> 00:29:07.829
Forget it.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.873
I'm not very good.

00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:16.964
You didn't even try.

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.219
Why do I feel so offended?

00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:26.181
That son of a bitch.

00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:27.933
Fuck!

00:29:33.397 --> 00:29:36.233
My goodness! That idiot got beat up again.

00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:38.443
What's wrong? Got hit in the head?

00:29:38.527 --> 00:29:40.112
Is this funny to you?

00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:42.614
Chunsik, that son of a bitch!

00:29:42.698 --> 00:29:43.824
I'll fucking kill him!

00:29:43.907 --> 00:29:46.827
Poor baby. Looks like somebody
still hasn't learned their lesson.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.537
Ah, come on. Just leave him alone.

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:51.415
All bandits have to get beat up a little
to grow.

00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:54.126
Hey, Malbok. Come here and slap on
some dwenjang. Come on.

00:29:54.751 --> 00:29:57.379
- Blood?
- Just eat your food, you idiot!

00:29:58.547 --> 00:30:02.175
One day, I swear I will fucking kill him!
That bastard!

00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:04.177
Chunsik, that asshole.

00:30:04.261 --> 00:30:06.722
Why should we feed him?
He doesn't deserve it.

00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:20.485
Brother, please.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.408
Can we talk for a minute?

00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:30.746
Are you okay? Not hurt anywhere.

00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:34.416
- I am hurt.
- Tell me where.

00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:39.629
That son of a bitch.

00:30:40.589 --> 00:30:43.258
He jumped me, hit me right in the face.

00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:45.719
This isn't the first time he's done this.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.930
And look, he doesn't really scare me.

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:51.433
I swear, I'm not scared of him.

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:55.020
But he's taller than me and much stronger.

00:30:55.103 --> 00:30:58.690
Might there be a way to beat him?

00:31:01.985 --> 00:31:03.236
Try making a fist for me.

00:31:10.077 --> 00:31:11.328
Meet me outside.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.043
Neck...

00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:22.255
heart...

00:31:26.927 --> 00:31:27.928
and crotch.

00:31:30.138 --> 00:31:33.266
- Those are the key vitals.
- Oh.

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:42.943
Are you in pain?

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:45.737
Not at all. I'm okay.

00:31:47.656 --> 00:31:50.200
Which vital was that one?

00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:09.136
You... You could have killed me.

00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:12.597
If you hit any of those key vitals,
the fight is over.

00:32:14.558 --> 00:32:16.434
Understood?

00:32:18.854 --> 00:32:19.855
Your turn.

00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:39.499
Next time, I'll teach you some techniques
to unbalance your opponent.

00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:40.834
What?

00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:43.753
Whoa, whoa! Ow!

00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:50.594
Brother!

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.347
Can I call you that?

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.481
Sure.

00:33:07.694 --> 00:33:09.070
Thanks, brother.

00:33:13.074 --> 00:33:15.035
Think twice before acting up.

00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:19.831
The thumbs are more venomous than vipers,
nowadays.

00:33:19.915 --> 00:33:21.208
They're full of spite.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.211
I don't think it's worth provoking them.

00:33:25.295 --> 00:33:27.881
For now, you should try to lay low
and wait.

00:33:27.964 --> 00:33:30.508
Are you afraid of who could be watching?

00:33:31.092 --> 00:33:33.178
Is laying low beneath you?

00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:35.055
Are you superior to everyone else?

00:33:37.766 --> 00:33:41.228
I only took you in
because it was the lord's order.

00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:44.397
But if your hard work
brings us many rewards,

00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:47.651
I wouldn't have a single reason
to refuse you.

00:33:49.486 --> 00:33:52.072
I'll bring in double the amount
of what you get now.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.453
Just don't use the swords.

00:33:59.371 --> 00:34:01.414
The aftermath is quite the mess.

00:34:03.959 --> 00:34:06.086
Be sure to get home safe in the dark.

00:34:07.921 --> 00:34:09.297
You too.

00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:11.758
You wouldn't want to get hurt.

00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:23.561
- Yes?
- May I ask you a question?

00:34:23.645 --> 00:34:24.771
Yes, my lord.

00:34:24.854 --> 00:34:26.189
I'm looking for someone.

00:34:27.107 --> 00:34:29.776
Perhaps you've seen him.
A tall man with a strong build.

00:34:30.694 --> 00:34:32.988
- Pardon.
- He's a young man from Hamgyeong do

00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:34.531
with large, sharp eyes.

00:34:38.118 --> 00:34:39.286
Really think carefully.

00:34:40.453 --> 00:34:42.038
I'm not sure, my lord.

00:34:42.872 --> 00:34:43.873
Very well.

00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:52.799
Brother! Brother!

00:34:52.882 --> 00:34:55.593
- Brother! Brother!
- What? What is it? What?

00:34:55.677 --> 00:34:57.137
What's got you so worked up?

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.597
The Police Bureau is looking for someone.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.015
- It's brother Siyul, I think.
- What?

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:02.475
Police Bureau?

00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:04.352
Where...

00:35:05.312 --> 00:35:06.938
Siyul!

00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:08.857
Siyul!

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:14.112
Hey, Chunsik, let's fight today!

00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:33.256
That's him,
the piece of shit who beat me.

00:35:34.674 --> 00:35:36.426
Promise me you won't step in, brother.

00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:39.012
Let me handle this trash.

00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:45.226
Unless you wanna get
punched in the face too,

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:48.146
I suggest you all back up.

00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:50.315
Looks like you still haven't learned
your lesson.

00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:54.569
Maybe if we cripple him,
his dumb ass will finally get the message.

00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:56.154
He's so pathetic.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.995
You little runt, I was talking.

00:36:06.414 --> 00:36:07.457
What was that? Huh?

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.836
Come here!

00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:21.096
Come at me! Come on!

00:36:25.392 --> 00:36:27.268
Hey! Wait!

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:39.614
Holy shit!

00:36:47.914 --> 00:36:50.542
See that? That was just a preview.

00:36:51.334 --> 00:36:54.838
You even think about it,
I'll smash your crotch in, too!

00:37:09.936 --> 00:37:11.855
Brother! Brother!

00:37:11.938 --> 00:37:13.064
We're in trouble.

00:37:13.148 --> 00:37:14.232
What now?

00:37:15.108 --> 00:37:17.193
Bang is heading this way.

00:37:17.277 --> 00:37:19.195
He's coming over here with his guys.

00:37:19.279 --> 00:37:20.739
Find Siyul! Hurry! Come on.

00:37:20.822 --> 00:37:22.115
- Let's go!
- Siyul!

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.583
- Hey, Siyul!
- Siyul!

00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:34.335
Where are you?
Look here! Look here!

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:38.047
Brother! Brother Siyul! Siyul!

00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:54.063
Find him?

00:37:54.856 --> 00:37:56.441
- Not here.
- Siyul!

00:37:56.524 --> 00:37:57.650
Siyul!

00:37:57.734 --> 00:37:59.277
Brother!

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.696
We looked everywhere and can't find him.
He's gone!

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.239
Wait! Is he taking a shit?

00:38:03.323 --> 00:38:07.577
- No, Gaechun already checked the shithole!
- Oh fuck! Did he just get up and go?

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.370
Why the hell do you think
he'd run away from me?

00:38:09.454 --> 00:38:11.331
Shut your mouth and keep searching,
you idiot!

00:38:11.915 --> 00:38:12.957
Wait. Where's Malbok?

00:38:13.041 --> 00:38:14.334
He's also missing.

00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:16.669
I haven't seen him for a while.

00:38:16.753 --> 00:38:17.962
What if...

00:38:18.046 --> 00:38:19.088
they're together?

00:38:19.172 --> 00:38:21.508
Hey, find them already.
Get those two over here.

00:38:25.637 --> 00:38:26.763
This is bad.

00:38:28.932 --> 00:38:29.974
What do we do?

00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:36.564
- Hurry up and search the area.
- Yes!

00:38:41.694 --> 00:38:44.948
Hi, there! Oh, wow!

00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:48.535
Mapo's so beautiful today, isn't it?

00:38:49.118 --> 00:38:51.120
Look at your face.

00:38:51.204 --> 00:38:53.248
I guess life is treating you well.

00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:55.583
It's all because of you.

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:57.168
- Listen.
- Yes?

00:38:57.252 --> 00:38:59.128
Lots of people who try to piss
in my territory

00:38:59.212 --> 00:39:00.213
lose their lives.

00:39:00.296 --> 00:39:02.507
Oh, brother.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.218
What's with the harsh tone today?

00:39:05.301 --> 00:39:07.011
Tell me where the tall one is.

00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:08.972
Who?

00:39:09.848 --> 00:39:11.933
Did you think I wouldn't know?

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:13.768
Where the hell is he?

00:39:14.435 --> 00:39:17.063
Brother, I can't find him anywhere.

00:39:17.146 --> 00:39:19.524
Maybe he saw this coming and took off.

00:39:23.987 --> 00:39:26.656
Oh! This is driving me crazy.

00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:28.825
If I had my way,
I would just skin you all alive

00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:30.076
right where we stand.

00:39:30.827 --> 00:39:32.787
- Come with me.
- Where?

00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:34.497
You're gonna see brother Yoon now.

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:36.457
Oh... Why?

00:39:36.541 --> 00:39:39.586
Just do what I say
and stop asking so many questions, okay?

00:39:39.669 --> 00:39:42.630
Sure, brother. I'll go.

00:39:45.258 --> 00:39:47.802
I should let you know
I have to take a dump right now.

00:39:47.886 --> 00:39:50.221
Would it be all right
if I went really quick?

00:39:50.305 --> 00:39:53.057
Why do you always make me
say things twice?

00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:55.685
I've had enough. Take him away.

00:39:56.895 --> 00:39:58.980
- Hey! Hey. Hey.
- Son of a bitch!

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:01.482
How dare you put your hands on me?

00:40:01.566 --> 00:40:03.109
Enough!

00:40:03.192 --> 00:40:04.861
Just give up and come with us.

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:07.363
You little brat! Let go of me right now!

00:40:13.536 --> 00:40:14.871
Piece of shit!

00:40:14.954 --> 00:40:16.623
Boo!

00:40:32.388 --> 00:40:33.890
Oh, yeah!

00:40:46.152 --> 00:40:48.780
Yeah! We got them now!

00:40:52.575 --> 00:40:54.827
Why, boss? Why are you doing this?

00:40:56.996 --> 00:40:58.456
I've heard some talk...

00:40:59.415 --> 00:41:01.918
that you've been hanging out
with the man who beat up Bang.

00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:05.755
No, no. That's utter nonsense.

00:41:06.506 --> 00:41:09.634
Who said that? Was it one of you?
That's not true.

00:41:09.717 --> 00:41:12.595
- Is that so?
- Uh-huh. Of course.

00:41:12.679 --> 00:41:13.846
I heard what happened.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.431
I felt sorry for our poor brother.

00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:17.600
My heart was in sorrow and pain,

00:41:17.684 --> 00:41:19.060
and--

00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:24.190
Who is it? Is he here?

00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:26.526
I want to see your damn face!

00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:28.319
I hear you're quite a fighter.

00:41:28.903 --> 00:41:31.280
He must have got scared
and scurried away like a mouse.

00:41:31.364 --> 00:41:32.365
Really?

00:41:33.199 --> 00:41:34.701
- Brother.
- Huh?

00:41:34.784 --> 00:41:36.035
I warned you.

00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:39.330
- Get him.
- Yes, boss.

00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:41.207
Brother!

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:42.291
All right, get the club.

00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:43.960
- Let him go!
- Come on!

00:41:44.043 --> 00:41:46.504
Please don't kill him!
Please don't!

00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:50.550
Don't! Please don't!

00:41:50.633 --> 00:41:52.468
Mudeok is so sorry!

00:41:52.552 --> 00:41:54.178
Please don't hurt him.

00:41:54.262 --> 00:41:55.680
Stay still, will you!

00:41:58.141 --> 00:42:00.184
- Let go!
- If you become crippled,

00:42:00.268 --> 00:42:02.895
I'll give you this stick,
and you can use it as a cane, all right?

00:42:02.979 --> 00:42:04.522
No! I beg you!

00:42:04.605 --> 00:42:05.940
Stop moving around,

00:42:06.024 --> 00:42:07.358
or all of this will be worse for you.

00:42:07.442 --> 00:42:08.526
Ah! You bastard!

00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:10.737
You get off of me!

00:42:11.404 --> 00:42:14.741
- He keeps squirming!
- Ahh! Boss! Boss, please!

00:42:14.824 --> 00:42:16.743
Hey, Deokgae!

00:42:16.826 --> 00:42:20.830
Boss! They're gonna kill me!
Help!

00:42:22.915 --> 00:42:24.876
Please save me!

00:42:31.424 --> 00:42:32.800
Are you ready?

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:36.137
- Brother!
- Brother!

00:42:42.143 --> 00:42:43.394
Shut up and hold him!

00:42:43.478 --> 00:42:44.479
Come on!

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:47.273
Hold him tighter.

00:42:49.317 --> 00:42:50.526
Hold him tight.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:51.903
Get it together.

00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:54.363
Look at the balls on you...

00:42:54.447 --> 00:42:55.740
coming for the forefinger position.

00:43:02.163 --> 00:43:04.207
Who are you?

00:43:13.633 --> 00:43:15.384
Brother, he's here.

00:43:21.682 --> 00:43:22.850
Oh, Siyul!

00:43:25.061 --> 00:43:26.979
So you're Mudeok's right-hand man.

00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:29.607
Just let him go.

00:43:30.358 --> 00:43:31.526
Nice face.

00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:33.277
Let's break it!

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:49.085
- He is loyal.
- He's with us.

00:43:49.168 --> 00:43:50.628
Oh, shit!

00:43:56.342 --> 00:43:58.219
Don't just stand around gawking.

00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:00.471
Get in there and cripple this asshole!

00:44:10.439 --> 00:44:11.941
Brother! Brother!

00:44:12.024 --> 00:44:13.025
Brother!

00:44:14.026 --> 00:44:15.027
Are you all right?

00:44:16.946 --> 00:44:17.947
It's okay.

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:21.492
You're barely off your mother's tit,
and you think you're something, huh?

00:44:21.576 --> 00:44:23.703
He's got a knife.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.415
All right. Fine.

00:44:28.207 --> 00:44:31.711
Hope you enjoy the smell
of your own blood. Come on.

00:44:43.639 --> 00:44:44.724
What happened?

00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:07.330
Enough!

00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:20.927
Yoon,

00:45:22.637 --> 00:45:25.765
if you're gonna use a knife,
at least show some class.

00:45:25.848 --> 00:45:27.433
Everyone, as you were.

00:45:27.516 --> 00:45:29.518
Get the wounded inside.

00:45:30.102 --> 00:45:31.103
And you.

00:45:32.647 --> 00:45:33.856
Come with me.

00:45:35.024 --> 00:45:36.192
Let's have a drink.

00:45:40.947 --> 00:45:43.366
Go! Go, go! Go on! Follow him!

00:45:49.038 --> 00:45:51.415
What? I asked you to come.

00:45:51.999 --> 00:45:54.043
Go, go! Go! Go on.

00:45:54.835 --> 00:45:55.836
Go.

00:45:56.754 --> 00:45:58.005
I do not drink.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.008
I think I'll just be leaving now.

00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:05.388
Have you lost your fucking mind?

00:46:06.138 --> 00:46:07.390
Boss,

00:46:07.473 --> 00:46:09.058
since he is my underling,

00:46:09.141 --> 00:46:11.352
I will make sure he understands his place.

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:12.645
Yes, sir.

00:46:12.728 --> 00:46:15.940
Move it, you idiot!

00:46:16.023 --> 00:46:19.151
Look, you're obviously very skilled.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.737
So work for me,
and you'll get to have fun.

00:46:21.821 --> 00:46:23.531
Run the clan for a bit.

00:46:24.073 --> 00:46:25.533
You can do that, right?

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:27.743
I have no desire to be a bandit.

00:46:27.827 --> 00:46:28.828
- Oh, shit.
- Brother,

00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:31.163
you don't want to put up
with this idiot every day.

00:46:31.247 --> 00:46:33.582
What you need is a good beating, huh?

00:46:34.375 --> 00:46:35.376
Yoon,

00:46:36.043 --> 00:46:38.963
I'm not sure that you can handle this man
all on your own.

00:46:39.046 --> 00:46:40.381
You bitch!

00:46:41.841 --> 00:46:44.051
Go to him. Go!

00:46:44.135 --> 00:46:45.720
Oh, my goodness. He's crazy!

00:46:45.803 --> 00:46:47.263
Go, you idiot!

00:46:48.389 --> 00:46:49.515
Look.

00:46:50.975 --> 00:46:53.269
You're not the only one with pride here.

00:47:09.076 --> 00:47:10.453
Well, then,

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.122
I'll have to teach you a lesson,

00:47:13.205 --> 00:47:15.291
reestablish order around here.

00:47:19.545 --> 00:47:21.797
And if that order is not to your liking,

00:47:22.923 --> 00:47:24.717
then remake it so that it is.

00:47:25.426 --> 00:47:27.595
That's the sort of grit real men have.

00:47:30.348 --> 00:47:32.224
What do you say to that?

00:47:41.025 --> 00:47:42.568
Don't be stupid.

00:47:43.235 --> 00:47:45.071
I know what you're thinking.
Just back down.

00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:54.497
Let's fight.

00:47:56.165 --> 00:47:57.500
Very good, then.

00:47:59.001 --> 00:48:00.336
I don't need to ask twice.

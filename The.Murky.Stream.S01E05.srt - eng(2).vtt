WEBVTT

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.297
Teach him a lesson!

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.347
Kick his ass, boss!
Don't go easy on him!

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:21.563
Yes!

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.938
You've got some real fire in you,
I'll give you that.

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.440
Where did you learn to fight?

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:07.401
Didn't come here to talk.

00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:28.875
Hey. Let's end it here.

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.797
You can't win with courage alone.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.465
It's not over.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.008
You're only going to get hurt.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.561
How considerate of you.

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.150
The Murky Stream

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:39.863
FIVE. WINNER AND LOSER

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.794
Boss, this is treason.

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.422
And the only answer is the sword.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.022
- Oh, what do we do?
- This is not good.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.900
Brother Siyul, get up.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.445
Get up, brother Siyul.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:30.163
Don't blame me. I'm just restoring order.

00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:32.707
If you plan on crippling me...

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:35.669
I'd rather you just kill me.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.638
He's going to cut him!

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.765
Show them
how we treat traitors, boss!

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.976
Come on, do it, boss!

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:53.770
Here we go.

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.397
Oh, here it comes!

00:05:58.275 --> 00:06:00.735
Come on, do it!

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.010
No more!

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:29.973
Boss!

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.241
Don't do it, you bastards!

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.760
- Boss!
- Boss!

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:09.304
- Hey! Help him!
- Boss! Boss!

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.069
What's that?

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:25.403
What's on your hand?

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.032
Is that blood?

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:34.996
Where are you going?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.417
It's not like I had
anything to drink, I don't get it.

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.002
What's wrong with me?

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:43.254
Why'd you come back alone?

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:45.465
Where did the others go?

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:52.055
Can't you hear me? Huh?

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.274
We're in hot water.

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:06.277
W... What?

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:09.072
I... I don't know.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:19.374
I... I got a sickle and stabbed Deokgae.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.781
Is he awake? How is he doing now?

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.492
He's crippled.
There's nothing I can do for him.

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:03.668
Let's do this.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.004
We'll go. We'll ask him to forgive us.

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:09.007
Tell him that we sinned.
We'll beg for mercy.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.384
We'll get on our hands and knees.
What do you say?

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:13.344
Are you listening?

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:15.847
Did you hear what I said?

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.101
Why grab the sickle
if you're gonna be this scared?

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.186
What?

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:23.521
You treated the thumb
like he was everything.

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:25.815
So why did you stab him?

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.028
I don't know why.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.615
I must be crazy! I lost control, so what?

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.494
Aren't you next?

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.622
Look, if the boss steps down, then...

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.624
then you'd be the best candidate in line.

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.001
You're the best fit in age and rank.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:46.836
Anyone there?

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:50.340
Yes, coming, boss.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.304
- Where is Mudeok?
- Want me to get him?

00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:57.931
You think you'd be able to?

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.267
Just tell him we need to talk.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.477
As you wish.

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:08.066
Hey, all right. Let me ask something then.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.568
Why'd you show up and start fighting? Huh?

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.612
All of your problems
would be solved if I died!

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.948
Was it something like,
your pride as a man or what?

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:17.158
- Answer me!
- It wasn't that at all.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:20.120
Then what, were you worried
about your little friend? Huh?

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:22.497
It's just that I swore an oath.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.040
What kind of oath?

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.335
I made a promise
that I would never run away.

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:29.337
What the fuck are you talking about?

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.381
You make no sense!

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.633
There was no other reason.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.429
Ugh, shit.

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:41.558
Things happen every day
that I can't understand.

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.727
I don't even know
why I did what I did!

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.148
I'm not afraid.

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:53.403
Dying isn't the thing I'm scared of.

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:59.242
It's this... having to live like this.

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:01.161
That's what scares me.

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:04.914
I can't believe I have to sit here
and listen to this shit.

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.214
What if we tried making it on our own?

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:17.886
On our own?

00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:20.305
We'll live together...

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:23.433
as brothers.

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:28.855
On good terms, what do you say?

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.650
T... Together?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.321
Brother.

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:49.375
I will protect you.

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.262
I had a dream last night.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:04.098
I saw my mother.

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.603
She held my hand and wrapped me in silk.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:15.735
And here, I thought
that was a good omen.

00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:19.322
The thing about being a man is...

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:21.449
sometimes you succeed...

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.453
sometimes you fail...

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.165
sometimes you have to leave.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.711
You can't, boss.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.173
If you leave,

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:40.009
then who will guard this place?

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:47.850
With my leg like this?

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:54.232
I have no regrets.

00:12:57.568 --> 00:12:58.778
This was fate.

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:00.989
The will of fate.

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:04.784
That young man.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.121
He's strong.

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:11.499
If Yoon hadn't stabbed him
before we fought...

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:14.502
I wouldn't have won.

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:17.213
He deserves it.

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:33.688
You meet a tiger in the woods.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.816
If you try to fight it,
you're going to die.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.443
And if you tried to run,

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:40.320
you wouldn't get far.

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:42.613
So what do you do?

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.907
You climb on his back and hang on.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:05.386
Deokgae.

00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:07.305
Never get off.

00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:09.390
Don't you ever get off his back.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.189
Deokgae.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.444
Sorry, I...

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:23.780
- I'm sorry...
- Live with everything you have.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.627
There goes King Yeomra,
just like that.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.296
You heard about the man
who took on the thumb, right?

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.840
He was one of us.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.384
You think things will get any better?

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:28.136
They might if he's in charge.

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:29.595
Don't get your hopes up.

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:32.723
Deokgae used to be a laborer himself
back in the day.

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.184
He and I used to take beatings
side by side.

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:37.103
Right.

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:42.900
The second they go up the ladder
is when they change.

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.319
They start to forget their roots.

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.280
They'll live their way.

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:49.699
And we'll live our way.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.284
Ain't that the truth.

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.375
Deokgae.

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:01.210
Take care.

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:15.016
- Move it further.
- Hey, don't fall in!

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:21.689
Oh?

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:27.820
Everyone, get out.

00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:30.781
Move.

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.159
Move, move, move.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.413
Siyul, you stay put though.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.421
Shut the door.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.098
So Mudeok became the thumb.

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:57.350
Or so he says.

00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:00.186
What does that mean though?

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:02.980
Means just that.

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:06.859
How does that make any sense when the man
can't even take care of himself? Huh?

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.112
You know he doesn't have
what it takes to lead anyone.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:13.032
You did this.

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:15.576
He's the thumb because of you.

00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:20.122
Siyul, listen.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.834
My father was a servant.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.922
It was the worst
for our family during the famine,

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:31.467
so Father sold my oldest sister.

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:37.014
In the next barley harvest,
he sold my second-oldest sister, too.

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:39.600
It was unthinkable to sell his son.

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.102
So I was next in line.

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:44.272
I was sold to a lord...

00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:47.275
but when I got sick
and started vomiting blood...

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:53.823
he tossed me to bleed out on the street.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.829
I was burning up with a fever.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.081
I lay down in the snow.

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.502
I couldn't feel how cold it was.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:09.797
I woke up in this house.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:15.469
That man, for months,
he gave me medicine and food.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:18.347
He looked after me.

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:20.725
And he nursed me back to health.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:24.770
After that, I settled down here.

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.023
And now, I live as his wife.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.191
Listen to me.

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:33.738
It doesn't look like it,
but Mudeok has a kind heart.

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:40.328
It just happens to be so small,
it's almost like it doesn't exist.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.790
It's still there, though.

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:51.213
He deserves a chance to live, doesn't he?
Even just a little?

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.260
Look, I promise that I'll cook for you.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.972
Just don't abandon him, that's all.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.057
Please?

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:04.727
Can you promise me that?

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.697
There's no need to worry.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.456
Can I finish my dinner?

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.051
I'm placing my trust in you.

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:41.597
Cut.

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:46.811
And... there.
Done. Would you look at that?

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:49.313
Wow, you look great!

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.190
Just like a true thumb, right?

00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:53.067
- Oh! You look so dashing now!
- Yeah.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.152
Take a look. See?

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:59.448
Boss, from now on, we can stand tall.
Oh, and piss with our legs stretched.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:00.825
That's not the half of it.

00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:03.202
Even the air smells different
if you breathe it in.

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:05.121
Smell it, smell it.

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:11.627
Jungbok, you idiot.

00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:14.755
- You farted, didn't you?
- Yes.

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:17.007
Still smells nice.

00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:31.105
We will serve you
with our best, boss!

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:35.860
Everyone!

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:38.446
D... Do your best for the clan!

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:39.864
We'll do our best!

00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:47.163
Move. Now.

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:53.961
I hope you do well, boss.

00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:56.964
- Congratulations.
- I will give you my best, sir.

00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:58.841
Please accept my gratitude!

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.843
Thank you, boss!

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.928
Boss! I will serve you
to the end!

00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:04.430
Congratulations, boss.

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:06.682
- Congratulations, boss.
- Boss!

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:07.767
Congratulations.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.394
Congratulations.

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:11.771
Th... Thank you.

00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:14.565
Congratulations on the position, boss.

00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:29.079
Brother!
I've got them here! Here!

00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:30.539
Hey! Quit running, man!

00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:32.750
- You'll get hungry!
- Brother, I got it!

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:35.586
Why isn't he taking it easy?
We get to eat good now.

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:36.796
He doesn't have to do all that anymore.

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:39.423
He's gotta be an idiot
for working so hard.

00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:42.510
Sorry, um, what are you doing exactly?

00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:45.012
We're throwing up
a little shade for the workers here.

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:46.514
It gets hot workin' in the sun!

00:21:46.597 --> 00:21:49.099
Our forefinger brother
ordered it for you.

00:21:52.353 --> 00:21:53.354
Oh.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.106
Push the stick a little to the back.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.650
Look at our forefinger.

00:21:57.733 --> 00:21:59.568
He's clueless about the world.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.570
What a fool.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.656
They'll walk all over you
if you treat them too good.

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:05.825
If you're kind to them,
you'll get stabbed in the back for it.

00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:07.743
And being modest is for losers.

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:10.246
Exactly. Why is it that people
wanna rise in status?

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.706
So they can live comfortably
without having to work.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:13.791
That's right.

00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:17.503
He's just wasting time
doing all that for nothing.

00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:29.181
I can't believe this is our home now.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:31.934
Poke around a bit.

00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:40.109
Do you like it?

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.820
I'm so happy, but also worried.

00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:43.988
No need to worry.

00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:46.240
Now you'll only use a golden chamber pot.

00:22:46.323 --> 00:22:48.617
And you'll start wiping
your ass with a silk cloth.

00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:53.205
As of today,
there's no more excrement charge.

00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:55.875
If you need to relieve yourself,

00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:58.168
the shithole is now free
for anyone to use.

00:22:58.252 --> 00:22:59.253
Are you serious?

00:22:59.336 --> 00:23:01.547
All I ask is don't let it overflow.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.383
Take turns to keep it clean.
Stick to the schedule you make.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.011
This comes straight from your thumb.

00:23:07.094 --> 00:23:08.971
Sitting right there. His decree.

00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:15.769
What the hell is with all this chatter!

00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:19.398
What is it, you miss it already,
you want me to give you more taxes?

00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:23.819
Look, if I'm being nice, just say,
"Thank you for your boundless generosity."

00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:27.239
- How dare you all disrespect me?
- All right now! Dismiss!

00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:31.744
That was great, boss. Good job.

00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:33.621
All this time, and you learned nothing.

00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:35.873
You're just spoiling these idiots rotten.

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.253
Here you are.

00:23:43.213 --> 00:23:45.674
I had to pay seven pil of silk for this.

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:47.968
Thank you for your work.

00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:55.559
Sir...

00:23:56.852 --> 00:23:58.771
a map can be very dangerous.

00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:02.399
You need explicit permission
from the government to use them.

00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:05.527
Without that, it could look suspicious.

00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:09.865
What can I do? The Guardian General
himself asked for this.

00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:13.035
There's no need for you to be concerned.

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:20.250
He is one of the highest-ranking nobles
in the land.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.836
He has direct ties to the throne.

00:24:23.837 --> 00:24:26.090
It's important to leave a good impression.

00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:27.800
I implore you, sir.

00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:30.135
Please be careful.

00:24:42.272 --> 00:24:44.274
Have you been well,
my lord?

00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:52.199
Good. You're here.

00:24:52.866 --> 00:24:55.244
The Gyeongsang merchants
use this map

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:58.205
whenever they need to travel
in the Geochang area.

00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:08.340
And this one,
Seocheon's landscape in detail.

00:25:08.424 --> 00:25:10.384
It shows the flood controls.

00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:11.802
It has wear and damage...

00:25:12.928 --> 00:25:14.847
but you should have no trouble
interpreting it.

00:25:18.017 --> 00:25:19.435
You did well.

00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:22.396
You're not at all interested?

00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:27.109
The reason why I commissioned these,
aren't you curious?

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:29.486
There is only one thing
a merchant cares for,

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.196
and that's how to make a profit.

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:34.366
Your reasons are no concern of mine,
my lord.

00:25:35.743 --> 00:25:36.744
Is that so?

00:25:38.912 --> 00:25:41.915
My lord, sorry to interrupt,
but the Assistant Officer

00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:44.376
from the Left Side Police Bureau is here.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.546
- From the Left, you say?
- What would you like me to do?

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.381
Bring him in.

00:25:52.843 --> 00:25:53.844
You should leave.

00:25:54.428 --> 00:25:56.638
Go out through the back gate,
just in case.

00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:59.475
Yes. Then I shall take my leave.

00:26:03.854 --> 00:26:04.855
Wait.

00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:12.196
I've heard that the Police Bureau
is blocking your salt trade.

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:14.656
- What?
- Be careful.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.533
They wouldn't do that without cause.

00:26:18.535 --> 00:26:20.788
If you need help dealing
with the Police Bureau...

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:24.041
I will do whatever I can.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.628
I appreciate it.

00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:49.441
The Police Bureau
is looking for missing horses?

00:26:49.525 --> 00:26:51.527
Yes, I'm following up on it.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:54.571
In the logbook, there are records
of you borrowing the horses.

00:26:54.655 --> 00:26:56.532
But there's no record of their return.

00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:59.076
Do you have any idea
whom you're addressing?

00:26:59.159 --> 00:27:01.120
Yes sir, you are Lord Yu Taeseok,

00:27:01.203 --> 00:27:03.372
maternal uncle to Princess Soho.

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:05.249
And Senior Guardian General
of the Commandant.

00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:06.959
Knowing all of that,

00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:10.212
you still came to see me.

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:14.049
I'm just following the evidence, my lord.
And the logbooks led me here.

00:27:14.758 --> 00:27:16.009
So you're saying

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.680
you believe the information
in the logbooks to be accurate?

00:27:19.763 --> 00:27:21.723
I have no reason not to.

00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:25.102
What kind of official
would fabricate records?

00:27:25.936 --> 00:27:26.937
That so?

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.440
The records indicate
you borrowed the horses.

00:27:30.524 --> 00:27:32.526
Yet you claim the logbooks are false.

00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:35.654
Only one of these things can be true.

00:27:35.737 --> 00:27:37.656
And that is why I am here.

00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:40.242
To ascertain the truth, my lord.

00:27:41.285 --> 00:27:44.329
What an upright
yet foolish official you are.

00:27:46.248 --> 00:27:47.708
My apologies.

00:27:50.043 --> 00:27:51.253
Your name, young man.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.505
My name is Jung Chun.

00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:57.217
Assistant Officer, Left Police Bureau.

00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:02.764
Well, Officer Jung, someone in
the Left Police Bureau is up to no good.

00:28:12.733 --> 00:28:14.776
- Let me pour you a drink.
- Ah.

00:28:15.611 --> 00:28:17.237
Now, this is the life.

00:28:17.321 --> 00:28:19.448
If we could just make
this time last forever,

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:22.034
- I couldn't ask for more, boss.
- Hey, boys.

00:28:22.576 --> 00:28:24.703
Let's make this our home
for a thousand years!

00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:26.872
We'll paint a mural
on the walls with our own shit!

00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:29.416
That's what I'm saying!

00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:31.376
Hey, boss, have you heard

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.794
- what's goin' around?
- What?

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:35.547
We're the talk of the town,
everyone's talking about us.

00:28:35.631 --> 00:28:37.132
What do they say?

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:38.884
Siyul, they're going crazy for him.

00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:43.263
How Brother Siyul fought Brother Deokgae
and... and whacked his face right off!

00:28:43.347 --> 00:28:45.223
Whole neighborhood is losing their minds!

00:28:45.307 --> 00:28:47.476
- Oh, it's great.
- Not only that,

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:48.936
he beat him all by himself.

00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:51.063
- He did it himself?
- Yes!

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.441
- Well? And?
- And?

00:28:54.524 --> 00:28:55.651
Anything else?

00:28:56.818 --> 00:29:00.197
I... I was the one who slashed
Deokgae's leg with a sickle!

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.741
I don't know. Haven't heard nothing.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.368
Impossible.

00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:10.999
Hey. If any of you need anything at all...

00:29:12.209 --> 00:29:14.419
- I'll take care of it.
- Yeah, right.

00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:17.381
I'm being serious!

00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:28.725
- Who? Me?
- Snap it.

00:29:31.478 --> 00:29:34.982
Look at this weakling. You'll break
your arm. Give me that. Give it here.

00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:38.360
- You're so pathetic.
- Oh, seriously?

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:40.612
Breaking a bunch like this isn't possible.

00:29:42.572 --> 00:29:45.117
See,
this is what family means.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.828
When we're together, nothing can break us.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.582
What kinda bullshit...

00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:53.834
He's right.

00:29:54.543 --> 00:29:55.961
That's what family is.

00:29:56.044 --> 00:29:59.006
- We eat together. We starve together.
- Huh.

00:29:59.089 --> 00:30:03.385
B... Brother Siyul. If that's the case,
can you teach me to fight?

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:05.804
Me, too. Teach me, too?

00:30:05.887 --> 00:30:09.266
A bandit's power comes from his fist.
I can't let anybody think we're weak!

00:30:09.349 --> 00:30:11.184
He's right. Now we have class after all!

00:30:21.737 --> 00:30:24.698
That sounds good.

00:30:25.866 --> 00:30:27.200
What do you want to learn?

00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:30.579
How about
a power technique? Huh?

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:32.622
Something that knocks
the enemy out in one blow.

00:30:32.706 --> 00:30:35.000
Like a wind blast, do you know that one?

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:36.835
Wind blast?

00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:39.504
I can't do a wind blast,

00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:41.590
but well, this is similar.

00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:53.518
Whoa, that's...

00:30:55.645 --> 00:30:56.897
- What the...
- It's stuck!

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.357
- That's incredible!
- That was amazing!

00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:01.777
- Teach me, teach me!
- How did you do that?

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.153
Teach me!

00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:08.116
Greet him properly!
This is Assistant Officer Lee Dolgae.

00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:10.035
Hurry up and bow.

00:31:15.457 --> 00:31:18.877
I heard the port has been turned
upside down 'cause of you.

00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:22.422
Seems it's true.

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:24.758
Your name, what is it?

00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:28.762
I'm just a bandit.

00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:31.056
I do not have one.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.476
You don't have one?

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:36.603
The Jang clan.

00:31:37.813 --> 00:31:40.482
That's what they say. The family Jang.

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:43.151
Yeah? The Jang clan?

00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:45.320
Yes.

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:49.282
If you want to survive this life,
then show etiquette.

00:31:49.825 --> 00:31:53.745
If you're too weak, you'll get trampled.
But if you're too strong, you'll snap.

00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:55.914
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:57.958
I'll keep that in mind.

00:31:58.041 --> 00:31:59.042
Then you may leave.

00:32:01.002 --> 00:32:02.045
Go, go.

00:32:07.551 --> 00:32:09.302
He's a sly fox.

00:32:10.137 --> 00:32:12.305
Even knows how to play tricks.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.641
How strange.

00:32:15.308 --> 00:32:17.602
Now, where did you find someone like that?

00:32:18.228 --> 00:32:21.857
It is all... all thanks to you, my lord.

00:32:26.403 --> 00:32:29.948
The second of the month. The meeting
of the thumbs is scheduled that day.

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:33.326
So now, it's time for you to be a thumb.

00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:35.203
Let's see how you do.

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:45.797
Thank you.

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:49.634
I'm grateful for your generosity.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.389
You know Wang Hae? Donghonaru's his now.

00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:57.267
Yes, I heard the rumors.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.103
Seems a war for the ports has started.

00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:03.273
And Mapo's already suffering casualties.

00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:08.403
Now that Deokgae's gone,
someone's bound to invade this place soon.

00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:11.656
How can you possibly handle this?

00:33:12.157 --> 00:33:14.826
That's too bad.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:17.162
You made thumb how long ago?

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.294
There it is.

00:33:24.377 --> 00:33:26.838
That priceless expression of panic.

00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:30.508
What?

00:33:31.218 --> 00:33:32.594
Do you want protection?

00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:34.387
My lord...

00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:37.265
do you have any specific orders for...

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:42.729
That's right. This is why

00:33:42.812 --> 00:33:44.940
I'm not sure I can ever hate you.

00:33:56.284 --> 00:33:57.827
You forget your manners?

00:33:58.912 --> 00:34:00.080
Do you need help?

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:01.539
Oh.

00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:05.585
That's right. Travel safe, my lord.

00:34:06.253 --> 00:34:07.837
Keep this in mind,

00:34:07.921 --> 00:34:10.590
your life is in my hands.

00:34:10.674 --> 00:34:12.342
I'm your angel of death.

00:34:13.343 --> 00:34:14.803
Oh. Of course.

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.311
Safe travels, my lord.

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:27.357
When there is a new thumb,

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.693
it is custom for the merchants
to pay him a visit.

00:34:29.776 --> 00:34:31.987
We pay our respects.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.489
This visit isn't just a custom.

00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:36.032
It's an excuse to rip us off.

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:39.035
This dock will change hands many times.

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:42.998
The merchants only have to act
according to the circumstance.

00:34:43.707 --> 00:34:44.708
Good day.

00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:47.877
Hello.

00:34:48.295 --> 00:34:51.673
Mudeok became a thumb
when he can't even take care of himself.

00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:54.134
It seems the world is turning upside down.

00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:57.512
- Does he even have what it takes?
- Who knows?

00:34:57.596 --> 00:35:00.515
Like putting lipstick on a pig.

00:35:02.017 --> 00:35:06.104
Oh, look, Chief Kang is here.

00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:08.023
I came to congratulate the new thumb.

00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:11.943
Ah. I look forward
to working together. Yeah.

00:35:12.027 --> 00:35:15.280
I'm sure I'll consult you often,
as partners in trade here.

00:35:15.363 --> 00:35:18.908
Wow, look at you! He makes it look easy.

00:35:18.992 --> 00:35:21.119
Bet there's so much for him
could teach us.

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:28.710
But you know, I don't really concern
myself with money or power, you see.

00:35:29.502 --> 00:35:33.006
If our town is good,
that's all I care about.

00:35:36.468 --> 00:35:38.720
You worked hard to get that seat.

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:42.682
Settle in it until the Three Ports wear
out. And live a long and healthy life.

00:35:42.766 --> 00:35:43.767
Sure.

00:35:44.934 --> 00:35:46.061
Here you are.

00:35:47.103 --> 00:35:50.398
- This is from our young leader.
- Whoa.

00:35:56.529 --> 00:36:00.033
It's a bit humble for a first greeting.

00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:08.833
Just joking.

00:36:10.919 --> 00:36:14.923
But what's this? The young leader
doesn't seem to appreciate my humor.

00:36:15.757 --> 00:36:18.843
A prickly attitude here
won't get you anything good from us.

00:36:19.969 --> 00:36:21.596
Please don't misunderstand her.

00:36:22.389 --> 00:36:24.349
She's not yet familiar with these customs.

00:36:25.392 --> 00:36:27.519
Whatever, not like I care
that much about that.

00:36:27.602 --> 00:36:31.147
It's a good day after all.

00:36:31.231 --> 00:36:32.982
Oh, hey, why don't we have a drink?

00:36:33.066 --> 00:36:34.734
- That's a great idea!
- I'll take one!

00:36:34.818 --> 00:36:37.529
Drink till we can't walk straight!

00:36:38.446 --> 00:36:41.616
If we are all finished up here,
I'll be taking my leave now.

00:36:42.158 --> 00:36:43.159
Eh?

00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:49.040
Well then.

00:36:50.458 --> 00:36:51.960
Go, go.

00:36:57.173 --> 00:36:58.466
Young leader!

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.886
Get filthy rich!

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:08.727
What the hell is that shit?

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.062
- Arrest everyone!
- Yes, sir.

00:37:11.521 --> 00:37:12.522
Oh!

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.400
Do not miss any of them.

00:37:15.483 --> 00:37:16.484
Yes, sir!

00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:44.596
Hey, Siyul. Siyul!

00:37:57.984 --> 00:38:00.069
- Let's go!
- Don't let anyone get away!

00:38:00.153 --> 00:38:01.404
Move, get out of here!

00:38:03.865 --> 00:38:04.866
Let's go!

00:38:09.662 --> 00:38:12.457
- Oh.
- You! Over here!

00:38:31.226 --> 00:38:33.520
Drag the ones that resist,
use force if necessary.

00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:50.328
Hit him!

00:39:16.604 --> 00:39:19.399
Snake!

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:25.029
There's a snake! There's a... snake.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.782
- Oh, there's a snake!
- On your knees!

00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:46.426
So, have you decided then?

00:39:47.093 --> 00:39:48.303
I go back to your words.

00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:51.514
You said you wanted Joseon
to be a good nation for all.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.391
I did.

00:39:53.474 --> 00:39:56.811
And that begins with the hearts
and lives of the commoners.

00:39:56.895 --> 00:39:58.438
They must be able to smile.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.773
I agree with you, my lord.

00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:03.735
Assistant Officer Jung.

00:40:03.818 --> 00:40:04.819
Yes.

00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:07.864
Half of the items going in
and out of the South Gate

00:40:07.947 --> 00:40:09.741
use the Gyeonggang River course.

00:40:11.659 --> 00:40:14.537
If you count it, the amount of money
that comes through there

00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:17.999
is 700,000 to a million nyang,
if not more.

00:40:19.459 --> 00:40:22.837
It is equivalent to the total amount
of silver the government has.

00:40:24.756 --> 00:40:27.926
The problem is, most of that money
is being siphoned off.

00:40:28.009 --> 00:40:29.385
Who's the money going to?

00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:33.139
- Do you suspect the officials?
- No.

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:36.517
Someone who sits higher.

00:40:37.185 --> 00:40:39.938
The hand at the top in the shadows
who's pulling the strings,

00:40:40.021 --> 00:40:43.191
controlling where it all goes.
You see, they're the one.

00:40:43.274 --> 00:40:45.610
That's who we have to root out and find.

00:40:45.693 --> 00:40:47.987
In that case, I'll hit the bandits first.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.199
You're going to kick the beehive?

00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:03.294
That's the fastest way to find the owner.

00:41:03.378 --> 00:41:04.879
And that's who matters.

00:41:12.637 --> 00:41:15.306
Officer Jung, you have
a rough journey ahead.

00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:29.737
Halt right there.

00:41:51.217 --> 00:41:53.970
You're an arrogant commoner,
to make such a big scene.

00:41:54.887 --> 00:41:56.639
Who said you could get arrested?

00:41:56.723 --> 00:41:58.307
Ooh...

00:41:58.808 --> 00:42:00.351
Do you acknowledge your wrongs?

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:04.522
Of course, my lord.

00:42:05.398 --> 00:42:07.984
I deeply, deeply regret it all.

00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:11.571
I'm going to reflect
on myself to do better.

00:42:15.283 --> 00:42:16.492
That will do then.

00:42:17.994 --> 00:42:20.705
You may leave,
just don't cause any more trouble.

00:42:21.456 --> 00:42:22.915
Be loyal to the country.

00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:25.168
Oh. Y... Yeah.

00:42:25.918 --> 00:42:26.919
Release them.

00:42:27.003 --> 00:42:29.213
These men are to remain in custody.

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:42.977
I told you about the dangers
of overreaching.

00:42:43.061 --> 00:42:44.729
And yet, you didn't listen.

00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:47.273
I stay in my lane, you stay in yours.

00:42:47.356 --> 00:42:49.192
I said you would be sorry, didn't I?

00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:52.070
You're a disgrace to the law.

00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:55.740
I'm trying to carry out my duty here.
And you're squabbling about lanes?

00:42:56.783 --> 00:42:58.993
Tie them back up and start marching!

00:42:59.077 --> 00:43:00.369
Don't you dare move.

00:43:01.329 --> 00:43:03.289
Did you know a letter
arrived the other day?

00:43:03.372 --> 00:43:06.125
You take bribes from bandits
in exchange for protection.

00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:10.546
Therefore, the general himself
has put out an order for your arrest.

00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:13.382
- Do you have evidence?
- Evidence?

00:43:15.176 --> 00:43:18.304
Coming up with that, that's light work.

00:43:19.388 --> 00:43:22.141
You can run wild
as long as I'm there to let you.

00:43:22.642 --> 00:43:25.061
There isn't a lot you can do
on your own, though.

00:43:26.813 --> 00:43:27.897
Ooh!

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.440
You're pathetic.

00:43:30.066 --> 00:43:33.319
You're no different from these bandits.

00:43:41.035 --> 00:43:42.995
- You bastards.
- What are you doing?

00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:46.332
Hurry up and arrest this man.
Throw him in a prison cell, now!

00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:47.500
Yes, sir.

00:43:53.798 --> 00:43:54.966
You bastards.

00:43:57.802 --> 00:43:59.762
Now you have a debt to pay.

00:43:59.846 --> 00:44:01.097
You'll pay, right?

00:44:02.223 --> 00:44:03.349
Yeah, yes.

00:44:04.016 --> 00:44:05.184
Of course.

00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:07.270
Then you may leave.

00:44:26.289 --> 00:44:27.290
See that?

00:44:28.457 --> 00:44:30.501
The order here isn't set by the king.

00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:33.171
Instead, it's that man.

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:36.549
Our lives are in Lee Dolgae's hands.

00:44:40.928 --> 00:44:44.682
And not just ours,
the life of your friend as well.

00:44:49.979 --> 00:44:53.191
- I heard all bandits were arrested.
- Yes, right on the spot.

00:44:53.274 --> 00:44:55.276
Then what is going
to happen to the dock now?

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:58.779
Yeah. Doesn't matter,
some other bandits will just take over.

00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:00.656
Are you saying they are all the same?

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.034
- Make way, make way!
- Hey! Move!

00:45:03.117 --> 00:45:05.995
- We're back!
- Make way, the boss is coming!

00:45:06.078 --> 00:45:07.830
- That's right! He's back!
- Make way!

00:45:07.914 --> 00:45:09.081
Hey! Get back to work!

00:45:09.165 --> 00:45:10.166
You miss us?

00:45:14.629 --> 00:45:15.755
Quit your staring!

A long, long time ago,

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.750
the 25th King of Silla,
King Jinji, was around.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.430
Though he was powerful,
he was also known for being a playboy.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.000
He once called a beauty, Dohwanyeo,
to enter the palace.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.150
But Dohwanyeo was married

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.870
and refused to marry the King.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.000
She said, "I can't serve two men."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.360
King Jinji asked, "What if
your husband doesn't exist anymore?"

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.640
Dohwanyeo closed her eyes

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.780
and nodded.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.480
With time,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.140
in a blink of an eye,
King Jinji passed away.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.510
Three years later,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.100
Dohwanyeo's husband died too.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.880
That night,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.160
the King that everyone thought was dead

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.670
turned into a ghost

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.620
and appeared in front of Dohwanyeo again.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.740
"I'm here to fulfill my promise."

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.080
For seven days and nights,
they shared the same room.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.050
It's said that the five-colored clouds
surrounded their roof every night.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.250
A rare fragrance filled the room—

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.539
it wasn't the scent of humans, it was
a mix of the world's essence and moisture.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.780
Soon, Dohwanyeo got pregnant,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.479
and she gave birth to a son.

You've never seen one before
yet you say their farts stink?

Well, thank you so much.

Goblins don't have horns.

Huh?

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.900
I've never worn things
like this before, too.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.890
Please at least make sure
it's factually accurate.

Don't act as something you don't know,
embarrassing goblins.

Stand right here. I'll teach you.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.920
I'm good at acting as one.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.210
What?

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.670
Acting as someone getting beaten up?

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.730
Tsk, tsk.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.500
You've never even seen my acting.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.240
I'll make sure you see me on TV
in the future,

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.130
so live a long life!

Hey.

I think there's a misunderstanding.

I'm going to beat you up!

You're going to beat me up,
how could I stop?

I'm sorry.

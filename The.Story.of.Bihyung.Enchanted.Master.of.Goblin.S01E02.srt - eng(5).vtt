00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.830
Bihyung was birthed
by a human and a ghost.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.430
He's the one who can dispatch goblins,

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.070
and even ghosts fear him.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.190
The king of goblins, Bihyung.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.600
Bihyung, though powerful,
has a fatal weakness.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.350
A goblin

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.780
is only complete with a master
that would call on it.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.160
Yet Bihyung's master

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.630
left him alone and disappeared.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.750
What's worse is that

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.920
goblins need the essence from humans.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.750
But because of Bihyung's unique physique,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.990
he is unable to absorb essences.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.120
For thousands of years,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.480
he had no master nor energy.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.710
In the endless hunger, desire,
and loneliness,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.930
Bihyung needs to live with a firm mind.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.200
He was once a king,
but he was no longer a king.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.039
He was a ghost,
but he was no longer a ghost.

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.990
He was once a human,
but he was no longer a human.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.750
This half-baked goblin

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.140
is called Bihyung.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.710
This goblin that is unable to
become complete's despair

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.380
begins now.

until you find one.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.720
It's not long before the 16th.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.600
Didn't you say

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.560
that I only have one master.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.360
Maybe I've been destined to be over
since that day.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.320
Who knows?

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.300
Maybe the heavens
will give you another master.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.730
I'm sick of hearing that.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.080
Bye.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.860
Are you here alone?

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.790
If you don't mind—

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.140
I'm meeting someone.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.570
We don't usually make the first move.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.450
But you're so handsome.
Can you give me your phone number...

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.950
Don't touch me.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.300
What the heck?

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.070
It's getting worse.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.010
I'm sick of this.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.520
Are you okay?

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.950
Get lost!

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.260
I'm willing to give myself
to you who found me.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.060
From now on, you are my master.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.670
My master.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.430
It must be a coincidence.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.280
There aren't that many days left
till the 16th.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.340
Yet evil spirits like this
are still wandering around.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.290
Why do you keep following me?

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:09.480
Seriously?

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.540
I'm going in the same direction as you.
What else can I do?

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.819
You kept staring at me too,

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:15.720
making me feel uncomfortable.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.680
Why do you keep treating me
like I'm a criminal?

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.050
Th-That's not it.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.460
Then go ahead first.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.170
Darn it.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.069
You crazy bitch! Shut up and follow me—

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.740
My body...

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.410
Are you curious?

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:48.100
Why I can see through you?

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.010
Because only you

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.020
can see me.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:17:59.980
Since then,

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.740
[Wanted Suspect]

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.480
it has always been you.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.480
My prey.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.790
I-I'm sorry.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.990
Let's go!

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.960
Let's go!

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.580
Save me...

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.320
Goblin?

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.130
Just an evil spirit.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.930
Seems like you're hiding

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.880
something interesting.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.230
Don't cross the line and get lost.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.900
The trash made by humans
should be cleaned up by humans.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.640
Gildal?

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.160
Just be mine.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.320
What?

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.100
There's no free lunch in this world.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.080
Pay it back with your body.

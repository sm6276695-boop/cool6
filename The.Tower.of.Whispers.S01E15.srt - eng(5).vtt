00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.750
with the intention to ease your burdens.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.150
Ease my burdens?

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.750
Read it yourself.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.850
Read what they've written.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.150
You all read it, didn't you?

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.000
Look.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.200
Read it to him!

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.750
You!

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.750
Read it!

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.480
Your Majesty!

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.080
You!

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.720
Read it to him!

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:21.960
You...

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.840
You're a bunch of useless cowards!

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.440
Your Majesty, they dare not read it.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:29.480
I dare.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.750
Jun Ze, the Eldest Prince,

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.440
abused his royal favor

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.270
and has committed numerous crimes.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.840
For his personal gain,

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.640
he forcibly seized farmlands,

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.630
making countless citizens
become homeless.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.630
He suppressed loyal officials,

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.720
and blocked honest counsel,

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.790
causing panic throughout the court.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.720
What's worse,

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.670
he has imprisoned the top three scholars

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.550
in his residence

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.360
to write false political essays for him.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.910
Their years of diligent study

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.670
have become his fame-seeking tools.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.000
Such behavior

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.240
defies heaven's law

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.600
and angers both gods and men.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.530
Lu Yang, you're talking nonsense!

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.910
Father, I did none of these things.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.550
He's slandering me!

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.600
Shut up!

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.240
Father.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.390
Lu Yang.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.510
You know the consequences of

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.320
slandering the Crown Prince, right?

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.750
I understand, Your Majesty.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.200
I am willing to die,

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.390
hoping my blood will summon thunder

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.630
to restore justice

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.200
to the people!

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.840
Very well.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.670
You dare prove your sincerity
with death.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.240
I believe you will investigate thoroughly.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.000
Trust Lord Lu.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.720
Yes.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.690
Thank you, Father.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.440
I beg you to uncover the truth

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.510
and clear my name.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.270
Wait!

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.030
I don't think
an investigation is necessary.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.360
I have evidence of his crimes.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.000
Who is that?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.840
I don't know.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.150
How could he have evidence?

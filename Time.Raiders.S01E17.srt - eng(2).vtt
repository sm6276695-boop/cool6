00:01:54.826 --> 00:01:55.586
Wu.

00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:58.746
Tell me.

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:00.946
Where did this hole come from?

00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:06.225
If I'm thinking it right,

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:09.065
it should be

00:02:10.426 --> 00:02:11.545
- Xie Lianhuan.
- Xie Lianhuan.

00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:17.225
This guy's unbelievable.

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:20.785
He must be a reincarnated pangolin.

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:23.345
If he had enough time,

00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:27.026
could he dig a tunnel to Antarctica?

00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:33.825
What was that just now?

00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:38.306
It's like an unseasoned
squirrel mandarin fish.

00:02:40.105 --> 00:02:41.586
That is the sea monkey.

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:44.345
That's the sea monkey?

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:49.785
I thought you were lying before.

00:02:50.426 --> 00:02:51.345
It really exists.

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:54.186
Wang Zanghai

00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:56.146
is so twisted.

00:02:57.225 --> 00:02:58.785
He's like a zookeeper of monsters,

00:02:59.426 --> 00:03:01.026
raising all kinds of weird creatures.

00:03:01.225 --> 00:03:02.866
First sea monkeys, then Forbidden Woman,

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:05.706
and then white-haired monsters.

00:03:07.026 --> 00:03:08.586
Was he holding a party on this ship?

00:03:10.785 --> 00:03:11.825
Where'd he get them all?

00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:13.385
Poison.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:14.545
What?

00:03:23.746 --> 00:03:25.345
Remember the white hair on your back?

00:03:31.146 --> 00:03:32.466
Stop scaring me, okay?

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:33.866
I'm already terrified.

00:03:34.306 --> 00:03:35.945
Didn't you say the white hair was fine?

00:03:37.986 --> 00:03:38.986
What's going on?

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:42.746
Could the Lotus Arrows be the problem,

00:03:42.906 --> 00:03:44.385
making people white-haired monsters?

00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:46.866
No wonder those arrows weren't lethal.

00:03:47.986 --> 00:03:49.345
Don't scare me, Wu.

00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:50.266
I'm a coward.

00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:53.306
Will I become a white-haired monster?

00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:55.026
I won't end up like that, right?

00:03:56.065 --> 00:03:57.266
Just wild guesses.

00:03:58.186 --> 00:03:59.466
I was hit by arrows too.

00:03:59.466 --> 00:04:00.586
Does that mean I'm poisoned?

00:04:01.026 --> 00:04:02.065
Cut the crap.

00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:03.385
I found it long ago

00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:04.665
that you're built differently.

00:04:05.866 --> 00:04:06.785
I found it last time

00:04:07.345 --> 00:04:08.746
at the King of Lu's kiln.

00:04:08.746 --> 00:04:09.906
Young Third Master!

00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:11.545
Da Kui!

00:04:11.746 --> 00:04:13.426
Da Kui saved you back then,

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:14.864
and you're still fine.

00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:18.826
Xiaoge,

00:04:19.706 --> 00:04:20.946
what am I supposed to do?

00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:23.586
Are you still itching?

00:04:26.345 --> 00:04:28.305
My whole back's numb now.

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:29.665
I can't feel a thing.

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:31.826
I don't know if it's pain-numb,
sore-numb,

00:04:31.826 --> 00:04:32.745
or itch-numb.

00:04:32.745 --> 00:04:33.906
It's just completely numb.

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:35.665
Wait.

00:04:36.146 --> 00:04:38.865
Why didn't you say
it was this serious earlier?

00:04:40.906 --> 00:04:41.985
It wouldn't have helped.

00:04:42.506 --> 00:04:44.545
Then why tell me now?

00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:46.865
Now I feel worse.

00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:48.946
Think of something.

00:04:49.785 --> 00:04:51.586
There are no better solutions here.

00:04:52.466 --> 00:04:54.626
It means we can't fix it here.

00:04:54.706 --> 00:04:56.345
But we might find a solution outside.

00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:58.626
So we need to get out fast.

00:04:59.185 --> 00:04:59.626
Right.

00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:00.745
Right, right!

00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:03.466
Find a way out,

00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:05.105
and get to a hospital.

00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:09.785
What are you doing?

00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:12.506
This thing is creepy.
It needs better locks.

00:05:12.506 --> 00:05:13.626
Just in case.

00:05:14.026 --> 00:05:15.665
Don't bother with it. It's already...

00:05:17.425 --> 00:05:18.745
Xiaoge, what're you looking at?

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.672
This is Heavenly Palace on the Clouds.

00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:48.745
Heavenly Palace on the Clouds?

00:07:01.826 --> 00:07:04.545
This truly an ancient LEGO architecture.

00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:10.946
So intricate.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:16.105
Even the LEGO version
is of this grandeur.

00:07:18.225 --> 00:07:20.066
What's the real thing look like?

00:07:22.865 --> 00:07:24.665
Where could it be?

00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:28.466
Could it actually be on the clouds?

00:07:30.026 --> 00:07:31.745
Enough with the nonsense.

00:07:32.305 --> 00:07:33.826
You're corrupting Xiaoge.

00:07:33.826 --> 00:07:34.985
Corrupting?

00:07:35.066 --> 00:07:36.665
Xiaoge's developing a sense of humor,

00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:37.466
right?

00:07:37.466 --> 00:07:38.626
Shouldn't we be happy?

00:07:39.026 --> 00:07:39.826
Right, Xiaoge?

00:07:41.185 --> 00:07:42.105
Is this about me?

00:07:43.626 --> 00:07:44.506
What you looking at?

00:07:46.985 --> 00:07:48.545
How is there beef jerky here?

00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:51.626
Wang Zanghai.

00:07:54.146 --> 00:07:54.946
Wang Zanghai?

00:08:01.506 --> 00:08:02.665
This is a specimen?

00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:08.906
His fingernails need trimming.

00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:27.146
So, Xiaoge?

00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:28.506
Found anything?

00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:31.056
Something in his stomach.

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:34.705
He was quite the glutton.

00:08:34.705 --> 00:08:35.746
He even died stuffed.

00:08:36.226 --> 00:08:37.106
Cut the nonsense.

00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:39.386
He hid something

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:41.386
in his own stomach before dying.

00:08:41.705 --> 00:08:43.465
That means it's extremely important.

00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:48.386
It might be crucial to everything here.

00:08:49.065 --> 00:08:50.026
What could it be?

00:08:50.146 --> 00:08:51.425
A stinking turd.

00:08:51.986 --> 00:08:53.026
Crucial or not,

00:08:53.026 --> 00:08:54.665
I don't have a third eye.

00:08:55.425 --> 00:08:57.026
How could I see through this?

00:08:57.506 --> 00:08:59.465
You said it must be important yourself.

00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:00.746
Do you remember

00:09:00.944 --> 00:09:03.386
the corpse with a key
in her mouth at the King of Lu's kiln?

00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:04.185
Yes.

00:09:04.866 --> 00:09:05.866
What about it?

00:09:07.626 --> 00:09:09.425
If this really is Wang Zanghai,

00:09:10.346 --> 00:09:12.106
who knew countless secret mechanisms,

00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:15.106
the thing in his stomach

00:09:15.106 --> 00:09:16.506
must be more dangerous.

00:09:18.386 --> 00:09:19.705
That makes sense.

00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:22.305
So what should we do?

00:09:22.465 --> 00:09:24.185
Time's running tight.

00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:25.026
Shall we bail now?

00:09:25.906 --> 00:09:26.705
Let's go.

00:09:27.065 --> 00:09:27.746
Come on, Xiaoge.

00:09:33.746 --> 00:09:34.626
W-Wait.

00:09:34.626 --> 00:09:36.185
W-What are you doing?

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:41.266
What's this about?

00:09:42.425 --> 00:09:43.185
I don't know.

00:09:53.585 --> 00:09:55.465
He seemed to smile.

00:10:38.465 --> 00:10:39.346
This is...

00:10:41.945 --> 00:10:42.746
Luminous pearls.

00:10:47.545 --> 00:10:48.785
Oh, my!

00:10:49.305 --> 00:10:51.346
There are so many!

00:11:02.506 --> 00:11:03.506
What's this?

00:11:18.506 --> 00:11:19.305
Wu,

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.825
doesn't this mural

00:11:22.425 --> 00:11:23.746
look different

00:11:23.746 --> 00:11:24.945
from what we saw up there?

00:11:37.425 --> 00:11:38.185
It's true.

00:11:39.226 --> 00:11:41.065
The mural shows different content

00:11:42.185 --> 00:11:43.465
from various angles.

00:11:46.465 --> 00:11:47.465
Do you know why?

00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:55.425
This is called a shadow mural.

00:11:55.785 --> 00:11:56.626
The lighting

00:11:56.626 --> 00:11:58.506
was specially designed this way.

00:11:58.866 --> 00:12:00.465
Different light angles

00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:03.825
create varying images from this diagram.

00:12:04.465 --> 00:12:06.785
It should also be a narrative mural.

00:12:07.785 --> 00:12:09.825
The central part here must be...

00:12:10.305 --> 00:12:11.506
Heavenly Palace on the Clouds.

00:12:14.465 --> 00:12:15.906
Heavenly Palace on the Clouds

00:12:16.386 --> 00:12:17.986
when first completed.

00:12:19.506 --> 00:12:21.305
The so-called
Heavenly Palace on the Clouds

00:12:21.305 --> 00:12:24.065
was actually built
on an extremely high mountain peak,

00:12:24.465 --> 00:12:25.585
wrapped in clouds

00:12:26.026 --> 00:12:28.825
to create an illusion
of floating above the clouds.

00:12:29.906 --> 00:12:31.945
Why does this place look so familiar?

00:12:35.026 --> 00:12:36.746
It resembles
the Three Saints Snow Mountain.

00:12:38.986 --> 00:12:41.626
Could Heavenly Palace on the Clouds
be located

00:12:41.626 --> 00:12:44.585
on Three Saints Snow Mountain?

00:13:10.065 --> 00:13:11.185
Let's check other parts.

00:13:20.906 --> 00:13:23.465
It's quite a high-standard procession.

00:13:25.945 --> 00:13:27.585
It's comparable to a ruler's, isn't it?

00:13:28.585 --> 00:13:30.106
Who could be this important?

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.425
Judging by the attire,

00:13:34.705 --> 00:13:36.065
it appears northern in style.

00:13:37.106 --> 00:13:39.065
It seems the Heavenly Palace's master

00:13:39.065 --> 00:13:40.705
was a northern noble.

00:13:41.705 --> 00:13:43.506
Rulers build palaces on land,

00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:44.705
but this master

00:13:44.705 --> 00:13:46.425
built his on the clouds.

00:13:47.305 --> 00:13:49.065
He considered himself

00:13:49.065 --> 00:13:50.305
above rulers.

00:13:52.386 --> 00:13:54.626
I don't know whether his status
was higher or not.

00:13:55.465 --> 00:13:56.346
But look.

00:13:56.906 --> 00:13:58.146
Nearly all females here.

00:14:00.785 --> 00:14:02.986
Is this a women's kingdom?

00:14:24.945 --> 00:14:26.785
Let me finish singing.

00:14:26.906 --> 00:14:28.386
Why so much chatter?

00:14:45.585 --> 00:14:46.746
It's stranger here.

00:14:49.026 --> 00:14:51.785
Why they burned the plank path?

00:14:51.866 --> 00:14:53.200
It took much effort to build it.

00:14:54.386 --> 00:14:55.346
It was probably

00:14:55.346 --> 00:14:57.785
to prevent outsiders
from damaging the Heavenly Palace.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:14:58.906
Why is that?

00:14:59.945 --> 00:15:01.465
By destroying the only plank path,

00:15:01.705 --> 00:15:02.986
outsiders can't get in.

00:15:03.065 --> 00:15:04.545
But insiders couldn't leave either.

00:15:10.305 --> 00:15:11.425
Finish the story!

00:15:15.626 --> 00:15:16.665
I get it now.

00:15:16.906 --> 00:15:18.096
The fire caused an avalanche

00:15:18.305 --> 00:15:19.986
that buried the entire Heavenly Palace,

00:15:20.226 --> 00:15:23.106
along with all the procession members.

00:15:23.386 --> 00:15:26.026
Before the world laid eyes on it,

00:15:26.266 --> 00:15:28.146
it became a legend.

00:15:28.906 --> 00:15:29.986
That was brutal.

00:15:32.945 --> 00:15:34.825
Then why did he create so many murals

00:15:34.825 --> 00:15:36.305
to document all this?

00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:38.146
He still held resentment about this.

00:15:39.825 --> 00:15:40.785
You mean...

00:15:45.746 --> 00:15:46.626
Wang Zanghai.

00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:56.305
He built such a grand Heavenly Palace,

00:15:56.825 --> 00:15:58.305
but never got to admire it himself,

00:15:58.626 --> 00:15:59.825
before it was buried by snow.

00:16:00.945 --> 00:16:02.626
Imagine how bitter he must have felt.

00:16:03.785 --> 00:16:05.906
That's why he preserved it this way

00:16:06.825 --> 00:16:07.986
and sank it to the seabed.

00:16:08.705 --> 00:16:10.705
It's specifically for people like us

00:16:10.705 --> 00:16:12.825
who could discover it to witness.

00:16:13.665 --> 00:16:15.506
The one who ordered him
to build this palace

00:16:15.506 --> 00:16:17.065
must have held immense power

00:16:17.465 --> 00:16:18.425
and prominent status.

00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:20.506
That's why he couldn't

00:16:20.506 --> 00:16:22.226
show this masterpiece to the world.

00:16:22.465 --> 00:16:25.146
But given Wang Zanghai's
boastful nature,

00:16:25.906 --> 00:16:27.665
he needed future generations to see

00:16:28.305 --> 00:16:29.585
and acknowledge

00:16:30.386 --> 00:16:32.146
that among all his creations,

00:16:32.506 --> 00:16:35.986
there existed such a magnificent work.

00:16:45.866 --> 00:16:46.945
What is this?

00:16:46.945 --> 00:16:48.106
Why are the lights dimming

00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:50.256
when we guessed correctly?

00:16:53.305 --> 00:16:54.106
Where's Xiaoge?

00:16:55.945 --> 00:16:56.785
Xiaoge!

00:16:58.305 --> 00:16:59.746
Oh, no. We lost him.

00:17:00.146 --> 00:17:00.945
Xiaoge!

00:17:06.465 --> 00:17:07.306
Xiaoge!

00:17:09.866 --> 00:17:10.665
Xiaoge!

00:17:13.786 --> 00:17:14.586
Xiaoge!

00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:16.465
Xiaoge!

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:19.225
Xiao...

00:17:20.866 --> 00:17:22.025
Well...

00:17:22.465 --> 00:17:24.386
We've been searching everywhere for you,

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:25.586
and here you are,

00:17:25.826 --> 00:17:27.665
striking poses in front of a mirror?

00:17:27.945 --> 00:17:28.906
What's wrong?

00:17:28.906 --> 00:17:29.866
Why?

00:17:30.866 --> 00:17:32.016
There's a hole behind this.

00:17:38.745 --> 00:17:39.945
How can you tell?

00:17:42.505 --> 00:17:43.465
Move it aside.

00:17:57.705 --> 00:17:58.906
Impressive.

00:17:59.265 --> 00:18:00.626
You've got X-ray vision?

00:18:17.586 --> 00:18:18.786
I've been here before.

00:18:21.866 --> 00:18:24.505
So what memories surfaced?

00:18:24.705 --> 00:18:26.306
This is where we entered back then,

00:18:27.066 --> 00:18:28.826
got drugged, and lost all consciousness.

00:18:29.786 --> 00:18:31.025
I need to enter again.

00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:32.265
No.

00:18:35.626 --> 00:18:36.985
You believe

00:18:36.985 --> 00:18:38.826
Third Uncle drugged you back then.

00:18:39.945 --> 00:18:40.745
But

00:18:41.346 --> 00:18:42.025
I don't think

00:18:42.025 --> 00:18:43.906
he had the capability
to erase your memories.

00:18:44.586 --> 00:18:45.465
Have you considered

00:18:46.265 --> 00:18:48.265
what if you lose your memories

00:18:48.985 --> 00:18:49.786
again inside?

00:18:52.826 --> 00:18:53.866
To you all,

00:18:54.786 --> 00:18:56.945
this is just another bizarre adventure.

00:18:57.745 --> 00:18:58.826
But for me,

00:18:59.185 --> 00:19:00.786
it's an unsolvable knot.

00:19:02.306 --> 00:19:03.705
I might lose my memories again.

00:19:04.985 --> 00:19:06.826
So I must keep chasing the truth.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:08.386
Valid point.

00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:11.225
I do understand you,

00:19:11.586 --> 00:19:12.705
but even if you go in

00:19:12.705 --> 00:19:14.705
and uncover every secret, what then?

00:19:15.705 --> 00:19:16.745
When the oxygen runs out

00:19:16.745 --> 00:19:17.546
and we all

00:19:17.546 --> 00:19:18.705
suffocate here,

00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:19.665
what's next?

00:19:19.866 --> 00:19:21.705
All secrets will become worthless.

00:19:22.265 --> 00:19:23.146
Also valid.

00:19:25.025 --> 00:19:26.225
So what are our chances

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:28.066
of getting out?

00:19:31.265 --> 00:19:32.225
We've climbed upward

00:19:32.745 --> 00:19:33.465
about ten meters

00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:35.265
since entering this structure.

00:19:36.586 --> 00:19:38.106
This shipwreck couldn't be this tall.

00:19:38.265 --> 00:19:39.626
We must be at the ceiling now.

00:19:40.185 --> 00:19:41.945
We just need to make a hole
in the ceiling

00:19:41.945 --> 00:19:43.066
when the tide goes out.

00:19:44.265 --> 00:19:46.146
That way, we'll likely
escape through there.

00:19:46.586 --> 00:19:47.906
The odds are good.

00:19:48.945 --> 00:19:49.745
However,

00:19:51.306 --> 00:19:52.306
once seawater rushes in,

00:19:52.705 --> 00:19:54.546
the entire wreck will flood.

00:19:55.225 --> 00:19:56.185
But don't worry,

00:19:56.465 --> 00:19:57.745
the site itself won't disappear.

00:19:57.866 --> 00:19:59.225
Just the wreck being submerged.

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:01.106
We can return better equipped

00:20:01.106 --> 00:20:01.985
in a few days.

00:20:02.386 --> 00:20:03.985
His plan sounds more valid.

00:20:04.106 --> 00:20:05.066
And the crucial point is

00:20:05.066 --> 00:20:06.386
we're truly running out of time.

00:20:06.586 --> 00:20:08.866
Xiaoge, you need
to listen to us this time.

00:20:09.225 --> 00:20:10.265
This time around,

00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:13.386
let's first find tools
to make a hole in it.

00:20:14.106 --> 00:20:15.945
I think the sealing of this shipwreck

00:20:16.786 --> 00:20:17.945
was quite well-done.

00:20:18.265 --> 00:20:19.665
No leaks after all these years.

00:20:20.106 --> 00:20:21.386
It must be a massive project.

00:20:23.705 --> 00:20:24.745
Actions speak louder.

00:20:25.665 --> 00:20:27.306
Let's go find tools.

00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:32.306
What should we use?

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:34.945
Use this.

00:20:44.146 --> 00:20:44.826
Xiaoge,

00:20:44.985 --> 00:20:46.306
I need to discuss three things.

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:49.146
First, don't suddenly disappear anymore.

00:20:49.505 --> 00:20:51.146
Second, stop striking poses.

00:20:51.465 --> 00:20:53.906
Third, quit showing off, okay?

00:21:33.745 --> 00:21:34.586
Xiaoge!

00:21:34.945 --> 00:21:35.786
Xiaoge!

00:21:35.945 --> 00:21:37.025
Hey! Wait for me!

00:21:41.306 --> 00:21:42.106
Wu Xie!

00:21:44.225 --> 00:21:45.066
Wu Xie!

00:21:52.546 --> 00:21:53.386
Wu Xie!

00:22:03.826 --> 00:22:04.626
What's wrong?

00:22:10.346 --> 00:22:11.106
Third Uncle.

00:22:13.106 --> 00:22:14.665
Third Uncle. Third Uncle!

00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:16.386
Third Uncle?

00:22:16.386 --> 00:22:17.745
Stay back! Stay back!

00:22:18.465 --> 00:22:19.425
Stay back!

00:22:19.425 --> 00:22:20.306
Still trying to run?

00:22:20.306 --> 00:22:21.066
Stay back!

00:22:21.066 --> 00:22:21.705
Stop there!

00:22:22.185 --> 00:22:22.906
Just stay down.

00:22:23.146 --> 00:22:24.705
I've been chasing you this whole way.

00:22:24.826 --> 00:22:26.146
I saved this arrow for you.

00:22:26.505 --> 00:22:27.786
Wu Sanxing, stay back!

00:22:27.786 --> 00:22:28.306
Stay back!

00:22:28.306 --> 00:22:28.784
Wu Sanxing?

00:22:28.945 --> 00:22:29.626
Wu Sanxing.

00:22:30.306 --> 00:22:31.546
You know where Third Uncle is?

00:22:31.546 --> 00:22:32.705
Do you know Third Uncle?

00:22:33.106 --> 00:22:33.985
Tell me!

00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:35.225
Tell me where Third Uncle is!

00:22:35.225 --> 00:22:36.225
Where's my Third Uncle?

00:22:36.225 --> 00:22:36.665
Stay back!

00:22:36.665 --> 00:22:37.586
Wu.

00:22:38.386 --> 00:22:39.985
Can't you see she's not right?

00:23:12.705 --> 00:23:13.505
Xiaoge.

00:23:14.185 --> 00:23:15.265
Don't you think

00:23:18.066 --> 00:23:19.386
she's possessed or something?

00:23:20.826 --> 00:23:22.505
She's probably triggered by something.

00:23:23.866 --> 00:23:25.386
Could she be faking it?

00:23:26.985 --> 00:23:28.106
There's an old saying

00:23:29.705 --> 00:23:32.626
that the worst poison
comes from big-eared traitors.

00:23:34.866 --> 00:23:35.665
So...

00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:36.665
Wu Xie!

00:23:38.906 --> 00:23:39.505
Wait.

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:41.546
Have you no mercy for delicate women?

00:23:41.826 --> 00:23:43.265
What do we do now?

00:23:51.985 --> 00:23:52.906
Listen.

00:23:54.586 --> 00:23:56.185
The flashlight's broken too.

00:23:57.066 --> 00:23:58.665
Show some concern for me, okay?

00:23:59.665 --> 00:24:01.586
Could you come carry a bag at least?

00:24:03.866 --> 00:24:05.025
Unbelievable.

00:24:05.665 --> 00:24:06.505
Have you considered

00:24:06.505 --> 00:24:07.826
this place would be so sinister?

00:24:08.945 --> 00:24:10.185
We don't have much time left.

00:24:10.185 --> 00:24:11.546
Maybe we should turn back.

00:24:13.626 --> 00:24:14.505
What's this?

00:24:19.505 --> 00:24:22.025
Is this a giant coral or a tree?

00:24:22.306 --> 00:24:23.546
Or a coral tree?

00:24:29.025 --> 00:24:30.705
I'll give you some friendly reminders.

00:24:31.306 --> 00:24:32.146
First,

00:24:32.465 --> 00:24:33.665
the things ahead are unknown.

00:24:33.665 --> 00:24:35.826
They're likely connected
to Ning's collapse.

00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:37.185
Second,

00:24:37.425 --> 00:24:38.826
our time is really running out.

00:24:39.505 --> 00:24:40.906
Are you sure about going deeper?

00:24:42.225 --> 00:24:43.185
And third...

00:24:44.745 --> 00:24:46.786
Stay close. Don't fall behind.

00:24:50.665 --> 00:24:51.505
Perfect.

00:24:52.906 --> 00:24:54.826
The third one is
they'll never let you leave.

00:24:55.066 --> 00:24:56.066
I knew it.

00:25:00.546 --> 00:25:01.665
Slow down a bit.

00:25:01.665 --> 00:25:02.826
Thank goodness she's slim.

00:25:04.786 --> 00:25:06.066
What did I tell you?

00:25:06.586 --> 00:25:08.066
Isn't it just a coral tree?

00:25:15.665 --> 00:25:17.586
Isn't it th-that thing?

00:25:18.505 --> 00:25:19.265
Looks familiar.

00:25:19.265 --> 00:25:19.906
Don't touch it.

00:25:20.066 --> 00:25:21.168
These are hexagonal bells.

00:25:23.185 --> 00:25:24.346
I know.

00:25:25.386 --> 00:25:27.505
Aren't these in the skull
of the Green-Eyed Fox Corpse

00:25:27.505 --> 00:25:28.745
in the King of Lu's kiln?

00:25:29.505 --> 00:25:30.505
Why are they here?

00:25:30.505 --> 00:25:31.346
And so many of them.

00:25:33.505 --> 00:25:34.346
Hey, girl.

00:25:34.346 --> 00:25:35.985
Did you touch these earlier

00:25:35.985 --> 00:25:37.106
and became like this?

00:25:38.425 --> 00:25:39.106
It's not right.

00:25:40.985 --> 00:25:42.306
Could Wang Zanghai take them

00:25:42.465 --> 00:25:43.505
from King Shang of Lu?

00:25:44.705 --> 00:25:45.906
What kind of person

00:25:45.906 --> 00:25:47.306
was Wang Zanghai?

00:25:48.745 --> 00:25:50.512
He served
in the Imperial Astronomy Bureau.

00:25:50.665 --> 00:25:51.786
Except for fengshui,

00:25:52.346 --> 00:25:54.386
he was also in charge
of building the imperial tomb.

00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:56.346
He was best at catching tomb raiders.

00:25:56.826 --> 00:25:57.866
Isn't Wang Zanghai

00:25:57.866 --> 00:25:59.786
the owner of this shipwreck?

00:26:00.786 --> 00:26:02.586
Maybe during an official mission,

00:26:02.665 --> 00:26:03.984
he visited the King of Lu's kiln.

00:26:05.306 --> 00:26:06.225
Third Uncle?

00:26:06.225 --> 00:26:07.786
And replicated this here?

00:26:21.826 --> 00:26:22.665
Wu Xie!

00:26:29.185 --> 00:26:30.505
Oh, no!

00:26:30.626 --> 00:26:31.306
Xiaoge,

00:26:31.306 --> 00:26:31.945
Wu Xie.

00:26:31.945 --> 00:26:32.465
No time.

00:26:32.465 --> 00:26:32.866
Run!

00:26:32.866 --> 00:26:33.386
Run!

00:26:33.386 --> 00:26:33.985
Hurry!

00:26:49.505 --> 00:26:50.106
Wu.

00:26:50.705 --> 00:26:51.546
Wu Xie.

00:26:55.185 --> 00:26:55.945
Something's wrong.

00:26:56.346 --> 00:26:57.185
Something's wrong.

00:26:58.985 --> 00:26:59.665
Something's off.

00:26:59.985 --> 00:27:01.146
Absolutely not right.

00:27:02.346 --> 00:27:02.945
Wu.

00:27:06.146 --> 00:27:06.906
What's wrong?

00:27:07.106 --> 00:27:08.306
What's happening to me?

00:27:09.265 --> 00:27:10.465
Why am I panting so hard

00:27:10.745 --> 00:27:11.945
just carrying her?

00:27:12.106 --> 00:27:13.465
Am I falling for her?

00:27:15.866 --> 00:27:17.346
My heart's racing way too fast.

00:27:17.465 --> 00:27:18.465
Stop your moaning.

00:27:18.465 --> 00:27:19.866
Your moaning's making me pant.

00:27:19.866 --> 00:27:20.866
I'm not lying.

00:27:20.866 --> 00:27:22.346
We're running out of oxygen.

00:27:22.906 --> 00:27:23.705
What?

00:27:24.546 --> 00:27:25.745
No oxygen left?

00:27:28.505 --> 00:27:29.306
Ning.

00:27:29.306 --> 00:27:31.265
Ning's bag has the oxygen gauge.

00:27:32.185 --> 00:27:33.066
Let me check.

00:27:37.546 --> 00:27:38.346
How is it?

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:40.705
How is it?

00:27:41.306 --> 00:27:42.225
Twenty minutes.

00:27:42.225 --> 00:27:42.866
What?

00:27:43.386 --> 00:27:44.745
Only twenty minutes left.

00:27:46.066 --> 00:27:47.465
Quick! Quick!

00:27:54.826 --> 00:27:56.425
Wu, find tools.

00:27:56.626 --> 00:27:57.066
Hurry!

00:27:57.906 --> 00:27:58.665
Wu.

00:27:59.626 --> 00:28:00.425
Find tools.

00:28:01.225 --> 00:28:02.146
Go find tools.

00:28:02.265 --> 00:28:03.185
Didn't you say so?

00:28:03.626 --> 00:28:04.306
Find tools.

00:28:04.306 --> 00:28:04.906
We...

00:28:05.265 --> 00:28:06.185
We need to dig quickly.

00:28:06.185 --> 00:28:07.146
Right. Find tools.

00:28:07.146 --> 00:28:07.826
Find tools.

00:28:09.066 --> 00:28:10.306
I will lead the charge.

00:28:11.025 --> 00:28:12.346
Hurry.

00:28:12.906 --> 00:28:13.705
Wu,

00:28:14.106 --> 00:28:14.906
hurry up!

00:28:15.586 --> 00:28:16.386
Oh, no.

00:28:16.705 --> 00:28:17.465
I would never...

00:28:18.025 --> 00:28:18.465
Oh, no.

00:28:18.465 --> 00:28:19.386
Die in this place.

00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:21.346
I don't believe it.

00:28:33.225 --> 00:28:34.025
Pangzi!

00:28:34.185 --> 00:28:34.906
What's wrong?

00:28:35.546 --> 00:28:36.586
Come look at this.

00:28:39.265 --> 00:28:40.066
What's wrong?

00:28:42.665 --> 00:28:43.465
What does this mean?

00:28:47.866 --> 00:28:49.066
This spot here

00:28:49.586 --> 00:28:51.225
was sealed with molten iron.

00:28:52.185 --> 00:28:54.025
Though the ceiling is the thinnest part,

00:28:54.745 --> 00:28:57.306
breaking through
would take over ten hours.

00:28:58.546 --> 00:28:59.465
We can't get out.

00:29:17.546 --> 00:29:18.465
All our calculations

00:29:19.786 --> 00:29:20.705
are useless.

00:29:22.866 --> 00:29:23.985
Another five minutes wasted.

00:29:25.786 --> 00:29:26.546
Enough of it.

00:29:27.025 --> 00:29:27.465
Let's go.

00:29:28.386 --> 00:29:29.346
Head back.

00:29:29.745 --> 00:29:31.346
Retrace our steps.

00:29:32.465 --> 00:29:33.265
Same way out.

00:29:40.665 --> 00:29:41.465
Fine.

00:29:42.665 --> 00:29:44.306
This time, I'm truly done for.

00:29:46.146 --> 00:29:47.465
Completely doomed.

00:29:50.386 --> 00:29:51.786
If only we had explosives.

00:29:52.146 --> 00:29:52.985
What?

00:29:53.185 --> 00:29:55.106
Explosives would solve everything.

00:29:56.745 --> 00:29:57.505
Explosives?

00:30:01.306 --> 00:30:02.465
Do you want roast duck?

00:30:14.945 --> 00:30:16.306
I know where to find some.

00:30:24.745 --> 00:30:25.665
What?

00:30:25.665 --> 00:30:27.386
Are there explosives in his stomach?

00:30:28.505 --> 00:30:29.705
If that's the case,

00:30:30.786 --> 00:30:32.265
it must have been sealed.

00:30:34.106 --> 00:30:35.665
Isolated from air and moisture.

00:30:47.985 --> 00:30:49.066
It's a Treasure Rotor.

00:31:22.705 --> 00:31:23.626
Are you sure?

00:31:24.425 --> 00:31:25.225
Ready?

00:31:26.025 --> 00:31:28.306
Don't worry. I studied architecture.

00:31:29.665 --> 00:31:31.306
I can find the optimal blast point.

00:31:31.866 --> 00:31:32.626
It won't let

00:31:32.626 --> 00:31:33.586
the dome collapse.

00:31:34.546 --> 00:31:35.185
Okay.

00:31:35.705 --> 00:31:36.586
Be careful.

00:31:37.386 --> 00:31:38.225
Stay alert.

00:31:39.146 --> 00:31:40.866
Any minor impact
could trigger an explosion.

00:31:41.906 --> 00:31:42.826
I'll watch your back.

00:31:44.465 --> 00:31:45.225
Don't worry.

00:31:48.106 --> 00:31:48.906
You can make it.

00:32:21.386 --> 00:32:24.265
Let's go Wu Xie. Let's go.

00:32:42.465 --> 00:32:44.386
Wu, why did you freeze?

00:32:44.786 --> 00:32:45.665
Hurry up.

00:32:45.665 --> 00:32:46.906
I'm running out of breath.

00:32:47.225 --> 00:32:48.106
I can't do this.

00:33:40.665 --> 00:33:41.505
Great.

00:33:41.665 --> 00:33:42.465
My turn.

00:33:47.745 --> 00:33:48.586
Secure it properly.

00:33:49.025 --> 00:33:49.626
Okay.

00:33:49.626 --> 00:33:50.505
Start kicking.

00:33:51.505 --> 00:33:52.106
Okay.

00:33:52.586 --> 00:33:53.866
I'm coming!

00:34:15.266 --> 00:34:16.386
Oh, my.

00:34:18.025 --> 00:34:19.145
Wu.

00:34:20.746 --> 00:34:22.505
I think I'm hallucinating.

00:34:23.425 --> 00:34:24.625
I thought I saw...

00:34:26.706 --> 00:34:27.786
I saw this thing...

00:34:29.945 --> 00:34:31.386
It grew a tail.

00:34:31.906 --> 00:34:32.826
Hallucinations?

00:34:33.465 --> 00:34:35.065
Then I'm hallucinating too.

00:34:35.826 --> 00:34:38.585
I even felt this thing

00:34:38.585 --> 00:34:39.226
blowing air.

00:34:39.226 --> 00:34:41.706
What? What's happening?

00:34:42.065 --> 00:34:43.545
But yours wasn't a hallucination.

00:34:44.465 --> 00:34:46.065
It should be an actual tail.

00:34:46.906 --> 00:34:48.425
You didn't hear what Xiaoge just said.

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:50.666
This isn't actually Wang Zanghai.

00:34:51.706 --> 00:34:52.465
Then who is it?

00:34:52.465 --> 00:34:53.465
It's Wang Zanghai's

00:34:53.465 --> 00:34:55.425
animal-skin replica.

00:34:56.866 --> 00:34:57.545
Another monster.

00:34:57.545 --> 00:34:59.025
The tail behind it...

00:34:59.226 --> 00:35:01.786
It should be a monkey's.

00:35:01.945 --> 00:35:02.786
Forget it.

00:35:03.226 --> 00:35:04.025
We don't have time

00:35:04.025 --> 00:35:05.386
to discuss what it really is.

00:35:05.625 --> 00:35:07.386
As long as the explosives aren't damp,

00:35:07.465 --> 00:35:09.226
they'll blow it to pieces.

00:35:09.786 --> 00:35:11.105
Thank you.

00:35:11.306 --> 00:35:14.145
You'll need to be a human detonator.

00:35:16.826 --> 00:35:17.786
What are you doing?

00:35:18.666 --> 00:35:19.985
Stop messing around. Hurry up!

00:35:21.145 --> 00:35:21.906
Pangzi!

00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:23.826
Pangzi, are you okay?

00:36:36.985 --> 00:36:39.226
What's happening now?

00:36:40.545 --> 00:36:41.505
Wu?

00:36:41.985 --> 00:36:43.226
Wu, are you alright?

00:36:45.065 --> 00:36:45.866
This isn't working.

00:36:46.746 --> 00:36:48.226
We need to extract it.

00:36:48.346 --> 00:36:49.186
How?

00:36:49.545 --> 00:36:50.386
Use fishing line.

00:36:51.186 --> 00:36:52.306
I have a fishhook.

00:36:53.346 --> 00:36:54.666
Why would you carry that?

00:36:55.226 --> 00:36:56.025
Don't mind me.

00:37:01.746 --> 00:37:02.465
What you doing?

00:37:08.105 --> 00:37:08.786
Wu!

00:37:09.186 --> 00:37:11.465
Quick! Untie the rope! Untie it!

00:37:13.786 --> 00:37:14.465
Hurry!

00:37:16.346 --> 00:37:17.105
Don't tremble!

00:37:17.666 --> 00:37:18.465
Untie it now!

00:37:19.226 --> 00:37:20.065
Hurry!

00:37:20.866 --> 00:37:21.425
Wu Xie!

00:37:30.386 --> 00:37:31.826
Come on, the hook!

00:37:32.346 --> 00:37:32.945
The hook!

00:37:37.025 --> 00:37:38.545
That sneaky girl, Ning!

00:37:41.186 --> 00:37:42.666
I knew she was faking.

00:37:42.786 --> 00:37:43.746
Take this.

00:37:44.505 --> 00:37:45.306
What are you doing?

00:37:49.826 --> 00:37:51.065
I'm seeing stars.

00:37:51.065 --> 00:37:52.545
What good is chasing her?

00:37:52.945 --> 00:37:54.186
She has oxygen tanks!

00:37:55.386 --> 00:37:56.585
She stole my stuff!

00:37:57.906 --> 00:37:59.306
There's no time left!

00:38:00.706 --> 00:38:02.346
She took my grandfather's notebook!

00:38:03.906 --> 00:38:05.545
Who cares what she took?

00:38:05.826 --> 00:38:07.025
Do you value your life?

00:38:16.826 --> 00:38:17.585
Wu!

00:38:18.505 --> 00:38:20.105
Only five minutes left!

00:38:23.746 --> 00:38:24.545
Sir.

00:38:24.786 --> 00:38:25.746
Sorry, sir.

00:38:31.346 --> 00:38:32.145
Wu.

00:38:33.666 --> 00:38:34.465
Wu!

00:38:35.266 --> 00:38:36.065
Wu!

00:38:45.866 --> 00:38:46.746
Focus.

00:38:47.186 --> 00:38:48.145
Don't get distracted.

00:38:48.306 --> 00:38:49.266
Focus. Focus!

00:38:49.386 --> 00:38:49.985
Be gentle.

00:38:51.306 --> 00:38:52.866
No. My hands are shaking. You do it.

00:38:57.746 --> 00:38:58.545
Hurry up.

00:38:58.545 --> 00:38:59.505
Stop rushing me.

00:38:59.505 --> 00:39:00.826
We're running out of time.

00:39:05.105 --> 00:39:06.826
How is it? Did the hook catch?

00:39:07.706 --> 00:39:08.105
Harder!

00:39:08.105 --> 00:39:08.906
It's hooked.

00:39:09.186 --> 00:39:09.945
Harder!

00:39:14.746 --> 00:39:15.666
How is it?

00:39:15.666 --> 00:39:17.065
Wait! It's stuck.

00:39:20.625 --> 00:39:21.505
Pull!

00:39:54.786 --> 00:39:55.826
Wu Xie!

00:39:56.346 --> 00:39:57.226
Xiaoge!

00:41:21.386 --> 00:41:22.786
Xiaoge!

00:42:14.186 --> 00:42:14.985
Are you all right?

00:42:15.746 --> 00:42:16.545
I'm fine.

00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:22.186
This...

00:42:22.985 --> 00:42:25.866
This isn't working properly.

00:42:27.505 --> 00:42:28.585
What do we do now?

00:42:29.105 --> 00:42:30.160
The explosion didn't work.

00:42:32.746 --> 00:42:35.346
Xiaoge, can you get another one?

00:42:43.906 --> 00:42:44.985
This is interesting.

00:42:45.585 --> 00:42:46.706
We're almost succeeding.

00:43:13.625 --> 00:43:14.666
What's happening?

00:43:14.945 --> 00:43:16.386
This is unbelievable.

00:43:27.065 --> 00:43:28.186
What now?

00:43:28.545 --> 00:43:29.906
This isn't going as planned.

00:43:29.906 --> 00:43:31.425
The fish will be here soon.

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:48.186
The explosion breached the room!

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:49.466
There's no time.

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.347
- Wu!
- To the passage.

00:01:50.347 --> 00:01:52.386
This isn't what you meant
by blowing a hole!

00:01:53.147 --> 00:01:53.987
Where are we going?

00:01:54.627 --> 00:01:55.587
Move it!

00:02:03.947 --> 00:02:04.906
Wu!

00:02:05.627 --> 00:02:06.546
Wu, hurry!

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:14.787
Move!

00:02:14.787 --> 00:02:15.146
Okay.

00:02:15.586 --> 00:02:16.307
Pangzi, let's go.

00:02:16.307 --> 00:02:17.106
Go, go, go!

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:17.907
Hurry!

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.233
Can this work?

00:04:04.907 --> 00:04:06.146
It's blocked!

00:04:07.627 --> 00:04:08.546
Wu!

00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:10.266
Are you sure it won't collapse?

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:12.227
It won't. The space here is compact.

00:04:12.227 --> 00:04:13.146
It shouldn't.

00:04:24.786 --> 00:04:26.146
It's too much water!

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:34.867
It's flooding in!

00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:57.427
Wu Xie!

00:04:58.026 --> 00:04:59.107
Wu Xie!

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:02.586
Wu Xie!

00:05:04.547 --> 00:05:05.346
You okay?

00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:06.067
I'm fine.

00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:07.667
I'm fine.

00:05:07.747 --> 00:05:08.507
Where's Xiaoge?

00:05:11.867 --> 00:05:12.466
Alright.

00:05:12.706 --> 00:05:13.667
I'll find the exit.

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:15.346
No, Pangzi!

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:38.266
Pangzi, over here.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.187
Wu.

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:46.146
This door won't budge.

00:05:47.586 --> 00:05:48.547
We need equal pressure

00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:50.507
inside and outside
before the door can open.

00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:52.786
Why didn't you say that?

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:54.226
You dived too fast!

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:55.987
What now?

00:05:56.067 --> 00:05:56.826
We wait.

00:05:57.067 --> 00:05:57.947
And do nothing?

00:05:58.386 --> 00:05:59.187
Xiaoge,

00:05:59.706 --> 00:06:00.786
any other ideas?

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:02.386
I trust him.

00:06:02.867 --> 00:06:05.466
Don't act like I don't trust him.

00:06:06.826 --> 00:06:07.427
Fine then.

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:08.706
Let's wait here.

00:06:09.226 --> 00:06:10.826
We'll face death together at worst.

00:06:20.586 --> 00:06:21.507
How much longer?

00:06:22.146 --> 00:06:22.906
Just wait.

00:06:23.947 --> 00:06:24.987
The water's rising fast.

00:06:36.507 --> 00:06:37.616
- About time?
- Go.

00:07:54.906 --> 00:07:56.226
The current's too strong.

00:07:56.786 --> 00:07:57.826
How do we get out?

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:00.466
Wait a bit longer.

00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:03.146
Until it reached the top.

00:08:03.146 --> 00:08:04.067
Hold your breath.

00:08:04.507 --> 00:08:07.026

Finally.

00:11:57.547 --> 00:11:58.746
Come on.

00:12:02.787 --> 00:12:03.547
Sit properly.

00:12:03.547 --> 00:12:04.147
Doctor!

00:12:04.147 --> 00:12:05.427
Doctor!

00:12:05.706 --> 00:12:06.466
He's awake.

00:12:18.626 --> 00:12:19.506
How is he?

00:12:19.866 --> 00:12:20.746
Looks good.

00:12:21.067 --> 00:12:21.866
In a couple of days,

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:22.746
he can be discharged.

00:12:22.746 --> 00:12:24.387
Good. That's good.

00:12:24.947 --> 00:12:25.466
Thank you.

00:12:25.626 --> 00:12:26.307
My pleasure.

00:12:27.027 --> 00:12:28.626
Just send a nurse next time.

00:12:29.866 --> 00:12:30.667
Pangzi.

00:12:31.427 --> 00:12:32.226
How do you feel?

00:12:34.226 --> 00:12:36.947
Was it a dream?

00:13:07.267 --> 00:13:08.746
Who saved me?

00:13:09.267 --> 00:13:10.947
Who else could it be?

00:13:11.746 --> 00:13:12.986
Xiaoge, of course.

00:13:14.427 --> 00:13:16.267
So young and already losing hair?

00:13:20.387 --> 00:13:21.147
Where's Xiaoge?

00:13:22.307 --> 00:13:23.387
You think everyone's

00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:25.746
as loyal as me?

00:13:26.547 --> 00:13:28.346
I watched over you for three days.

00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:30.947
And your first words were,
"Where's Xiaoge?"

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:33.267
Well,

00:13:33.267 --> 00:13:35.586
he left you a red notebook.

00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:36.706
By now,

00:13:36.706 --> 00:13:38.226
he's probably at the pier.

00:13:40.706 --> 00:13:41.626
Wait, ma'am!

00:13:41.826 --> 00:13:42.267
Wait!

00:13:42.267 --> 00:13:43.027
No boarding.

00:13:43.027 --> 00:13:43.706
It's full.

00:13:43.706 --> 00:13:44.586
I'm not boarding.

00:13:44.586 --> 00:13:45.706
I'm meeting a friend.

00:13:45.706 --> 00:13:47.706
- Then make it quick.
- Xiaoge! Xiaoge!

00:14:15.947 --> 00:14:16.907
(In the end,)

00:14:16.907 --> 00:14:18.746
(I never got to thank Xiaoge properly)

00:14:19.506 --> 00:14:20.866
(or say goodbye.)

00:14:22.626 --> 00:14:24.187
(He put some pages of his speculations)

00:14:24.187 --> 00:14:26.226
(about the shipwreck and my third uncle)

00:14:27.027 --> 00:14:28.826
(Wu Laogou's Notebook)
(in my grandpa's notes.)

00:14:30.346 --> 00:14:32.226
(I don't know what the truth really is)

00:14:33.626 --> 00:14:34.427
(or whether)

00:14:34.427 --> 00:14:36.466
(I should continue investigating.)

00:14:38.187 --> 00:14:39.226
(I recalled some words)

00:14:39.226 --> 00:14:40.947
(Third Uncle once said to me.)

00:14:42.427 --> 00:14:44.866
(Did he actually leave clues long ago?)

00:15:03.547 --> 00:15:04.586
What did you see?

00:15:05.547 --> 00:15:07.267
You threw a stone down.

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:09.986
Do you think

00:15:11.267 --> 00:15:12.667
it would ever go down

00:15:13.346 --> 00:15:14.706
if I didn't throw it?

00:15:18.746 --> 00:15:19.626
Probably.

00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:22.267
Rainwater would wash it down.

00:15:29.866 --> 00:15:31.787
Do you think
there are fish in the water?

00:15:33.787 --> 00:15:34.667
Of course.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.027
It's such a huge pond.

00:15:37.466 --> 00:15:41.106
Do you think
fish hold value while in water

00:15:42.427 --> 00:15:44.986
or gain value when taken out of it?

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:47.267
They should be

00:15:48.346 --> 00:15:49.392
more valuable in water.

00:15:51.427 --> 00:15:55.307
But fish left uncaught

00:15:55.307 --> 00:15:57.826
can't be traded

00:15:57.826 --> 00:15:59.547
or priced,

00:16:00.226 --> 00:16:02.506
so they're practically worthless.

00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:08.346
Let me ask you this.

00:16:09.067 --> 00:16:10.466
If you had to choose,

00:16:10.907 --> 00:16:12.866
would you rather be a stone

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:15.866
or a fish?

00:16:22.826 --> 00:16:24.027
It makes no difference.

00:16:31.147 --> 00:16:31.947
Third Uncle,

00:16:32.307 --> 00:16:34.826
I'm still thinking
about the fish and stone analogy.

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:49.226
You're still stuck on that?

00:16:51.067 --> 00:16:52.187
What's to choose?

00:16:53.787 --> 00:16:54.907
Some questions

00:16:54.907 --> 00:16:56.986
sound profound at first

00:16:57.307 --> 00:17:00.506
but are ultimately meaningless.

00:17:01.626 --> 00:17:02.706
We're humans.

00:17:03.067 --> 00:17:06.066
Why choose between a stone and a fish?

00:17:21.147 --> 00:17:21.986
Third Uncle?

00:17:23.786 --> 00:17:24.706
Third Uncle?

I know you're upset.

00:19:41.746 --> 00:19:42.827
It's my fault

00:19:42.907 --> 00:19:45.147
for not finding your third uncle
or third auntie.

00:19:45.746 --> 00:19:46.187
Right?

00:19:46.387 --> 00:19:47.280
Or third great-aunt.

00:19:48.746 --> 00:19:49.786
Look at it differently.

00:19:51.986 --> 00:19:53.986
Who's your third uncle?

00:19:54.786 --> 00:19:56.266
A seasoned veteran.

00:19:56.266 --> 00:19:57.226
Don't even compare me.

00:19:57.226 --> 00:19:58.387
Look at yourself.

00:19:58.387 --> 00:20:00.187
If even you escaped that shipwreck,

00:20:00.187 --> 00:20:01.587
how could your third uncle not?

00:20:02.746 --> 00:20:03.266
He's probably

00:20:03.266 --> 00:20:04.907
feasting somewhere right now.

00:20:05.947 --> 00:20:07.066
He didn't want you around.

00:20:07.387 --> 00:20:08.147
Think about it.

00:20:09.746 --> 00:20:10.546
If he

00:20:11.947 --> 00:20:12.986
truly got out,

00:20:13.427 --> 00:20:14.827
why didn't he

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:16.746
send me messages

00:20:16.746 --> 00:20:17.546
or answer

00:20:18.667 --> 00:20:19.546
when I called?

00:20:19.546 --> 00:20:20.466
What's wrong?

00:20:20.947 --> 00:20:22.147
It's perfectly normal.

00:20:24.226 --> 00:20:25.506
Your third uncle's practically

00:20:25.786 --> 00:20:27.147
half a father to you.

00:20:27.867 --> 00:20:30.066
Since when do sons
boss around their fathers?

00:20:30.627 --> 00:20:31.986
What a joke!

00:20:34.427 --> 00:20:36.627
Your third uncle has his own life

00:20:36.627 --> 00:20:37.986
and his own plans.

00:20:37.986 --> 00:20:38.947
Right?

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:40.546
Just respect his choices.

00:20:40.546 --> 00:20:41.986
Don't try to control him.

00:20:42.466 --> 00:20:43.786
You're not his father.

00:20:45.026 --> 00:20:45.867
What's the nonsense?

00:20:46.986 --> 00:20:48.226
Revisiting that shipwreck?

00:20:49.107 --> 00:20:50.427
It's been over 20 years.

00:20:51.026 --> 00:20:52.466
He still wants to find Ms. Wenjin.

00:20:52.986 --> 00:20:54.026
What's wrong with that?

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:56.546
That's devotion.

00:20:57.427 --> 00:20:58.667
As for your third uncle now,

00:20:59.387 --> 00:21:01.667
whether he's searching for Ms. Wenjin

00:21:01.667 --> 00:21:03.466
or chasing Wang Zanghai's secrets,

00:21:03.466 --> 00:21:04.387
either way,

00:21:04.387 --> 00:21:07.466
it all connects back
to the Heavenly Palace on the Clouds.

00:21:08.066 --> 00:21:09.427
That gives us a lead.

00:21:10.066 --> 00:21:10.867
Right?

00:21:12.587 --> 00:21:13.627
That means,

00:21:13.627 --> 00:21:15.107
to find clues about Third Uncle,

00:21:16.466 --> 00:21:19.347
I must start with studying

00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:20.427
Wang Zanghai

00:21:20.427 --> 00:21:22.226
and his shipwreck.

00:21:22.226 --> 00:21:22.907
Exactly.

00:21:23.266 --> 00:21:25.546
You already have the upper hand.

00:21:26.026 --> 00:21:26.827
What upper hand?

00:21:27.266 --> 00:21:28.187
What do you have?

00:21:29.427 --> 00:21:29.947
The fish.

00:21:29.947 --> 00:21:30.427
Right.

00:21:31.066 --> 00:21:32.627
The Snake-Eyebrow Copper Fish.

00:21:34.986 --> 00:21:37.387
But I handed over the two real ones.

00:21:37.907 --> 00:21:40.266
Now I only own the replicas I had made.

00:21:40.427 --> 00:21:41.947
Replicas work fine.

00:21:42.306 --> 00:21:43.147
Think about it.

00:21:44.347 --> 00:21:45.587
What was Wang Zanghai like?

00:21:46.466 --> 00:21:47.226
One of the few

00:21:47.226 --> 00:21:48.746
even craftier than your third uncle.

00:21:49.147 --> 00:21:51.226
Do you think his mechanisms

00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:53.306
were carelessly built?

00:21:54.587 --> 00:21:56.627
They were meticulously designed.

00:21:57.347 --> 00:21:57.986
Right?

00:21:58.347 --> 00:22:00.026
For all three Snake-Eyebrow Copper Fish,

00:22:01.587 --> 00:22:03.466
you already have
the replicas of two of them.

00:22:03.746 --> 00:22:04.786
And for the last one,

00:22:04.786 --> 00:22:05.907
whether someone else has it

00:22:05.907 --> 00:22:06.907
or it's hidden somewhere,

00:22:07.466 --> 00:22:08.506
if anyone wants

00:22:08.506 --> 00:22:10.107
to know the Heavenly Palace's secrets,

00:22:10.107 --> 00:22:11.947
they'll have to come to you first.

00:22:14.107 --> 00:22:16.587
So all you need to do now is one thing:

00:22:18.427 --> 00:22:19.786
wait with the fake fish.

00:22:19.786 --> 00:22:20.627
That's all.

00:22:24.387 --> 00:22:25.187
Come on.

00:22:26.107 --> 00:22:27.387
Didn't know you had this in you.

00:22:30.667 --> 00:22:31.786
But there's one thing

00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:33.306
I still don't understand.

00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:38.107
Why did Wang Zanghai fill the shipwreck

00:22:38.107 --> 00:22:39.187
with so many

00:22:39.187 --> 00:22:40.506
bizarre creatures?

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:42.026
About that,

00:22:42.986 --> 00:22:43.546
when Xiaoge

00:22:43.546 --> 00:22:45.107
returned the notebook to me earlier,

00:22:45.706 --> 00:22:46.947
he slipped in some papers

00:22:47.546 --> 00:22:48.986
with his theories.

00:22:49.427 --> 00:22:50.266
What did he say?

00:22:51.026 --> 00:22:52.387
He thinks Wang Zanghai

00:22:52.627 --> 00:22:55.107
was also experimenting with immortality.

00:22:56.226 --> 00:22:57.706
He likely visited King of Lu's kiln

00:22:58.266 --> 00:23:00.706
and obtained that meteorite jade.

00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:03.387
In King Shang of Lu's experiment,

00:23:03.387 --> 00:23:05.466
he placed himself
inside the meteorite jade

00:23:05.627 --> 00:23:06.786
to pursue immortality.

00:23:08.947 --> 00:23:10.226
But Wang Zanghai

00:23:10.506 --> 00:23:11.746
saw what happened to him

00:23:12.107 --> 00:23:13.786
and realized that path was futile.

00:23:14.947 --> 00:23:16.266
So he used the jade to make pills

00:23:16.506 --> 00:23:18.226
and experimented on animals.

00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:21.506
Unexpectedly, the animals mutated.

00:23:22.066 --> 00:23:23.546
(Like the sea monkeys)

00:23:24.066 --> 00:23:25.546
(and that white-haired monster.)

00:23:26.587 --> 00:23:27.827
And the Forbidden Woman?

00:23:28.266 --> 00:23:30.187
It was a mutated nematode

00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:33.026
that emitted
a fragrant hallucinogenic gas.

00:23:34.107 --> 00:23:34.907
It's fragrant.

00:23:37.947 --> 00:23:38.947
Forbidden Woman's Scent.

00:23:39.706 --> 00:23:40.706
It smells fragrant.

00:23:41.506 --> 00:23:42.427
Do you smell it?

00:23:43.187 --> 00:23:44.066
Such a scent

00:23:44.066 --> 00:23:46.066
tricks you into thinking
it's from a woman's hair.

00:23:46.827 --> 00:23:48.066
How's your back doing?

00:23:50.026 --> 00:23:50.986
Much better.

00:23:50.986 --> 00:23:51.986
Almost healed.

00:23:52.466 --> 00:23:54.266
The doctor said it's a fungal infection.

00:23:54.746 --> 00:23:55.587
Didn't ask for more.

00:23:59.587 --> 00:24:00.266
By the way,

00:24:00.266 --> 00:24:01.026
I just remembered

00:24:02.026 --> 00:24:02.786
that lotion

00:24:02.786 --> 00:24:04.466
you applied on me back then.

00:24:04.466 --> 00:24:04.986
What was it?

00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:05.746
You didn't tell me.

00:24:09.066 --> 00:24:10.266
It's export-grade stuff.

00:24:10.266 --> 00:24:11.347
I told you.

00:24:11.827 --> 00:24:12.827
I'll go find it

00:24:12.947 --> 00:24:13.746
and give it to you.

00:24:14.347 --> 00:24:15.147
I heard you.

00:24:16.026 --> 00:24:17.026
A promise...

00:24:20.627 --> 00:24:22.107
Is a promise.

00:24:27.026 --> 00:24:27.786
Wu,

00:24:30.506 --> 00:24:31.506
after this meal,

00:24:32.506 --> 00:24:33.746
I will be taking off.

00:24:39.026 --> 00:24:39.667
Well,

00:24:40.827 --> 00:24:42.066
we managed

00:24:43.026 --> 00:24:43.947
to scrape through

00:24:45.827 --> 00:24:47.066
the whole chaotic journey

00:24:47.706 --> 00:24:48.746
full of twists and turns.

00:24:50.667 --> 00:24:51.746
The world isn't that big.

00:24:52.746 --> 00:24:53.546
If fate allows,

00:24:54.187 --> 00:24:55.187
we'll meet again.

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:56.427
Stay safe.

00:25:07.147 --> 00:25:08.827
Don't mind my nagging.

00:25:10.427 --> 00:25:12.187
One last thing before I go:

00:25:15.627 --> 00:25:16.546
Your name's Wu Xie,

00:25:19.312 --> 00:25:21.008
meaning innocence, but don't be naive.

00:25:22.627 --> 00:25:23.427
Out there,

00:25:24.187 --> 00:25:24.947
not everyone

00:25:24.947 --> 00:25:26.786
is as decent as me.

00:25:29.387 --> 00:25:30.427
Come on, bottoms up.

00:25:33.546 --> 00:25:34.427
Till we meet again.

00:25:37.026 --> 00:25:37.786
Till we meet again.

00:25:59.706 --> 00:26:00.867
(This expedition)

00:26:01.667 --> 00:26:03.026
(has been more bizarre)

00:26:03.226 --> 00:26:05.147
(and unimaginable
than I ever predicted.)

00:26:05.786 --> 00:26:07.026
(Truthfully,)

00:26:07.347 --> 00:26:08.387
(many details)

00:26:08.387 --> 00:26:09.986
(have become foggy in my memory.)

00:26:10.466 --> 00:26:11.746
(Some events)

00:26:11.746 --> 00:26:13.667
(don't connect logically at all.)

00:26:14.786 --> 00:26:16.867
(So I'll record my journey)

00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:18.107
(in the most beautiful)

00:26:18.306 --> 00:26:19.907
(and logical way to me.)

00:26:22.986 --> 00:26:23.986
(I wonder)

00:26:24.306 --> 00:26:24.587
(what)

00:26:24.587 --> 00:26:27.147
(my descendants will think)

00:26:27.226 --> 00:26:28.546
(when reading this journal.)

00:26:30.546 --> 00:26:31.746
(Yet for a moment,)

00:26:32.786 --> 00:26:35.026
(I think I feel what Grandpa felt)

00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:38.026
(when writing his notes.)

00:27:19.627 --> 00:27:21.107
Did you get it?

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:22.347
It's done.

00:27:33.482 --> 00:27:38.704
(Missing Person Notice)

00:27:38.704 --> 00:27:40.976
(The fish is with me.)

00:28:22.746 --> 00:28:24.667
Wu Sanxing tricked us.

00:28:24.947 --> 00:28:27.947
He knew
we would send someone down again.

00:28:28.306 --> 00:28:29.427
So he set a trap.

00:28:31.827 --> 00:28:33.147
He wasn't in the boat.

00:28:34.667 --> 00:28:35.746
He must've gotten

00:28:35.746 --> 00:28:37.947
what he wanted and left.

00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:43.746
But I also found something.

00:28:45.026 --> 00:28:46.627
His plan has a flaw.

00:28:47.226 --> 00:28:50.587
He never thought
his nephew would save me.

00:28:53.347 --> 00:28:54.427
I will leave now

00:28:55.427 --> 00:28:57.026
with information.

00:29:15.667 --> 00:29:16.506
Wu Sanxing.

00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:24.587
I'm back.

00:29:25.107 --> 00:29:26.266
Did you miss me?

00:29:30.867 --> 00:29:31.947
What are you doing?

00:29:36.147 --> 00:29:38.107
Wash your face
and clean the wounds properly.

00:29:38.387 --> 00:29:40.147
You'll get scars this way.

00:29:40.427 --> 00:29:42.627
I knew you'd mess it up

00:29:42.627 --> 00:29:44.466
with your recklessness.

00:29:45.266 --> 00:29:47.266
I didn't expect
you'd care about my looks.

00:29:47.466 --> 00:29:49.506
Worried about facial scars?

00:29:49.746 --> 00:29:51.306
Enough nagging.

00:29:51.306 --> 00:29:53.107
The problem is resolved. That's enough.

00:29:53.506 --> 00:29:54.506
Solved?

00:29:55.466 --> 00:29:56.786
You left behind such a mess,

00:29:56.786 --> 00:29:58.506
and I have to clean it up for you.

00:29:59.306 --> 00:30:00.107
You know what?

00:30:00.107 --> 00:30:01.947
Xie almost died because of you.

00:30:02.466 --> 00:30:04.147
You dragged him into this.

00:30:04.627 --> 00:30:05.986
Didn't I warn you

00:30:05.986 --> 00:30:07.627
to keep him out of the mission?

00:30:07.627 --> 00:30:08.387
Didn't I?

00:30:08.587 --> 00:30:10.746
I had my reasons.

00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:12.627
You always do.

00:30:18.066 --> 00:30:19.187
Well,

00:30:19.187 --> 00:30:21.147
we have to consider the bigger picture.

00:30:21.506 --> 00:30:22.947
The bigger picture?

00:30:24.226 --> 00:30:25.627
Ever considered

00:30:26.187 --> 00:30:27.427
your methods

00:30:27.427 --> 00:30:29.587
are precisely why

00:30:29.587 --> 00:30:30.947
we're trapped

00:30:30.947 --> 00:30:32.786
in this endless cycle?

00:30:34.266 --> 00:30:35.226
It's been years.

00:30:37.667 --> 00:30:38.627
Aren't you tired?

00:30:39.147 --> 00:30:40.427
I'm sick of it.

00:30:40.427 --> 00:30:41.746
You think I'm not?

00:30:41.746 --> 00:30:43.587
You think I enjoy wearing your face?

00:30:43.587 --> 00:30:44.986
Perfect.

00:30:44.986 --> 00:30:46.026
Let's end this.

00:30:46.026 --> 00:30:48.226
Isn't it better
if we each return to our own lives?

00:30:48.226 --> 00:30:50.786
Do you think I can still have a life?

00:31:01.706 --> 00:31:03.026
The time hasn't come yet.

00:31:04.427 --> 00:31:07.187
Even if we're unwilling,
we have to keep going.

00:31:07.627 --> 00:31:08.466
Right?

00:31:11.746 --> 00:31:12.546
Never mind.

00:31:12.867 --> 00:31:14.746
I know how to get
to the Heavenly Palace now.

00:31:15.147 --> 00:31:16.266
I will find Wenjin.

00:31:16.506 --> 00:31:19.827
You can clean up the mess for me.

00:31:23.506 --> 00:31:26.226
Make sure you make it spotless.

Wang Meng.

00:34:19.427 --> 00:34:20.336
Young Third Master!

00:34:20.947 --> 00:34:22.106
Has Third Master returned?

00:34:22.666 --> 00:34:25.146
Third Master hasn't come back at all.

00:34:25.947 --> 00:34:28.347
But there was a strange person
who claimed

00:34:28.347 --> 00:34:29.466
to be your brother.

00:34:29.586 --> 00:34:31.347
He insisted I tell him your whereabouts.

00:34:32.186 --> 00:34:33.106
A strange person?

00:34:33.907 --> 00:34:36.586
Yeah, he looked

00:34:36.586 --> 00:34:37.827
slippery and cunning,

00:34:37.827 --> 00:34:39.146
not seeming trustworthy at all.

00:34:39.146 --> 00:34:40.227
So I sent him away.

00:34:40.827 --> 00:34:42.066
But before leaving,

00:34:42.066 --> 00:34:43.347
he left a phone number.

00:34:43.347 --> 00:34:44.666
How old did he look?

00:34:45.066 --> 00:34:46.827
Well, it's hard to say.

00:34:46.827 --> 00:34:48.146
He seemed

00:34:48.146 --> 00:34:49.227
more mature than you.

00:34:50.227 --> 00:34:52.466
Did he stutter when speaking?

00:34:53.227 --> 00:34:54.066
Yes. Exactly.

00:34:54.267 --> 00:34:55.186
That guy

00:34:55.186 --> 00:34:57.586
stuttered a dozen times per sentence.

00:34:57.586 --> 00:34:58.867
Give me his number.

00:34:58.867 --> 00:34:59.867
Right away.

00:35:11.227 --> 00:35:13.026
W-Who is it?

00:35:14.586 --> 00:35:16.186
Can't even recognize my voice,

00:35:16.466 --> 00:35:17.307
Lao Yang?

00:35:18.026 --> 00:35:19.707
Bro!

00:35:20.186 --> 00:35:21.907
When are you free?

00:35:21.907 --> 00:35:23.066
Let's meet up.

00:35:24.506 --> 00:35:27.947
I need your help with something crucial.

00:35:28.347 --> 00:35:29.106
What is it?

00:35:29.106 --> 00:35:33.347
I found an extremely bizarre place.

00:35:33.347 --> 00:35:35.186
There's a tree inside

00:35:35.307 --> 00:35:38.666
bigger than any tree you've ever seen.

00:35:38.986 --> 00:35:41.506
It's beyond your imagination.

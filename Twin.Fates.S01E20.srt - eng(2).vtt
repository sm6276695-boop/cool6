=Episode 20=
(The Return of Consciousness)

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.760
Who is this?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.240
I never I'd find a body

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.960
in this secret chamber.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.920
Your Majesty.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.280
He's Lord Scarlet Flame, Yanlie.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.760
After his death, Bai Li removed
his primordial soul

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.880
before putting it into your body.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.600
My body?

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.680
Mm.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.840
How could that be?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.320
I'll tell you everything

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.160
in detail after this.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.080
Please keep your words

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.990
and remove the golden phoenix feather
out of this body.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.800
Golden phoenix...

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.560
Golden feather...

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.280
There's a divine beast's primordial soul
in your body.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.080
And this golden feather
only resonates with you.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.440
You're still alive?

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.560
Li Cang, you're outrageous!

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.680
(No way,)

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.120
(this black miasma is just like
what Chi Yu had then.)

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.200
(Could it be...)

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.280
He's not Li Cang.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.360
I thought of making you
the ruler of Hong.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.160
To my surprise, you've been useless.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.520
Since that's the case,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.520
someone else should take the throne.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.120
You're here for me, aren't you?

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.690
Surrender the golden phoenix feather

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.960
and I'll go with you.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.760
Hmph.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.160
I will take

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.640
both of your lives!

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.400
Chi Yu, now!

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.920
The Silver Fox Clan has tried
to sow discord between Chi Yu and Ji Yuchen

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.120
in order to take advantage of it
and seize the golden feather,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.490
giving birth to a disaster
in the mortal realm.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.720
I must stop them.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.760
Please come up with a reading
when it is time.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.600
And pass this token to Chi Yu.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.800
He remembers what my blood smells like.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.360
Chi Yu, quick!

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.480
Get the golden phoenix feather!

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.320
Chi Yu, you've regained
your consciousness.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.400
Don't you marry him.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.080
You're mine.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.160
Well,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.200
I was rude to you then.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.040
I really had no idea what I was doing.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.160
I understand.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.320
You weren't yourself,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.840
and you didn't mean to hurt me.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.920
There are two souls in you.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.320
We finally know the truth.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.040
As for

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.040
the wedding...

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.560
Of course it's not valid.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.920
What will you do

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.920
after this?

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.640
Now that I've regained my consciousness

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.210
and the contract has come into effect,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.040
it's time to settle
both old and new scores

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.040
with the Silver Fox Clan.

00:06:31.537 --> 00:06:32.537
I'll wait for your return.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.720
Where is Yanlie's
golden phoenix feather?

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.480
The contract
between Mu Lingxue and Chi Yu

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.240
is way too powerful.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.800
I couldn't withstand it,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.080
and they managed to seize
Yanlie's golden phoenix feather.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.640
Now Chi Yu's consciousness and powers
have been restored.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.080
The Soul-Pulling Spell on Yanlie

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.000
is gone too.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.320
You good-for-nothing!

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.560
My carefully crafted plan
has gone down the drain because of you!

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.280
Have you lost your mind?

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.080
How dare you betray me!

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.040
You think a mere tiny dagger

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.440
can kill me?

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.160
I'll give you an ugly death.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.040
Ah!

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.120
Go to hell

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.480
and be a ruler as you please.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.200
How can this...

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.200
Master.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.760
Take a good look at it.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.400
This is Windcutter,
the dagger you gave me.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.800
It's used to slay
divine and demonic beasts.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.680
(Well done.)

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.480
Master.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.360
I'll get you the Xuanzhu Jade
as soon as possible.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.560
For the sake of power and glory,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.400
I'll make it happen at all costs.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.360
Bai Li, show yourself!

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.200
Bai Li's primordial spirit
has escaped again, hasn't it?

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.840
No. Her consciousness and spirit
are both destroyed.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.680
An Sha killed her.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.920
(It's all over now.)

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:01.840
Let's go home.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.960
(Grand Tutor Mu Heng)

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.480
(had always been a diligent
and dedicated subject.)

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.040
(Unfortunately,)

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.000
(he was framed by traitor Li Cang.)

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.520
(My negligence)

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.440
(has wronged such a loyal subject,)

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.240
(leading to this tragedy.)

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.960
(I)

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.520
(Memorial Tablet of Late Father, Mu Heng)
(feel deeply regret.)

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.440
(With this edict of self-blame,)

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.240
(I'd like)

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.280
(to clear Grand Tutor's family's name
and restore their innocence.)

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.680
(Grand Tutor Mu Heng)

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.480
(deserves to be part
of the ancestral temple,)

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.400
(and he shall be conferred
the title of Duke Mu)

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.880
(to display my repentance)

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.160
(and my utmost respect
for his achievements.)

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.000
(Father.)

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.080
(Mother.)

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.880
(At last, I've cleared your name.)

00:10:14.675 --> 00:10:17.937
(Memorial Tablet of Late Father, Mu Heng)

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.720
(Once I've completed the sacrifice)

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.200
(for you on the Day of Xihe,)

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.160
(you shall always
be under this sunlight)

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.280
(and live as freely as you do now.)
